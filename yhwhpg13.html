Here are the words to the 2001 song, In Christ Alone, originally by Keith Getty.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Christ alone my hope is found<br>
He is my light, my strength, my song<br>
This cornerstone, this solid ground<br>
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm<br>
What heights of love, what depths of peace<br>
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease<br>
My comforter, my all in all<br>
Here in the love of Christ I stand<br>
<br>
<br>
In Christ alone who took on flesh<br>
Fullness of God in helpless babe<br>
This gift of love and righteousness<br>
Scorned by the ones He came to save<br>
Till on that cross as Jesus died<br>
The wrath of God was satisfied<br>
For every sin on Him was laid<br>
Here in the death of Christ I live<br>
<br>
<br>
There in the ground His body lay<br>
Light of the world by darkness slain<br>
Then bursting forth in glorious day<br>
Up from the grave He rose again<br>
And as He stands in victory<br>
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me<br>
For I am His and He is mine<br>
Bought with the precious blood of Christ<br>
<br>
<br>
No guilt in life, no fear in death<br>
This is the power of Christ in me<br>
From life's first cry to final breath<br>
Jesus commands my destiny<br>
No power of hell, no scheme of man<br>
Can ever pluck me from His hand<br>
Till He returns or calls me home<br>
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

"How Great Thou Art" originally was an 1885 Christian hymn based on a<br>
Swedish traditional melody and a poem, titled, O Great God,<br>
written by Carl Boberg, and later Translated into English, and made into an English hymn by Stuart K. Hine in 1949.<br>
<br>
The 1949 English hymn version became the best-loved hymn of the Billy Graham Crusades. They used it over and over again. In New York, in 1957, it was used more than 100 times by George Beverly Shea and the Crusade Choir in 119 meetings. In 1959, it became the theme of Billy Graham's "Hour of Decision" weekly radio broadcast.<br>
<br>
Evangelist Billy Graham was once quoted as saying:<br>
"The reason I like 'How Great Thou Art' is because it glorifies God. It turns Christian's eyes toward God, rather than upon themselves. I use it as often as possible because it is such a God-honouring song."<br>
<br>
Lawrence Welk, who hosted the television programme, The Lawrence Welk Show, from 1951 to 1982, has been quoted as saying, "Of all the songs, both religious and secular, How Great Thou Art, was the most requested song for our television programme."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the various lyrics and verses, translated into English.<br>
The early, original, international and alternate verses are presented here first,<br>
followed by the Commonly used English lyrics, of the hymn, How Great Thou Art...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
O mighty God, when I behold the wonder<br>
Of nature's beauty, wrought by words of thine,<br>
And how thou leadest all from realms up yonder,<br>
Sustaining earthly life with love benign,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With rapture filled, my soul thy name would laud,<br>
O mighty God! O mighty God!<br>
With rapture filled, my soul thy name would laud,<br>
O mighty God! O mighty God!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When I behold the heavens in their vastness,<br>
Where golden ships in azure issue forth,<br>
Where sun and moon keep watch upon the fastness<br>
Of changing seasons and of time on earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
When crushed by guilt of sin before thee kneeling,<br>
I plead for mercy and for grace and peace,<br>
I feel thy balm and, all my bruises healing,<br>
My soul is filled, my heart is set at ease.<br>
<br>
<br>
And when at last the mists of time have vanished<br>
And I in truth my faith confirmed shall see,<br>
Upon the shores where earthly ills are banished<br>
I'll enter Lord, to dwell in peace with thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With rapture filled, my soul thy name would laud,<br>
O mighty God! O mighty God!<br>
With rapture filled, my soul thy name would laud,<br>
O mighty God! O mighty God!<br>
<br>
<br>
O when I see ungrateful man defiling<br>
This bounteous earth, God's gifts so good and great;<br>
In foolish pride, God's holy Name reviling,<br>
And yet, in grace, His wrath and judgement wait.<br>
<br>
<br>
When burdens press, and seem beyond endurance,<br>
Bowed down with grief, to Him I lift my face;<br>
And then in love He brings me sweet assurance:<br>
'My child! for thee sufficient is my grace'.<br>
<br>
<br>
When I the world consider<br>
Which Thou has made by Thine almighty Word<br>
And how the web of life Thy wisdom guideth<br>
And all creation feedeth at Thy board.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then doth my soul burst forth in song of praise<br>
Oh, great God<br>
Oh, great God.<br>
Then doth my soul burst forth in song of praise<br>
Oh, great God<br>
Oh, great God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
O mighty God, when I survey in wonder<br>
The world that formed when once the word you said,<br>
The strands of life all woven close together,<br>
The whole creation at your table fed,<br>
<br>
<br>

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,<br>
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;<br>
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,<br>
He bled and died to take away my sin:<br>
<br>
<br>
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee:<br>
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!<br>

And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!<br>
<br>

2 Chronicles 20: 12-26 NLT<br>
12 O our God, won't you stop them? We are powerless against this mighty army that is about to attack us. We do not know what to do, but we are looking to you for help."<br>
13 As all the men of Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones, wives, and children, <br>
14 the Spirit of the Lord came upon one of the men standing there. His name was Jahaziel son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite who was a descendant of Asaph.<br>
15 He said, "Listen, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Listen, King Jehoshaphat! This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid! Don't be discouraged by this mighty army, for the battle is not yours, but God's.<br>
16 Tomorrow, march out against them. You will find them coming up through the ascent of Ziz at the end of the valley that opens into the wilderness of Jeruel.<br>
17 But you will not even need to fight. Take your positions; then stand still and watch the Lord's victory. He is with you, O people of Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid or discouraged. Go out against them tomorrow, for the Lord is with you!"<br>
18 Then King Jehoshaphat bowed low with his face to the ground. And all the people of Judah and Jerusalem did the same, worshiping the Lord.<br>
19 Then the Levites from the clans of Kohath and Korah stood to praise the Lord, the God of Israel, with a very loud shout.<br>
20 Early the next morning the army of Judah went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. On the way Jehoshaphat stopped and said, "Listen to me, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be able to stand firm. Believe in his prophets, and you will succeed."<br>
21 After consulting the people, the king appointed singers to walk ahead of the army, singing to the Lord and praising him for his holy splendour. This is what they sang:<br>
"Give thanks to the Lord;<br>
his faithful love endures forever!"<br>
<br>
Again, KJV of verse 21:<br>
21 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that (praisers) should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
22 At the very moment they began to sing and give praise, the Lord caused the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir to start fighting among themselves.<br>
23 The armies of Moab and Ammon turned against their allies from Mount Seir and killed every one of them. After they had destroyed the army of Seir, they began attacking each other.<br>
24 So when the army of Judah arrived at the lookout point in the wilderness, all they saw were dead bodies lying on the ground as far as they could see. Not a single one of the enemy had escaped.<br>
25 King Jehoshaphat and his men went out to gather the plunder. (They found vast amounts of corpses,) They found vast amounts of equipment, clothing, and other valuables -- more than they could carry. There was so much plunder that it took them three days just to collect it all!<br>
26 On the fourth day they gathered in the Valley of Blessing, (which, in Hebrew, would be known as the valley of Beracah,) which got its name that day because the people praised and thanked the Lord there. It is still called the Valley of Blessing today.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 61:3 (KJV)<br>
To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 61:3 NLT<br>
To all who mourn in Israel, (in Zion,)<br>
he will give a crown of beauty for ashes,<br>
a joyous blessing instead of mourning,<br>
festive praise instead of despair.<br>
In their righteousness, they will be like great oaks<br>
that the Lord has planted for his own glory.<br>

The Proverbs 31 Woman -- A Wife of Noble Character<br>
From The Sayings of King Lemuel<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 31: 9-31 KJV<br>
9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.<br>
10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.<br>
11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.<br>
12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.<br>
13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.<br>
14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.<br>
15 She riseth also whilst it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.<br>
<br>
<br>
16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it (and taketh it): with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.<br>
<br>
<br>
17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.<br>
<br>
(She tasteth that her merchandise is good)<br>
18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.<br>
<br>
<br>
19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.<br>
<br>
(She spreadeth out her hand to the poor)<br>
20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.<br>
<br>
<br>
21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.<br>
(For all her household are clothed with double garments.)<br>
<br>
22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.<br>
23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.<br>
24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.<br>
25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.<br>
26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.<br>
27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.<br>
28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.<br>
<br>
(Many daughters have gotten riches, but thou excellest them all.)<br>
29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.<br>
<br>
<br>
30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.<br>
31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.<br>
<br>
Verses 10-31 talk about the Proverbs 31 Woman.<br>
<br>
Did you know that the Proverbs 31 Woman is a Hebrew acrostic poem?<br>
Each verse, starting in verse 10, begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 31: 8-31 NLT<br>
8<br>
Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves;<br>
ensure justice for those being crushed.<br>
9<br>
Yes, speak up for the poor and helpless,<br>
and see that they get justice.<br>
10<br>
Who can find a virtuous and capable wife?<br>
She is more precious than rubies.<br>
11<br>
Her husband can trust her,<br>
and she will greatly enrich his life.<br>
12<br>
She brings him good, not harm,<br>
all the days of her life.<br>
13<br>
She finds wool and flax<br>
and busily spins it.<br>
14<br>
She is like a merchant's ship,<br>
bringing her food from afar.<br>
15<br>
She gets up before dawn to prepare breakfast for her household<br>
and plan the day's work for her servant girls.<br>
16<br>
She goes to inspect a field and buys it;<br>
with her earnings she plants a vineyard.<br>
17<br>
She is energetic and strong,<br>
a hard worker.<br>
18<br>
She makes sure her dealings are profitable;<br>
her lamp burns late into the night.<br>
19<br>
Her hands are busy spinning thread,<br>
her fingers twisting fibre.<br>
20<br>
She extends a helping hand to the poor<br>
and opens her arms to the needy.<br>
<br>
<br>
21<br>
She has no fear of winter for her household,<br>
for everyone has warm clothes.<br>
(for everyone has scarlet.)<br>
<br>
22<br>
She makes her own bedspreads.<br>
She dresses in fine linen and purple gowns.<br>
23<br>
Her husband is well known at the city gates,<br>
where he sits with the other civic leaders.<br>
24<br>
She makes belted linen garments<br>
and sashes to sell to the merchants.<br>
25<br>
She is clothed with strength and dignity,<br>
and she laughs without fear of the future.<br>
26<br>
When she speaks, her words are wise,<br>
and she gives instructions with kindness.<br>
27<br>
She carefully watches everything in her household<br>
and suffers nothing from laziness.<br>
28<br>
Her children stand and bless her.<br>
Her husband praises her:<br>
29<br>
"There are many virtuous and capable women in the world,<br>
but you surpass them all!"<br>
30<br>
Charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last;<br>
but a woman who fears the Lord will be greatly praised.<br>
31<br>
Reward her for all she has done.<br>
Let her deeds publicly declare her praise.<br>

<br>
Let's give an example of what can happen when you go deeper into a Bible study.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Not very long ago, we took a quick look at Bible verses that are typically thought of as, telling us to be fasting.<br>
<br>
In that Bible study, we mentioned that,<br>
In the KJV, to fast is, to afflict your souls.<br>
Fasting was translated into, afflict your souls, in the KJV.<br>
<br>
Now let's think about this again, and go deeper.<br>
<br>
The Day of Atonement, celebrated today as Yom Kippur, is a day when you are supposed to fast.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Why is this one of the seven feasts?<br>
<br>
I have always thought of a feast as being a pleasurable abundance of a large, rich and very good meal where a lot of people celebrate a special occasion.<br>
<br>
It could also refer to a regularly occurring celebration commemorating a person or event, not necessarily with food involved.<br>
<br>
But, the first thing I think of, is, that, at a feast, there is food, and lots of it.<br>
<br>
So, why would we call The Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, a day of fasting, when it is called a feast?<br>
<br>
There's only one way to search this out.  Go deeper.<br>
<br>
Let's target those verses again that we looked at before.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word or words were translated into English in these three verses.<br>
<br>
Numbers 29:7 (KJV)<br>
afflict your souls<br>
<br>
Leviticus 16:29 (KJV)<br>
afflict your souls<br>
<br>
Leviticus 16:31 (KJV)<br>
afflict your souls<br>
<br>
The actual Hebrew word being used, for, afflict, is pronounced as follows...<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 29:7 (KJV)<br>
afflict -- That Hebrew word is pronounced, Aw-Nah<br>
<br>
Leviticus 16:29 (KJV)<br>
afflict -- That word is also, Aw-Nah<br>
<br>
Leviticus 16:31 (KJV)<br>
afflict -- same word here too, Aw-Nah.<br>
<br>
So, let's find out what that word means.<br>
As mentioned previously,<br>
we will look up that word in the<br>
Strong's Hebrew Lexicon, and<br>
The Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions.<br>
We will also use those same books again later on.<br>
<br>
And so, Aw-Nah, means,<br>
looking down or browbeating; <br>
to depress<br>
to be occupied, be busied with<br>
to afflict, oppress, humble, be afflicted, be bowed down<br>
to be put down, become low<br>
to be depressed, be downcast<br>
to be afflicted<br>
to stoop<br>
to humble oneself, bow down<br>
to be afflicted, be humbled<br>
to humble, weaken oneself<br>
<br>
That's it. Those are the definitions.<br>
The word, fasting, is not mentioned.<br>
Now, fasting would certainly be a way to humble yourself.<br>
But, technically, the Bible does not say exactly that fasting is a requirement.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
This is a game changer. This means that you have the freedom to humble yourself as the Lord leads you and directs you.  Yes, fasting is a good and useful tool, and if the Lord directs you to fast as one of the ways to humble yourself, that is certainly a good thing to do.  In a moment, we will look at several places where people were in a situation and were lead to pray and fast about their predicament. In fact, one verse that we will read here in a moment is Psalms 35:13 (KJV) where it says, " I humbled my soul with fasting...."<br>
<br>
So, with this knowledge, we can now say that, The Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, is definitely a day to humble yourself, and bring yourself down low in some way, but it does not have to be exactly and only fasting.  We can fast, or we can choose not to fast, but we do have the freedom to ask the Lord how He would like for us to humble ourselves, be it with or without fasting.<br>
<br>
So, if I was to use my imagination, and try to think of ways to humble myself, yes, I could fast, but I could also humble myself in many other ways.  Put on some clothes in the dirty laundry basket and wear them again, and then walk to a place that serves free meals or lunches for those in need.  In London, for example, there are 70, 80 or even well above 90 places around the Greater London area serving free meals.  A few of them will even sit you down at a nice table, and serve the meal to you, as though you were seated at a nice restaurant, except that the meal they serve you is free.  Sometimes, those meals may be fairly decent, but many of them do come from surplus food sources, and may consist of expired, processed, low-quality foods that contain sugar, carbs and gluten.  When you're financially struggling, you may not have very many diet choices available. So, turn off and do not touch the phone, TV and computer, leave your car at home, avoid taking public transportation, and walk to a place that serves free meals.  Eat what they serve, unless it is a non-food item like pork or ham, and hang around the people that are eating there too.  Look at their clothing, and look at the expressions on their faces. Jesus knew the Bible better than you, and yet He made the decision to hang around people like that, people like you, because He loved them with an everlasting love, and gave his life as a ransom for them and for you.<br>
<br>
That was only an example.  Different people may be led in different ways on how they should humble themselves.  It may look different for you, depending on your area of the world, and your personal life and situation.<br>
<br>
Now we know that The Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur, is a day to humble yourself, and it does not have to be fasting at all, or it could be just fasting and nothing else.  How, do you think, the Lord would direct you to humble yourself?<br>
<br>
As we have said earlier, there are several examples in the Bible where people were led to pray and fast.  Let's take a look at these verses...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 20: 1-4 KJV<br>
1 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.<br>
2 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazon-tamar, which is En-gedi.<br>
3 And Jehoshaphat feared, (and set his face to seek the Lord,) and set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.<br>
4 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the Lord: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 20: 1-4 NLT<br>
1 After this, the armies of the Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites declared war on Jehoshaphat.<br>
2 Messengers came and told Jehoshaphat, "A vast army from Edom (from Aram) is marching against you from beyond (the sea,) the Dead Sea. They are already at Hazazon-tamar." (This was another name for En-gedi.)<br>
3 Jehoshaphat was terrified by this news and begged the Lord for guidance. He also ordered everyone in Judah to begin fasting.<br>
4 So people from all the towns of Judah came to Jerusalem to seek the Lord's help.<br>
<br>
That is the beginning of the story that we recently looked at, where all they had to do was sing and give praise.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 20: verses 22 and 24 NLT<br>
22 At the very moment they began to sing and give praise, the Lord caused the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir to start fighting among themselves.<br>
24 So when the army of Judah arrived at the lookout point in the wilderness, all they saw were dead bodies lying on the ground as far as they could see. Not a single one of the enemy had escaped.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 10:30 (KJV)<br>
And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,<br>
<br>
This is the story where Peter Visits Cornelius.<br>
<br>
Acts 10: 28-35 NLT<br>
<br>
28 Peter told them, "You know it is against our laws for a Jewish man to enter a Gentile home like this or to associate with you. But God has shown me that I should no longer think of anyone as impure or unclean.<br>
29 So I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. Now tell me why you sent for me."<br>
30 Cornelius replied, "Four days ago I was praying in my house about this same time, three o'clock in the afternoon. Suddenly, a man in dazzling clothes was standing in front of me.<br>
31 He told me, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your gifts to the poor have been noticed by God!<br>
32 Now send messengers to Joppa, and summon a man named Simon Peter. He is staying in the home of Simon, a tanner who lives near the seashore.'<br>
33 So I sent for you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here, waiting before God to hear the message the Lord has given you."<br>
34 Then Peter replied, "I see very clearly that God shows no favouritism.<br>
35 In every nation he accepts those who fear him and do what is right.<br>
<br>
Acts 10: 34 & 35 KJV<br>
34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:<br>
35 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 13: 2 & 3 (KJV)<br>
2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.<br>
3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 13: 1-3 NLT<br>
1 Among the prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch of Syria were Barnabas, Simeon (who was called Niger, "the black man"), Lucius (from Cyrene), Manaen (the childhood companion of King Herod Antipas, the tetrarch), and Saul.<br>
2 One day as these men were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Appoint Barnabas and Saul for the special work to which I have called them."<br>
3 So after more fasting and prayer, the men laid their hands on them and sent them on their way.<br>
<br>
(By the way, Niger is a large country in West Africa, south of Algeria and north of Nigeria. Much of the land is desert.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 14:23 (KJV)<br>
And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 14: 21-24 NLT<br>
21 After preaching the Good News in Derbe and making many disciples, Paul and Barnabas returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch of Pisidia,<br>
22 where they strengthened the believers. They encouraged them to continue in the faith, reminding them that we must suffer many hardships to enter the Kingdom of God.<br>
23 Paul and Barnabas also appointed elders in every church. With prayer and fasting, they turned the elders over to the care of the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.<br>
24 Then they travelled back through Pisidia to Pamphylia.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 1:4 (KJV)<br>
And it came to pass, when I (Nehemiah,) heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 1: 2-4 (NLT)<br>
2 Hanani, one of my brothers, came to visit me with some other men who had just arrived from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had returned there from captivity and about how things were going in Jerusalem.<br>
3 They said to me, "Things are not going well for those who returned to the province of Judah. They are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem has been torn down, and the gates have been destroyed by fire."<br>
4 When I heard this, I sat down and wept. In fact, for days I mourned, fasted, and prayed to the God of heaven.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah, chapters 8 and 9 NLT<br>
Ezra Reads the Law, and they celebrate The Festival of Shelters, and then The People Confess Their Sins.<br>
<br>
Nehemiah, chapter 8, starting in verse 17, and we keep reading until we get to chapter 9, verse 3.<br>
<br>
17 So everyone who had returned from captivity lived in these shelters during the festival, and they were all filled with great joy! The Israelites had not celebrated like this since the days of Joshua (since the days of Jeshua,) son of Nun.<br>
18 Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God on each of the seven days of the festival. Then on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, as was required by law.<br>
1 On 31 October 445 BC, the people assembled again, and this time they fasted and dressed in burlap and sprinkled dust on their heads.<br>
2 Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners as they confessed their own sins and the sins of their ancestors.<br>
3 They remained standing in place for three hours (a quarter of a day,) whilst the Book of the Law of the Lord their God was read aloud to them. Then for three more hours they confessed their sins and worshiped the Lord their God.<br>
<br>
<br>
This date, 31 October 445 BC, was on the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar.<br>
<br>
We were targeting the verse that mentioned fasting...<br>
Nehemiah 9:1 (KJV)<br>
Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezra's Journey to Jerusalem...<br>
<br>
Ezra 8:21-23 (KJV)<br>
21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.<br>
22 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.<br>
23 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezra 8:21-23 (NLT)<br>
21 And there by the Ahava Canal, I gave orders for all of us to fast and humble ourselves before our God. We prayed that he would give us a safe journey and protect us, our children, and our goods as we travelled.<br>
22 For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen (also known as charioteers) to accompany us and protect us from enemies along the way. After all, we had told the king, "Our God's hand of protection is on all who worship him, but his fierce anger rages against those who abandon him."<br>
23 So we fasted and earnestly prayed that our God would take care of us, and he heard our prayer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 5:33-35 (NLT)<br>
33 One day some people said to Jesus, "John the Baptist's disciples fast and pray regularly, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees. Why are your disciples always eating and drinking?"<br>
34 Jesus responded, "Do wedding guests fast whilst celebrating with the groom? Of course not.<br>
35 But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We looked at these next two verses before, when we did the Bible study on Moses and Esther, back in Christian Essays 4.<br>
Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy, and the disciples did not understand why they could not cast out that particular demon when they tried to do so earlier.<br>
<br>
Matthew 17:21 (KJV)<br>
Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.<br>
<br>
Mark 9:29 (KJV)<br>
And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 35:13 (KJV)<br>
But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word there, for fasting, is pronounced, Soam.<br>
He used the same word we saw earlier, and then tells us he did that specifically by fasting.<br>
I humbled my soul with fasting;<br>
I Aw-Nah my soul with Soam;<br>
<br>
Soam, means,<br>
a fast<br>
fast, fasting<br>
<br>
Soam is absolutely absent and nowhere to be found in all of Leviticus, chapter 16.<br>
and it also is 100% non-existent in all of Numbers, chapter 29.<br>
<br>
Psalms 35: 11-15 NLT<br>
11<br>
Malicious witnesses testify against me.<br>
They accuse me of crimes I know nothing about.<br>
12<br>
They repay me evil for good.<br>
I am sick with despair.<br>
13<br>
Yet when they were ill, I grieved for them.<br>
I denied myself by fasting for them,<br>
but my prayers returned unanswered.<br>
14<br>
I was sad, as though they were my friends or family,<br>
as if I were grieving for my own mother.<br>
15<br>
But they are glad now that I am in trouble;<br>
they gleefully join together against me.<br>
I am attacked by people I don't even know;<br>
they slander me constantly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Verse 15 points to social media, many centuries before it existed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 9:3 (KJV)<br>
And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 2:37 (KJV)<br>
And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 2: 36-38 NLT<br>
36 Anna, a prophet, was also there in the Temple. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. Her husband died when they had been married only seven years.<br>
37 Then she lived as a widow to the age of eighty-four (or it could be that she had been a widow for eighty-four years). She never left the Temple but stayed there day and night, worshiping God with fasting and prayer.<br>
38 She came along just as Simeon was talking with Mary and Joseph, and she began praising God. She talked about the child to everyone who had been waiting expectantly for God to rescue Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
This next verse was just a suggestion, and not a commandment.<br>
Giving Instruction on Marriage to husbands and wives.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 7:5 (KJV)<br>
Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 7: 5 & 6 NLT<br>
5 (The husband and wife should not) deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.<br>
6 I say this as a concession, not as a command.<br>
<br>
The fasting part in the KJV did not seem to find its way as clearly when going into the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: If you choose not to fast, and someone does not seem to agree with that, what do you do?<br>
<br>
Colossians 2:16 (KJV)<br>
Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:<br>
<br>
Colossians 2: 16 & 17 NLT<br>
16 So don't let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths.<br>
17 For these rules are only shadows of the reality yet to come. And Christ himself is that reality.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3: 18-21 NLT<br>
18<br>
Stop deceiving yourselves. If you think you are wise by this world's standards, you need to become a fool to be truly wise.<br>
19<br>
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. As the Scriptures say,<br>
"He traps the wise<br>
in the snare of their own cleverness." (Job 5:13)<br>
20<br>
And again,<br>
"The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise;<br>
he knows they are worthless."(Psalms 94:11)<br>
21<br>
So don't boast about following a particular human leader. For everything belongs to you....<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3:23 NLT<br>
...Everything belongs to you, and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3:21 (KJV)<br>
Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 2:15 (KJV)<br>
These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 2:14 & 15 NLT<br>
14 He gave his life to free us from every kind of sin, to cleanse us, and to make us his very own people, totally committed to doing good deeds.<br>
15 You must teach these things and encourage the believers to do them. You have the authority to correct them when necessary, so don't let anyone disregard what you say.<br>
<br>

<br>
Hosea 4:4 (KJV)<br>
Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 4: verses 1-4, and then verses 6 through 12. NLT<br>
1<br>
Hear the word of the Lord, O people of Israel!<br>
The Lord has brought charges against you, saying:<br>
"There is no faithfulness, no kindness,<br>
no knowledge of God in your land.<br>
2<br>
You make vows and break them;<br>
you kill and steal and commit adultery.<br>
There is violence everywhere -- <br>
one murder after another.<br>
3<br>
That is why your land is in mourning,<br>
and everyone is wasting away.<br>
Even the wild animals, the birds of the sky,<br>
and the fish of the sea are disappearing.<br>
4<br>
"Don't point your finger at someone else<br>
and try to pass the blame!<br>
My complaint, you priests,<br>
is with you.<br>
<br>
(Your people are like those with a complaint against the priests.)<br>
<br>
<br>
6<br>
My people are being destroyed<br>
because they don't know me.<br>
Since you priests refuse to know me,<br>
I refuse to recognise you as my priests.<br>
Since you have forgotten the laws of your God,<br>
I will forget to bless your children.<br>
7<br>
The more priests there are,<br>
the more they sin against me.<br>
They have exchanged the glory of God<br>
for the shame of idols.<br>
<br>
(I will turn their glory into shame.)<br>
<br>
<br>
8<br>
"When the people bring their sin offerings, the priests get fed.<br>
So the priests are glad when the people sin!<br>
9<br>
'And what the priests do, the people also do.'<br>
So now I will punish both priests and people<br>
for their wicked deeds.<br>
10<br>
They will eat and still be hungry.<br>
They will play the prostitute and gain nothing from it,<br>
for they have deserted the Lord<br>
11<br>
to worship other gods.<br>
"Wine has robbed my people<br>
of their understanding.<br>
12<br>
They ask a piece of wood for advice!<br>
They think a stick can tell them the future!<br>
Longing after idols<br>
has made them foolish.<br>
They have played the prostitute,<br>
serving other gods and deserting their God.<br>

John 8: 12-19 NLT<br>
12 Jesus spoke to the people once more and said, "I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won't have to walk in darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life."<br>
13 The Pharisees replied, "You are making those claims about yourself! Such testimony is not valid."<br>
14 Jesus told them, "These claims are valid even though I make them about myself. For I know where I came from and where I am going, but you don't know this about me.<br>
15 You judge me by human standards, but I do not judge anyone.<br>
16 And if I did, my judgement would be correct in every respect because I am not alone. (The One who sent me,) The Father who sent me is with me.<br>
17 Your own law says that if two people agree about something, their witness is accepted as fact (referring to Deut 19:15).<br>
18 I am one witness, and my Father who sent me is the other."<br>
19 "Where is your father?" they asked.<br>
Jesus answered, "Since you don't know who I am, you don't know who my Father is. If you knew me, you would also know my Father."<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 16:29 (KJV)<br>
See, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 16: 28 & 29 NLT<br>
28 The Lord asked Moses, "How long will these people refuse to obey my commands and instructions?<br>
29 They must realise that the Sabbath is the Lord's gift to you. That is why he gives you a two-day supply on the sixth day, so there will be enough for two days. On the Sabbath day you must each stay in your place. Do not go out to pick up food on the seventh day."<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 16:29 NIV -- New International Version (NIV) (1978)<br>
Bear in mind that the Lord has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day; no one is to go out."<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 16:29 -- New American Standard Bible (NASB) (1995)<br>
See, the Lord has given you the sabbath; therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Remain every man in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."<br>

Romans 14:13 (KJV)<br>
Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.<br>
<br>
Romans 14:13 NLT<br>
So let's stop condemning each other. Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 5:22 (KJV)<br>
For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement unto the Son:<br>
<br>
<br>
John 5: 14-30 NLT<br>
14...Jesus found him in the Temple and told him, "Now you are well; so stop sinning, or something even worse may happen to you."<br>
15 Then the man went and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had healed him.<br>
16 So the Jewish leaders began (persecuting and) harassing Jesus for breaking the Sabbath rules.<br>
17 But Jesus replied, "My Father is always working, and so am I."<br>
18 So the Jewish leaders tried all the harder to find a way to kill him. For he not only broke the Sabbath, he called God his Father, thereby making himself equal with God.<br>
19 So Jesus explained, "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.<br>
20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. In fact, the Father will show him how to do even greater works than healing this man. Then you will truly be astonished.<br>
21 For just as the Father gives life to those he raises from the dead, so the Son gives life to anyone he wants.<br>
22 In addition, the Father judges no one. Instead, he has given the Son absolute authority to judge,<br>
23 so that everyone will honour the Son, just as they honour the Father. Anyone who does not honour the Son is certainly not honouring the Father who sent him.<br>
24 "I tell you the truth, those who listen to my message and believe in God who sent me have eternal life. They will never be condemned for their sins, but they have already passed from death into life.<br>
25 "And I assure you that the time is coming, indeed it's here now, when the dead will hear my voice -- the voice of the Son of God. And those who listen will live.<br>
26 The Father has life in himself, and he has granted that same life-giving power to his Son.<br>
27 And he has given him authority to judge everyone because he is the Son of Man.<br>
(The "Son of Man" is a title that Jesus used for himself.)<br>
28 Don't be so surprised! Indeed, the time is coming when all the dead in their graves will hear the voice of God's Son,<br>
29 and they will rise again. Those who have done good will rise to experience eternal life, and those who have continued in evil will rise to experience judgement.<br>
30 I can do nothing on my own. I judge as God tells me. Therefore, my judgement is just, because I carry out the will of the one who sent me, not my own will.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 10:30 (KJV)<br>
I and my Father are one.<br>
<br>
John 10:27-30 KJV<br>
27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:<br>
28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.<br>
29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.<br>
30 I and my Father are one.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 10:27-30 NLT<br>
27 My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. <br>
28 I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me,<br>
29 for my Father has given them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else. No one can snatch them from the Father's hand.<br>
<br>
(for what my Father has given me is more powerful than anything. No one can snatch them from the Father's hand.)<br>
<br>
(for regarding that which my Father has given me, he is greater than all. No one can snatch them from the Father's hand.)<br>
<br>
<br>
30 The Father and I are one."<br>

The Death of Jesus<br>
John 19:34 (KJV)<br>
But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 5:7 (KJV)<br>
For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 5: 6-8 NLT:<br>
<br>
(This is he who came by water and blood. -- not by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit, who is truth, confirms it with his testimony.)<br>
<br>
6 And Jesus Christ was revealed as God's Son by his baptism in water and by shedding his blood on the cross<br>
7 So we have these three witnesses<br>
8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood -- and all three agree.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Some have argued that this area of Scripture was modified in later years to read as follows...<br>
<br>
(So we have these three witnesses in heaven -- the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one. And we have three witnesses on earth. -- the Spirit, the water, and the blood -- and all three agree.)<br>
<br>
As a result, most people do agree about the Spirit-water-blood trinity, but may question or argue against the Father - Word - Holy Spirit trinity.<br>
Maybe they point their fingers at the Catholics for adding this?<br>
If I ask you to come here, I don't need to tell you to bring your head and neck and arms and legs along with you.<br>
God, the Lord, will draw near to you if you ask him to, and he will bring all of his parts with him, be it a trinity this, or a seven-fold spirit of that.<br>
When you call the repairman to come to your house, he's smart enough to bring all of his tools with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 17:11 (KJV)<br>
...Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.<br>
<br>
John 17: 9-12 KJV<br>
Jesus is praying to his Father in Heaven...<br>
9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.<br>
10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.<br>
11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.<br>
12 Whilst I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 17: 9-12 NLT<br>
Jesus is praying to his Father in Heaven, which is also our Father in Heaven...<br>
9 "My prayer is not for the world, but for those you have given me, because they belong to you.<br>
10 All who are mine belong to you, and you have given them to me, so they bring me glory.<br>
11 Now I am departing from the world; they are staying in this world, but I am coming to you. Holy Father, you have given me your name, (you have given me these, and you have given me these disciples). now protect them by the power of your name so that they will be united just as we are.<br>
12 During my time here, I protected them by the power of the name you gave me.<br>
<br>
<br>
The actual, true name of our Holy Lord, Heavenly Father is<br>
The Father (Yaw Who Wah)<br>
The son, Messiah, Jesus Christ is (Yah Who Shaw)<br>
The Holy Spirit is (Hawk Oh Desh, Roo awkK)<br>
The Spirit that is Holy is (Roo awkK, Hawk Oh Desh) (it is usually said this backwards way in Hebrew.)<br>
The Hebrew for our Master, The Lord (God) Jesus is (ELL-Low-Heem) (Yah Who Shaw)<br>
Other variations of Jesus include, Yes-Shoe-Uh, and, Yea-SHOO-Uh, which may also be generally accurate.<br>
If you make all of those sounds come out of your mouth, I'm confident that He knows that you're talking to Him.<br>
And, I think everyone still knows who you are praying to when you pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>

Let's go back now, and finish up our look at the places in the Bible where people did Prayer and Fasting, by remembering the story of Esther,<br>
in the part of the story in Chapter 4, when Mordecai finds out about Haman's Plot against the Jews, Mordecai Requests Esther's Help.<br>
<br>
Esther 4:3 (KJV)<br>
And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.<br>
<br>
Esther 4:3 -- NLT<br>
3 And as news of the king's decree reached all the provinces, there was great mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, and wailed, and many people lay in burlap and ashes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Esther 4: 13-17 NLT<br>
13 Mordecai sent this reply to Esther: "Don't think for a moment that because you're in the palace you will escape when all other Jews are killed.<br>
14 If you keep quiet at a time like this, deliverance and relief for the Jews will arise from some other place, but you and your relatives will die. Who knows if perhaps you were made queen for just such a time as this?"<br>
15 Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:<br>
16 "Go and gather together all the Jews of Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will do the same. And then, though it is against the law, I will go in to see the king. If I must die, I must die."<br>
17 So Mordecai went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.<br>
<br>
Esther 4:16 (KJV) The part where we saw fasting, was when Esther says to Mordecai:<br>
Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.<br>
<br>
<br>
And that is the end of our deeper look at fasting in the Scriptures.<br>
<br>
By the way, there is a really cool Bible study hiding there in<br>
Esther 4:14 KJV<br>
<br>
(For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there respiration and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place;)<br>
<br>
14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?<br>
<br>
Commentary: Where you are, this time and season that you are in, the place and situation that you are in, God could use someone else if need be, but maybe he's calling you.  Only God knows if perhaps he has a good and perfect plan to place you where you are for just such a time as this? Are there people in your life that you can love on and minister to because they just so happen to be in your life at such a time as this?<br>
Don't look back, just look around, then look up. -- Old people that cannot get around much anymore -- children in unstable or abusive situations -- if you're not quite sure what to do, at least lift them up in prayer.<br>

<br>
Deleted Verses<br>
<br>
<br>
There are some Bible verses in the KJV that some argue as being added later, and were not originally a part of the original New Testament.<br>
Because there is some evidence to support this,<br>
I thought it might be interesting to take a very short and fast look at these verses and include a short remark about each verse.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many websites do go into a detailed analysis as to the history and explanations as to why they were added to the KJV, but then deleted from recent English translations.<br>
For example, some may have been added by Catholics to help support Catholic perspectives.<br>
<br>
<br>
One site that did a great job of being complete and yet not exceptionally wordy, was Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia.<br>
The Wikipedia webpage that we looked at back in October 2019, was titled, List of New Testament verses not included in modern English translations.<br>
The webpage that we will be skimming through today was located here...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_Testament_verses_not_included_in_modern_English_translations">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_Testament_verses_not_included_in_modern_English_translations</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The KJV still has to this day all of these verses.<br>
The NLT, however, recognises that these verses were not originally there, and has removed them from the main Biblical text in their translation.<br>
The NLT then includes a footnote that includes the deleted verse, and explains that it was not originally in the Bible, but was added later, in some "very late manuscripts."<br>
<br>
This footnote information, if interesting and helpful, is mentioned in our Bible studies, placed within round brackets.<br>
When you hear a verse being read two times, but the repeated verse sounds a little bit different, that is likely the additional verse.<br>
We also do this to help bring out the original meanings, and alternative meanings of the original languages.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Using the list published by Wikipedia, from the webpage that we mentioned earlier, let's take a quick look at each verse, and say a very short remark about each one.<br>
<br>
<br>
The following 25 verses were removed from the main text of the Bible, and are typically placed into a footnote.<br>
<br>
<br>
25 Deleted Verses:<br>
<br>
Matthew 17:21 -- this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting -- It is believed to have been assimilated from Mark.<br>
<br>
Matthew 18:11 -- Son of man is come to save that which was lost. -- not in original handwriting, manifestly borrowed by copyists from Luke 19:10<br>
<br>
Matthew 23:14 -- hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer -- very similar to, and derived from the parallel in Mark 12:40 and Luke 20:47<br>
<br>
Mark 7:16 -- If any man have ears to hear, -- it is missing in the very oldest resources and yet is identical to verses that remain. -- repeated by a copyist<br>
<br>
Mark 9:44 & 9:46 -- worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched -- verses 44 and 46 are duplicates of verse 48, which remains in the text.<br>
<br>
Mark 11:26 -- But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father -- missing from 'most' Greek manuscripts<br>
<br>
Mark 15:28 -- scripture was fulfilled, which saith, "And he was numbered with the transgressors." -- similar to Luke 22:37. It does not appear here in any New Testament manuscript prior to the end of the 6th century.<br>
<br>
Luke 17:36 -- Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. -- absent in most of the Greek copies. -- missing from Tyndale's version (1534) and the Geneva Bible (1557).<br>
<br>
John 5:3-4 -- an Angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was (healed) -- Strong evidence proves that these words clearly were not in the original text.<br>
<br>
Acts 8:37 -- If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest." And he [the Eunuch] answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God -- majority of Greek manuscripts copied after 600 AD and the majority of translations made after 600 AD do not include the verse<br>
<br>
Acts 15:34 -- Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. -- does not appear in the oldest manuscripts, and the manuscripts that do contain it are inconsistent about its text.<br>
<br>
Acts 24:6-8 -- would have judged according to our law. But the chief captain, Lysias, came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands, Commanding his accusers to come unto thee -- These words are not found in the oldest sources.<br>
<br>
Acts 28:29 -- when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning [arguing] among themselves. -- This verse is not found in the oldest sources, not found in several of the oldest manuscripts<br>
<br>
Romans 16:24 -- The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. -- Absent from the oldest sources and there is confusion or disagreement about its appearance in several of the sources containing it.<br>
<br>
1 John 5:7-8 -- For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost, and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth -- not in the original Greek manuscripts<br>
<br>
Matthew 20:16 -- for many be called, but few chosen. -- not right here in the original Greek manuscripts -- The same words appear in Matthew 22:14 -- quote it from there instead<br>
<br>
Mark 6:11 -- Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgement, than for that city -- not right here in the original Greek manuscripts -- instead, quote it from Matthew 10:15 where it is originally found<br>
<br>
Luke 4:8 -- Get thee behind me, Satan, -- those words are not originally found here, but they are used in a different situation in Matthew 16:23 and Mark 8:33, and in the KJV, there is a similar phrase, "Get thee hence, Satan," in Matthew 4:10<br>
<br>
Luke 9:55-56 -- and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. --  not in the very early Greek manuscripts, but is found in most Latin manuscripts<br>
<br>
Luke 23:17 -- For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast. (At every Passover Festival Pilate had to set free one prisoner for them.) -- Not found here, because it was never a requirement or law -- such requirement or law never actually existed, but the similar verses at Matthew 27:15 and Mark 15:6, indicate that, releasing a prisoner on Passover is a "habit" or "custom" of Pilate, and at John 18:39 is a custom of the Jews.<br>
<br>
Acts 9:5-6 -- it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.' And he, trembling and astonished, said, 'Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?' And the Lord said unto him -- not found in any of the early Greek manuscripts<br>
<br>
Acts 13:42 -- the Jews were gone out of the Synagogue, the Gentiles besought -- the original Greek text only says, they -- as they went out, they besought -- it only reads, they -- also, other translations may choose to insert the following, which is also not true and not found here, which would be, Paul and Barnabas going out and 'the people'<br>
<br>
Acts 23:9 -- Let us not fight against God. -- does not appear here in the earliest and best resources -- it is in Acts 5:39 -- quote it instead from there<br>
<br>
Mark 16:9-20 -- known as the longer ending, starts with, Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, and, 11 more verses later, ends with, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen. -- Some original Greek manuscripts had it, and many did not -- most agree that the book of Mark ended at chapter 16, verse 8.<br>
<br>
John 7:53-8:11 -- starts with, And every man went unto his own house. Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives;, it tells the story of the adulteress saved by Jesus, and ends with, She said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go, and sin no more."  -- Many original Greek manuscripts had it, and some did not -- many arguments on if it was originally there, and there are arguments on its exact wording and location in the book -- although it appears in many ancient manuscripts, it does not consistently appear in this place, and there are at least three known variations of the wording.<br>
<br>
<br>
And there is one verse that never existed, but is being added into recent translations, and it is not true.<br>
Mark 7:19 <br>
The NIV, and other modern translations have invented and inserted an additional sentence at the end that says:<br>
In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.<br>
This additional sentence is not in the Geneva Bible, and it is not in the KJV. Why is it not in the KJV?<br>
Because it does not exist in any of the Greek manuscripts.<br>
It was most likely added in the year 1978, by the translators working for the NIV.<br>
Other newer translations have also added it. It is in the NLT.<br>
It was not originally in the Bible, and it is wrong for the NIV and NLT to have this extra sentence added, because that sentence is not actually in the Bible.<br>
<br>
Because this extra sentence is not actually a verse in the Bible, it is not true.<br>
It is in direct opposition to other verses, and it is in direct opposition to what the Bible teaches.<br>
<br>
We provided additional details about Mark 7:19 in the Bible Study, titled, Blood, in Christian Essays 10.<br>

John 12:26 KJV<br>
If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 12:26 NLT<br>
Anyone who wants to serve me must follow me, because my servants must be where I am. And the Father will honour anyone who serves me.<br>
<br>
<br>
I Have Decided to Follow Jesus, is a Christian hymn that originated in Assam, India.<br>
It is based on the final words of a Christian man, in Assam, in the middle of the 19th Century through the efforts of an American Baptist missionary.<br>
They were the Indian words he spoke as his children, then his wife, then himself were killed for believing and following Jesus.<br>
Those final words were turned into a hymn by Indian missionary, Sadhu Sundar Singh.<br>
Sadhu Sundar Singh was born in 1889, and died in 1929.<br>
No one knows when Sadhu Sundar Singh wrote the words for, I Have Decided to Follow Jesus.<br>
Perhaps, sometime between 1909 to 1927? No one really knows.<br>
An American hymn editor, William Jensen Reynolds, composed an arrangement which was included in the 1959 Assembly Songbook. His version became a regular feature of Billy Graham's evangelistic meetings in America and elsewhere, spreading its popularity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the song,<br>
I Have Decided to Follow Jesus,<br>
by Sadhu Sundar Singh.<br>
<br>
I have decided to follow Jesus;<br>

Lord Jesus, I feel stuck. I don't know how to get unstuck.<br>
I want to go to where Better is, I want to go to where I fit in, to where I belong, to where I feel loved, and accepted, and provided for,<br>
I want to go to where I feel safe and protected, to where I can have healing, encouragement,<br>
I want to go to where I feel peace, where my family and I can rest, and relax.<br>
I don't know how to get up and walk away from here, I don't know how to get up, let go, and move on, and change direction.<br>
Lord Jesus, Help me get unstuck. Grab my hand, pull me up, point me in the right direction, minister to me, and walk with me.<br>
Bless the relationships that we each have with you, and bless the relationships that we each have with each other, and help us all get unstuck.<br>
Father God, comfort us, and Minister unto us, righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.<br>
I thankfully receive your forgiveness, and your good wisdom from above. Fill us now with your spirit, and your love.<br>
In Jesus' name, Amen.<br>

Psalms 32:8 KJV<br>
8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.<br>

(I will counsel thee, mine eye shall be upon thee.)<br>
<br>
<br>
We read all of Psalms 32 (11 verses total) back when we were at the end of Christian Essays 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also in Christian Essays 10, we were thinking about this...<br>
<br>
These next few words are not in the Bible.  They are just some things to think and pray about.<br>
<br>
Behold the bridle of you that taught me so. The Word of God.<br>
<br>
Behold the weapon that cuts. The Word of God.<br>
<br>
Behold, as He reveals the fence that separates,<br>
the weapon that cuts,<br>
Your eye is upon us, you are the God that Sees, you reveal truth to us.<br>
You are the door that opens up, and you are the path that we need to walk upon.<br>
<br>
<br>
You are the path, you are the way, the truth and the life.<br>
<br>
Open our eyes that we may see, so that you may reveal to us,<br>
The door to walk through, and the path to walk upon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 33:6 (KJV)<br>
Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 6:17 (KJV)<br>
Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 4:17 (KJV)<br>
They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 4: 14-23 NLT<br>
14 Then as I looked over the situation, I called together the nobles and the rest of the people and said to them, "Don't be afraid of the enemy! Remember the Lord, who is great and glorious, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes!"<br>
15 When our enemies heard that we knew of their plans and that God had frustrated them, we all returned to our work on the wall.<br>
16 But from then on, only half my men worked while the other half stood guard with spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail. The leaders stationed themselves behind the people of Judah<br>
17 who were building the wall. The labourers carried on their work with one hand supporting their load and one hand holding a weapon.<br>
18 All the builders had a sword belted to their side. The trumpeter stayed with me to sound the alarm.<br>
19 Then I explained to the nobles and officials and all the people, "The work is very spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.<br>
20 When you hear the blast of the trumpet, rush to wherever it is sounding. Then our God will fight for us!"<br>
21 We worked early and late, from sunrise to sunset. And half the men were always on guard.<br>
22 I also told everyone living outside the walls to stay in Jerusalem. That way they and their servants could help with guard duty at night and work during the day.<br>
23 During this time, none of us -- not I, nor my relatives, nor my servants, nor the guards who were with me -- ever took off our clothes. We carried our weapons with us at all times, even when we went for water.<br>

<br>
<br>
Revelation 3: 7 & 8 (KJV)<br>
These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;<br>
8 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 3: 7 & 8 NLT<br>
This is the message from the one who is holy and true,<br>
the one who has the key of David.<br>
What he opens, no one can close;<br>
and what he closes, no one can open: (quoting from Isaiah 22:22.)<br>
8"I know all the things you do, and I have opened a door for you that no one can close. You have little strength, yet you obeyed my word and did not deny me.<br>

Isaiah 22: 21-24 KJV<br>
21And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.<br>
22And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.<br>
23And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.<br>
24And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons (even to all the instruments of viols).<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 22: 21-24 NLT<br>
21I will dress him in your royal robes and will give him your title and your authority. And he will be a father to the people of Jerusalem and Judah.<br>
22I will give him the key to the house of David -- the highest position in the royal court. When he opens doors, no one will be able to close them; when he closes doors, no one will be able to open them.<br>
23He will bring honour to his family name, for I will drive him firmly in place like a nail in the wall.<br>
24They will give him great responsibility, and he will bring honour to even the lowliest members of his family.<br>
<br>
(They will hang on him all the glory of his father's house: its offspring and offshoots, all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.)<br>

<br>
John 10:7 (KJV)<br>
Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 10:9 (KJV)<br>
I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 10: 1-15 KJV<br>
1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.<br>
2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<br>
3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.<br>
4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.<br>
5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.<br>
6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.<br>
7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.<br>
8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.<br>
9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.<br>
10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.<br>
11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.<br>
12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.<br>
13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.<br>
14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.<br>
15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 10: 1-15 NLT<br>
1 "I tell you the truth, anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold, rather than going through the gate, must surely be a thief and a robber!<br>
2 But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.<br>
3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep recognise his voice and come to him. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.<br>
4 After he has gathered his own flock, he walks ahead of them, and they follow him because they know his voice.<br>
5 They won't follow a stranger; they will run from him because they don't know his voice."<br>
6 Those who heard Jesus use this illustration didn't understand what he meant,<br>
7 so he explained it to them: "I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.<br>
<br>
<br>
(All who came were thieves and robbers. But the true sheep did not listen to them.)<br>
8 All who came before me were thieves and robbers. But the true sheep did not listen to them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
9 Yes, I am the gate. Those who come in through me will be saved (and will find safety). They will come and go freely and will find good pastures.<br>
<br>
10 The thief's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy. My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.<br>
11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep.<br>
12 A hired hand will run when he sees a wolf coming. He will abandon the sheep because they don't belong to him and he isn't their shepherd. And so the wolf attacks them and scatters the flock.<br>
13 The hired hand runs away because he's working only for the money and doesn't really care about the sheep.<br>
14 "I am the good shepherd; I know my own sheep, and they know me,<br>
15 just as my Father knows me and I know the Father. So I sacrifice my life for the sheep.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4:26 (KJV)<br>
Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4: 25-27 NLT<br>
25<br>
Look straight ahead,<br>
and fix your eyes on what lies before you.<br>
26<br>
Mark out a straight path for your feet;<br>
stay on the safe path.<br>
27<br>
Don't get side-tracked;<br>
keep your feet from following evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 23:3 (KJV)<br>
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:35 (KJV)<br>
Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 14:17 (KJV)<br>
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, we will start at Romans 14, verse 13, and we will keep reading into the next chapter, chapter 15, not stopping until we get to Chapter 15, verse 5.<br>
To save time, we will only be reading this in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
13 So let's stop condemning each other. Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall.<br>
14 I know and am convinced on the authority of the Lord Jesus that no food, in and of itself, is wrong to eat. But if someone believes it is wrong, then for that person it is wrong.<br>
15 And if another believer is distressed by what you eat, you are not acting in love if you eat it. Don't let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died.<br>
16 Then you will not be criticised for doing something you believe is good.<br>
17 For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.<br>
18 If you serve Christ with this attitude, you will please God, and others will approve of you, too.<br>
19 So then, let us aim for harmony in the church and try to build each other up.<br>
<br>
20 Don't tear apart the work of God over what you eat. Remember, all foods are acceptable, but it is wrong to eat something if it makes another person stumble.<br>
<br>
21 It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble (or be offended, or be weakened).<br>
<br>
22 You may believe there's nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it between yourself and God. Blessed are those who don't feel guilty for doing something they have decided is right.<br>
23 But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are sinning if you go ahead and do it. For you are not following your convictions. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.<br>
1 We who are strong must be considerate of those who are sensitive about things like this. We must not just please ourselves.<br>
2 We should help others do what is right and build them up in the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
3 For even Christ didn't live to please himself. As the Scriptures say, "The insults of those who insult you, O God, have fallen on me."<br>
<br>
(...the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me. Psalms 69:9)<br>
<br>
<br>
4 Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God's promises to be fulfilled.<br>
5 May God, who gives this patience and encouragement, help you live in complete harmony with each other, as is fitting for followers of Christ Jesus.<br>

Some have argued about who the author was of the poem, titled, The Weaver.<br>
Some simply say that the author is unknown.<br>
<br>
The three names that people argue over as possible authors would be any one of the following three...<br>
<br>
Grant Colfax Tullar<br>
Benjamin Malacia Franklin<br>
Corrie Ten Boom<br>
<br>
or it just may as well be an unknown author.<br>
<br>
<br>
Grant Colfax Tullar (1869-1950)<br>
An American evangelist and, in 1893, founded the Tullar-Meredith music publishing house in New York.<br>
<br>
<br>
Benjamin Malacia Franklin (1882-1965)<br>
If this author and story were true, then it would be estimated that it was written around 1948 or 1949.<br>
It was first published in 'The Memphis Commercial Appeal' newspaper in 1950.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Corrie Ten Boom (1892-1983)<br>
A Dutch watchmaker, she was famous for helping many Jews escape the Nazi Holocaust during World War II by hiding them in her home.<br>
She wrote a famous autobiographical book, titled, The Hiding Place, which was made into a film in 1975.<br>
In her story, she talks about, in February 1944, she went to a concentration camp, in Germany, for hiding Jews in her home.<br>
She survives and later leaves the camp in December 1944 through what is discovered years later to have been a clerical error, as everyone else in her group of prisoners was gassed the next month (January 1945).<br>
<br>
Corrie Ten Boom -- Some of her famous quotes...<br>
"Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength."<br>
"Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God."<br>
"You may never know that Jesus is all you need, until Jesus is all you have."<br>
<br>
There are a few variations of the poem.<br>
All of the different versions have been merged together here, into one long poem.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, here are the words to the following poem,<br>
titled, The Weaver.<br>
<br>
<br>
My life is but a weaving<br>
Between my God and me.<br>
I cannot choose the colours<br>
He weaveth steadily.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oft' times He weaveth sorrow;<br>
And I in foolish pride<br>
Forget He sees the upper<br>
And I the underside.<br>
<br>
<br>
Not 'til the loom is silent<br>
And the shuttles cease to fly<br>
Will God unroll the canvas<br>
And reveal the reason why.<br>
<br>
<br>
The dark threads are as needful<br>
In the weaver's skilful hand<br>
As the threads of gold and silver<br>
In the pattern He has planned<br>
<br>
<br>
He knows, He loves, He cares;<br>
Nothing this truth can dim.<br>
He gives the very best to those<br>
Who leave the choice to Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
My life is but a weaving<br>
Between my Lord and me;<br>
I cannot choose the colours<br>
He worketh steadily.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sometimes He weaveth sorrow<br>
And I in foolish pride<br>
Forget He sees the upper,<br>
And I the under side.<br>
<br>
<br>
Not till the loom is silent<br>
And the shuttles cease to fly,<br>
Shall God unroll the canvas<br>
And explain the reason why.<br>
<br>
<br>
The dark threads are as needful<br>
In the Weaver's skilful hand,<br>
As the threads of gold and silver<br>
In the pattern He has planned.<br>
<br>
<br>
My life is but a weaving<br>
Between my God and me;<br>
I see the seams, the tangles,<br>
But He sees perfectly.<br>
<br>
<br>
He knows, He loves, He cares,<br>
Nothing this truth can dim;<br>
He gives His very best to those<br>
Who chose to walk with Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
My Life is but a weaving<br>
between my God and me;<br>
I may not choose the colours,<br>
He knows what they should be.<br>
<br>
<br>
For he can view the pattern<br>
upon the upper side,<br>
While I can see it only<br>
On this, the under side.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sometimes he weaveth sorrow,<br>
Which seemeth strange to me<br>
But I will trust his judgement,<br>
and work on faithfully.<br>
<br>
<br>
'Tis he who fills the shuttle,<br>
He knows just what is best;<br>
So I shall weave in earnest<br>
and leave with Him the rest.<br>
<br>
<br>
At last, when life is ended,<br>
with Him I shall abide,<br>
And I may view the pattern<br>
Upon the upper side,<br>
<br>
<br>
Then I shall know the reason<br>
why pain with joy entwined,<br>
was woven in the fabric<br>
of life that God designed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 55:8 (KJV)<br>
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.<br>

I, the Lord, created them.<br>

31 So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.<br>

Commentary: The seven names of the seven-fold spirit of God are believed to be listed here in Isaiah 11, verse 2.<br>
The spirit of the Lord is the first of the seven spirits listed.<br>
Sevenfold may also be connected with the biblical understanding of the number 7 representing perfection. The "Seven Fold Spirit of God" could be the "perfect" Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 11: 1-6 KJV<br>
1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:<br>
2 And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;<br>
<br>
3 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:<br>
(And shall make him of scent or, smell in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:)<br>
<br>
<br>
4 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, (and argue with equity for the meek of the earth,) and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.<br>
6 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 11: 1-10 NLT<br>
1<br>
(Out of the stump of the line of Jesse will grow a shoot -- Jesse was King David's father.)<br>
Out of the stump of David’s family will grow a shoot -- <br>
yes, a new Branch bearing fruit from the old root.<br>
2<br>
And the Spirit of the Lord will rest on him -- <br>
the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,<br>
the Spirit of counsel and might,<br>
the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.<br>
3<br>
He will delight in obeying the Lord.<br>
He will not judge by appearance<br>
nor make a decision based on hearsay.<br>
4<br>
He will give justice to the poor<br>
and make fair decisions for the exploited.<br>
The earth will shake at the force of his word,<br>
and one breath from his mouth will destroy the wicked.<br>
5<br>
He will wear righteousness like a belt<br>
and truth like an undergarment.<br>
6<br>
In that day the wolf and the lamb will live together;<br>
the leopard will lie down with the baby goat.<br>
The calf and the yearling will be safe with the lion,<br>
and a little child will lead them all.<br>
7<br>
The cow will graze near the bear.<br>
The cub and the calf will lie down together.<br>
The lion will eat hay like a cow.<br>
8<br>
The baby will play safely near the hole of a cobra.<br>
Yes, a little child will put its hand in a nest of deadly snakes without harm.<br>
9<br>
Nothing will hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain,<br>
for as the waters fill the sea,<br>
so the earth will be filled with people who know the Lord.<br>
10<br>
In that day the heir to David's throne<br>
will be a banner of salvation to all the world.<br>
<br>
(In that day the heir to the root of Jesse will be a banner of salvation to all the world.)<br>

<br>
From the story of when King Solomon Finishes the Furnishings for the Temple<br>
and then The Ark is Brought to the Temple...<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 5:13 (KJV)<br>
It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord;<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 5:13 NLT<br>
The trumpeters and singers performed together in unison to praise and give thanks to the Lord. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, they raised their voices and praised the Lord with these words:<br>
"He is good!<br>
His faithful love endures forever!"<br>
At that moment a thick cloud filled the Temple of the Lord. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, Solomon Praises the Lord<br>
and then Solomon does a Prayer of Dedication,<br>
and then, in chapter 7, we read about The Dedication of the Temple...<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 7:3 (KJV)<br>
And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 7:3 NLT<br>
When all the people of Israel saw the fire coming down and the glorious presence of the Lord filling the Temple, they fell face down on the ground and worshiped and praised the Lord, saying,<br>
"He is good!<br>
His faithful love endures forever!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The next verse is about Isaiah's Cleansing and Call...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 6:3 (KJV)<br>
And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 6:3 NLT<br>
They were calling out to each other,<br>
"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Heaven's Armies!<br>
The whole earth is filled with his glory!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, in 1 Timothy, chapter 1, we finish up reading about Paul's Gratitude for God's Mercy...<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 1:17 (KJV)<br>
Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
The book of Jude ends with this Prayer of Praise...<br>
<br>
Jude 1:25 KJV<br>
25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 4: 8 & 9 (KJV)<br>
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.<br>
9 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 4: 5-11 NLT<br>
5 From the throne came flashes of lightning and the rumble of thunder. And in front of the throne were seven torches with burning flames. This is the sevenfold Spirit of God.<br>
(They are the seven spirits of God.)<br>
6 In front of the throne was a shiny sea of glass, sparkling like crystal.<br>
In the centre and around the throne were four living beings, each covered with eyes, front and back.<br>
7 The first of these living beings was like a lion; the second was like an ox; the third had a human face; and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.<br>
8 Each of these living beings had six wings, and their wings were covered all over with eyes, inside and out. Day after day and night after night they keep on saying,<br>
"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty -- <br>
the one who always was, who is, and who is still to come."<br>
9 Whenever the living beings give glory and honour and thanks to the one sitting on the throne (the one who lives forever and ever),<br>
10 the twenty-four elders fall down and worship the one sitting on the throne (the one who lives forever and ever). And they lay their crowns before the throne and say,<br>
11 "You are worthy, O Lord our God,<br>
to receive glory and honour and power.<br>
For you created all things,<br>
and they exist because you created what you pleased."<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 4:11 KJV<br>
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 5: 11-14 KJV<br>
11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;<br>
12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.<br>
13 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.<br>
14 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 5: 9-14 NLT<br>
9<br>
And they sang a new song with these words:<br>
"You are worthy to take the scroll<br>
and break its seals and open it.<br>
For you were slaughtered, and your blood has ransomed people for God<br>
from every tribe and language and people and nation.<br>
10<br>
And you have caused them to become<br>
a Kingdom of priests for our God.<br>
And they will reign on the earth."<br>
(they are reigning on the earth.)<br>
11<br>
Then I looked again, and I heard the voices of thousands and millions of angels around the throne and of the living beings and the elders.<br>
12<br>
And they sang in a mighty chorus:<br>
"Worthy is the Lamb who was slaughtered --<br>
to receive power and riches<br>
and wisdom and strength<br>
and honour and glory and blessing."<br>
13<br>
And then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea. They sang:<br>
"Blessing and honour and glory and power<br>
belong to the one sitting on the throne<br>
and to the Lamb forever and ever."<br>
14<br>
And the four living beings said, "Amen!" And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped the Lamb.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 7:12 (KJV)<br>
Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 7: 10-12 NLT<br>
10<br>
And they were shouting with a great roar,<br>
"Salvation comes from our God who sits on the throne<br>
and from the Lamb!"<br>
11<br>
And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living beings. And they fell before the throne with their faces to the ground and worshiped God.<br>
12<br>
They sang,<br>
"Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom<br>
and thanksgiving and honour<br>
and power and strength belong to our God<br>
forever and ever! Amen."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 19:1 (KJV)<br>
And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:<br>
<br>
(Hallelujah is the transliteration of a Hebrew term that means "Praise the Lord.")<br>
<br>
Revelation 19:1 NLT<br>
After this, I heard what sounded like a vast crowd in heaven shouting,<br>
(Hallelujah)<br>
"Praise the Lord!<br>
Salvation and glory and power belong to our God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 19: 11-16 KJV<br>
11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.<br>
12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.<br>
13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.<br>
14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.<br>
15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.<br>
16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 19: 11-16 NLT<br>
11 Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. Its rider was named Faithful and True, for he judges fairly and wages a righteous war.<br>
12 His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself.<br>
13 He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title was the Word of God.<br>
14 The armies of heaven, dressed in the finest of pure white linen, followed him on white horses.<br>
15 From his mouth came a sharp sword to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He will release the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty, like juice flowing from a winepress.<br>
16 On his robe at his thigh (Or, On his robe and thigh) was written this title: King of all kings and Lord of all lords.<br>

"Revelation Song" is a song written by Jennie Lee Riddle. "Revelation Song" first gained exposure on U.S. Christian radio through a Christ for the Nations Institute 2004 live album, "Glorious," as well as on Gateway Worship's 2005 debut album, "Living for You," and subsequently included on Kari Jobe's second, self-titled album, released on 10 February 2009. It was later released by Phillips, Craig and Dean on 5 May 2009 as the lead single from their album, Fearless. Their version quickly gained popularity, reaching No. 1 on Billboards Hot Christian Songs chart in August 2009.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: It took at least five years of waiting from the time this song was written, to the time it became popular and famous.<br>
Not all good things happen overnight. Moses had to wait 40 years for that day when the burning bush appeared and gave him his exodus job assignment.<br>
Wait upon the Lord. Love is patient. Be patient. Being patient feels heavy, because it carries a lot of wait.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the lyrics to the song, "Revelation Song" written by Jennie Lee Riddle.<br>
