<br>
<p>
<br>
Jerusalem Prayers<br>
<br>
Pray for Jerusalem and Israel<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 125:2<br>
KJV:<br>
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem,<br>
so the Lord surrounds his people, both now and forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 12, verses 2 and 3<br>
<br>
Now the Lord had said unto Abram... (the man through which, from his offspring, would be the people that would eventually become the nation of Israel)<br>
<br>
KJV:<br>
2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:<br>
3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
2 I will make you into a great nation. I will bless you and make you famous, and you will be a blessing to others. <br>
3 I will bless those who bless you and curse those who treat you with contempt. All the families on earth will be blessed through you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 17:5 (KJV)<br>
Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.<br>
<br>
Genesis 17:5<br>
NLT<br>
I am changing your name. It will no longer be Abram. Instead, you will be called Abraham, for you will be the father of many nations.<br>
<br>
(Abram means "exalted father"; Abraham sounds like a Hebrew term that means "father of many.")
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Abraham had a son, Isaac, and Isaac had a son, Jacob. If we fast-forward to, later on in Jacob's life, 18 chapters later, after Isaac died, we see this...<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 35:10 (KJV)<br>
And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.<br>
<br>
Genesis 35:10<br>
NLT<br>
God blessed him, saying, "Your name is Jacob, but you will not be called Jacob any longer. From now on your name will be Israel." So God renamed him Israel.<br>
<br>
(Jacob sounds like the Hebrew words for "heel" and "deceiver." Israel means, "God fights.")<br>
<br>
Commentary: Now, if we rewind back a bit, before Jacob's name was changed to Israel, Jacob's old father, Isaac, gave him a blessing which included the following part...<br>
<br>
Genesis 27:29 (KJV)<br>
...cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 27:29 (NLT)<br>
"All who curse you will be cursed,<br>
and all who bless you will be blessed."<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Isaac is repeating to Jacob, later to be named Israel, the same blessing that the Lord gave to Abram, before his name was changed to Abraham.<br>
The Lord is also ready to give you a blessing right now, today, even before your name gets changed later on, when you arrive in Heaven, as the book of Revelation 2:17 tells us.<br>
<br>
Revelation 2:17<br>
NLT<br>
Jesus says,<br>
17 "Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he (the Sprit) is saying to the churches. To everyone who is victorious I (Jesus Christ) will give some of the manna that has been hidden away in heaven. And I will give to each one a white stone, and on the stone will be engraved a new name that no one understands except the one who receives it.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Since all of the descendants of the nation of Israel originally came from Abraham, and then the man called Israel, this blessing and curse can be applied to the nation of Israel.<br>
Therefore, when we say, "All", it is possible to say the All can include all people, all businesses and even all government nations, our own national government, and even you and me, personally.<br>
<br>
So, this blessing and curse could be interpreted to mean this...<br>
<br>
All who curse (the nation of Israel) will be cursed,<br>
and all who bless (the nation of Israel) will be blessed.<br>
<br>
So, what can we start doing now to help bless, and be a blessing for, the nation of Israel?<br>
We can start by praying for the nation of Israel, and to Pray for the peace of Israel's city, Jerusalem.<br>
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. We are commanded to this in Psalms 122, verse 6.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 122: 1-9<br>
<br>
KJV:
1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.<br>
2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.<br>
3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:<br>
4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.<br>
5 For there are set* thrones of judgement, the thrones of the house of David.<br>
<br>
*In the original Hebrew, it says, For there do sit thrones of judgement.<br>
<br>
6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.<br>
7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.<br>
8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.<br>
9 Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.<br>
<br>
Psalms 122: 1-9 -- NLT:<br>
A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. A psalm of David.<br>
1 I was glad when they said to me,<br>
"Let us go to the house of the Lord."<br>
2 And now here we are,<br>
standing inside your gates, O Jerusalem.<br>
3 Jerusalem is a well-built city;<br>
its seamless walls cannot be breached.<br>
4 All the tribes of Israel--the Lord's people--<br>
make their pilgrimage here.<br>
They come to give thanks to the name of the Lord,<br>
as the law requires of Israel.<br>
5 Here stand the thrones where judgement is given,<br>
the thrones of the dynasty of David.<br>
6 Pray for peace in Jerusalem.<br>
May all who love this city prosper.<br>
7 O Jerusalem, may there be peace within your walls<br>
and prosperity in your palaces.<br>
8 For the sake of my family and friends, I will say,<br>
"May you have peace."<br>
9 For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,<br>
I will seek what is best for you, O Jerusalem.<br>

<br>
Revelation Summary<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 22:3 (KJV)<br>
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 27:12 (KJV)<br>
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 13:15 (KJV)<br>
Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 21:18 (KJV)<br>
The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 21:18 NLT<br>
The wicked are punished in place of the godly,<br>
and traitors in place of the honest.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Think of some famous celebrity right now.<br>
Imagine if I spent hours researching that celebrity, learning all about them.<br>
Now imagine if I happen to walk up that famous person's house and say Hello to him or her.<br>
Would they let me into their house?  Probably not.<br>
Why? Just because you learn about someone or recognise someone's face does not mean that you have an actual friendship or relationship with that person.<br>
<br>
Just because you recognise the face of Jesus, or you have read about Jesus, does not mean that you have an actual relationship right now with Jesus.<br>
Why would He let you into Heaven if He does not even know who you are?<br>
Hear what Jesus is saying, and be a doer of the Word, by doing, following and obeying what the Bible says to do.<br>
Doing Romans 10:9 allows you to enter into this necessary relationship with Christ, and then, reading through your entire Bible and praying every day helps you remain close and strong in this important, eternal relationship, and in His love.<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 20-27<br>
20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.<br>
21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.<br>
22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?<br>
23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.<br>
24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:<br>
25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.<br>
26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:<br>
27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 18-27 (NLT)<br>
18 A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit. <br>
19 So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire. <br>
20 Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify people by their actions.<br>
21 "Not everyone who calls out to me, 'Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter. <br>
22 On judgement day many will say to me, 'Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.' <br>
23 But I will reply, 'I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God's laws.'<br>
24 "Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. <br>
25 Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse because it is built on bedrock. <br>
26 But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn't obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand. <br>
27 When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash."<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Joel 2: 11 & 12 (KJV)<br>
11 And the Lord shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?<br>
12 Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart....<br>
<br>
Joel 2: 11 & 12 (NLT)<br>
11<br>
The Lord is at the head of the column.<br>
He leads them with a shout.<br>
This is his mighty army,<br>
and they follow his orders.<br>
The day of the Lord is an awesome, terrible thing.<br>
Who can possibly survive?<br>
12<br>
That is why the Lord says,<br>
"Turn to me now, whilst there is time.<br>
Give me your hearts...."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Got Questions Ministries website at gotquestions.org has a nice, quick summary of the Tribulation.<br>
This ministry supports the pre-trib argument, where the rapture happens before the Tribulation.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Bible verses that support this summary are referenced within here.<br>
<br>
<br>
The exact webpage that we were looking at, in January 2019, is found here...<br>
<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/tribulation.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/tribulation.html</a><br>
Here are some selected, quoted parts put together from that webpage...<br>
<br>
"The church, made up of all who have trusted in the person and work of the Lord Jesus to save them from being punished for sin, will not be present during the tribulation. The church will be removed from the earth in an event known as the rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-53). The church is saved from the wrath to come (1 Thessalonians 5:9). Throughout Scripture, the tribulation is referred to by other names such as the Day of the Lord (Isaiah 2:12; Isaiah 13:6-9; Joel 1:15; Joel 2:1-31; Joel 3:14; 1 Thessalonians 5:2). The tribulation is referred to by other names such as trouble or tribulation (Deuteronomy 4:30; Zephaniah 1:1). The great tribulation, which refers to the more intense second half of the seven-year period (Matthew 24:21); time or day of trouble (Daniel 12:1; Zephaniah 1:15); or the time of Jacob's trouble (Jeremiah 30:7).<br>
<br>
"An understanding of Daniel 9:24-27 is necessary in order to understand the purpose and time of the tribulation. <br>
There is one seven-year period to be fulfilled in terms of Daniel 9:24<br>
<br>
"Daniel 9:27 gives a few highlights of the seven-year tribulation period. <br>
<br>
"'He will confirm a covenant with many for one 'seven.' In the middle of the 'seven' he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on a wing of the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.' The person of whom this verse speaks is the person Jesus calls the 'abomination that causes desolation' (Matthew 24:15) and is called 'the beast' in Revelation 13. Daniel 9:27 says that the beast will make a covenant for seven years, but in the middle of this so-called week (which is three-and-a-half years into the tribulation), he will break the covenant, putting a stop to sacrifice. Revelation 13 explains that the beast will place an image of himself in the temple and require the world to worship him. Revelation 13:5 says that this will go on for 42 months, which is 3 1/2 years. Since Daniel 9:27 says that this will happen in the middle of the week, and Revelation 13:5 says that the beast will do this for a period of 42 months, it is easy to see that the total length of time is 84 months or seven years. Also see Daniel 7:25, where the 'time, times, and half a time' (1 year, plus 2 years, plus half of a year, equals a total of three-and-a-half years) also refers to 'great tribulation,' the last half of the seven-year tribulation period when the beast will be in power.<br>
<br>
"Daniel 12:11-12, speaks of 1290 days and 1335 days. These days have a reference to the midpoint of the tribulation. The additional days in Daniel 12 may include the time at the end for the judgement of the nations (Matthew 25:31-46) and time for the setting up of Christ's millennial kingdom (Revelation 20:4-6).<br>
<br>
"In summary, the Tribulation is the 7-year time period in the end times."<br>
<br>
That is the end of the quoted parts from<br>
<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/tribulation.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/tribulation.html</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at Daniel 9: verses 24 through 27.<br>
<br>
(Original Hebrew meanings are included here within round brackets.)<br>
<br>
Daniel 9: 24-27 KJV<br>
24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.<br>
(Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to restrain the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophet, and to anoint the most Holy.)<br>
<br>
25 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.<br>
(Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall return and be built, and the breach or ditch, even in strait of times.)<br>
<br>
26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.<br>
(And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, and shall have nothing for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war it shall be cut off by desolations.)<br>
<br>
27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.<br>
(And he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and with the abominable armies overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolator.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 9: 24-27 NLT<br>
24 "A period of seventy sets of seven (A period of seventy sevens) has been decreed for your people and your holy city to finish their rebellion, to put an end to their sin, to atone for their guilt, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to confirm the prophetic vision, and to anoint the Most Holy Place (and to anoint the Most Holy One).<br>
25 Now listen and understand! Seven sets of seven plus sixty-two sets of seven (Seven sevens plus sixty-two sevens) will pass from the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until a ruler -- the Anointed One (an anointed one, a messiah) -- comes. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and strong defences (with a moat, and trenches) despite the perilous times.<br>
26 "After this period of sixty-two sets of seven, (After sixty-two sevens) the Anointed One will be killed, appearing to have accomplished nothing, and a ruler will arise whose armies will destroy the city and the Temple. The end will come with a flood, and war and its miseries are decreed from that time to the very end. <br>
27 The ruler will make a treaty with the people for a period of one set of seven, (one seven) but after half this time, he will put an end to the sacrifices and offerings. And as a climax to all his terrible deeds, he will set up a sacrilegious object that causes desecration, until the fate decreed for this defiler is finally poured out on him."<br>
(And on the wing, he will set up a sacrilegious object that causes an abomination of desolation until the fate decreed for this defiler is finally poured out on him.)<br>
(We are not exactly sure about the meaning of the Hebrew part that reads, And on the wing, The Hebrew for that part is uncertain.)<br>
<br>
Commentary: Perhaps there is an object in the soon to be re-built temple that has a wing on it, and this sacrilegious object is placed on that wing, or on one of the wings.<br>
If they were to find, or to take out of its hiding spot, or make a replica of the Ark of the Covenant, that Ark originally did have wings on it, but we do not really know if it's actually that or something else that has at least one wing on it.<br>
<br>
Commentary: If the Godly, saved, believing Christians should all suddenly disappear off of the face of the Earth all in one instant (in the blink of an eye), that is what we refer to as, being raptured, and if this rapture should happen before the Tribulation (pre-trib), the Bible supports the pre-trib argument.<br>
The Bible says that God has not appointed the saved, believing Christians unto wrath, and is not to pour out his anger on us.<br>
However, many of those who are also doing deep Bible studies are also interpreting a possible mid-trib or even a post-trib rapture.<br>
If it should be mid-trib, the Bible does promise that the Lord knows how to help protect His Godly people whilst also punishing the unjust and the wicked.<br>
So, if it should be mid-trib or even post-trib, He will see us, protect us, and deliver us through that time.<br>
If everyone thinks the rapture is not going to happen soon, that means it is going to happen soon!<br>
It is going to happen at the time when everyone does not expect it to, in the hour when you think not.<br>
God is on the throne and he has the right to do all of this however He wants to, be it pre-trib, mid-trib or even post-trib.<br>
Only the Lord knows. The Lord is the one who sets these times and dates.<br>
Even Jesus did not know or would not disclose that information about when all this will happen.<br>
The Lord delays or postpones all of this to give everyone a final chance to get Saved, and do Romans 10:9.<br>
When everyone who is supposed to get saved finally do get saved, (The fulness of the Gentiles,) then all of this will start to happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 11:25 (KJV)<br>
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.<br>
<br>
Romans 11: 24 & 25 (NLT)<br>
...if God was willing to do something contrary to nature by grafting you into his cultivated tree, he will be far more eager to graft the original branches back into the tree where they belong.<br>
25 I want you to understand this mystery, dear brothers and sisters, so that you will not feel proud about yourselves. Some of the people of Israel have hard hearts, but this will last only until the full number of Gentiles comes to Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 3:6 (KJV)<br>
That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 3:29 (KJV)<br>
Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:<br>
<br>
Romans 9:24 (KJV)<br>
Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5: 8-11 KJV<br>
8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.<br>
9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
10 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.<br>
11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5: 8-11 NLT<br>
8 But let us who live in the light be clearheaded, protected by the armour of faith and love, and wearing as our helmet the confidence of our salvation.<br>
9 For God chose to save us through our Lord Jesus Christ, not to pour out his anger on us. <br>
10 Christ died for us so that, whether we are dead or alive when he returns, we can live with him forever. <br>
11 So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 2:9 (KJV)<br>
9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgement to be punished:<br>
<br>
2 Peter 2:9 (NLT)<br>
...the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials, even whilst keeping the wicked under punishment until the day of final judgement. <br>
<br>
Matthew 25:13 (KJV)<br>
Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.<br>
<br>
Matthew 24:44 (KJV)<br>
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.<br>
<br>
Luke 12:40 (KJV)<br>
Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.<br>
<br>
Revelation 3:3 (KJV)<br>
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.<br>
<br>
Revelation 3:3 (NLT)<br>
Go back to what you heard and believed at first; hold to it firmly. Repent and turn to me again. If you don't wake up, I will come to you suddenly, as unexpected as a thief.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a short and simple look at the general content and structure of the material found in the book of Revelation.<br>
<br>
Much of the following commentaries, descriptions and summaries being presented here come from the teachings of<br>
Pastor Jon Courson at Applegate Christian Fellowship in Ruch, Oregon.<br>
The material was mainly extracted from various Revelation teachings throughout the years,<br>
from 1996 to 2010.<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Revelation is not a hard book to find.  It's the last book at the end of the Bible.<br>
In the same way how many textbooks and math books put the answers at the back of the book, the Bible does this too.  If you want to look up the answers, just go to the back of the book, the back of the Bible, where you will find the book of Revelation.<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Revelation is not a hard book to understand. It's the only book in the Bible that comes with its own Divine Outline.<br>
<br>
 Revelation, Chapter 1, Verse 19...<br>
<br>
KJV: Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;<br>
<br>
NLT: "Write down what you have seen--both the things that are now happening and the things that will happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note the sequence in how the information is being presented, in how the verse is worded.  It is strictly in chronological order, presented and documented in the precise sequence as it shall happen in time.<br>
<br>
1. thou hast seen -- the past events, The things which you have seen -- Chapter 1 -- The Lord's Person -- The revelation of the Resurrected Jesus<br>
<br>
2. The things which are -- the present and current events -- Chapters 2-3 – The Lord's People - Church history<br>
<br>
3. which shall be hereafter -- the events that are going to happen in the future -- The things which will take place after this – Chapters 4-22 -- The Lord's Program -- What's coming up, the rapture, tribulation and the forever-after happy ending.<br>
<br>
The author was being clearly commanded that the information being presented to him is to be kept strictly in the same order in which it is presented so that it maintains the exact order in which the events shall happen in time, from the past, into the present, and then into the future.<br>
<br>
Ch. 1 -- What John had seen, the vision of Jesus.<br>
<br>
Ch. 2 & 3 -- The things which are, the letters to the churches, represented as the seven candlesticks, or seven lampstands.<br>
<br>
Ch. 4 & 5 -- The Rapture -- We go to Heaven -- the lamps of fire, or, the seven lampstands are now in Heaven, now representing the Seven Sprits of God.<br>
<br>
Ch. 6 through 20 -- God's wrath is activated and poured out upon a Christ-rejecting, sinful world<br>
<br>
Ch. 20 and 21 -- and they all lived happily forever after<br>
<br>
<br>
Notice how 4 and 5 come before 6? 4 comes before 5, and 5 comes before 6. Always have and always will.<br>
<br>
To argue that the rapture does not happen until half way through the Tribulation (mid-Trib) would require parts of Revelation to be taken out of order.<br>
Many of the Bible stories and other passages all point towards the pre-trib Rapture.<br>
Did Lot have to dodge the fire and brimstone falling down as he left Sodom and Gomorrah?<br>
Was Noah's Ark starting to fill with the floodwaters when the Lord closed the door of the Ark?<br>
<br>
The Trump of God is what triggers the Rapture -- the sudden departure of all believing Christians off of the face of the Earth.<br>
The Trump of the angels are the trumpet sounds heard half-way through the 7-year Tribulation.<br>
 <br>
1 Thessalonians 4:16 & 17 (KJV)<br>
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:<br>
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 4: Verses 16 - 18, NLT:<br>
For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. First, the believers who have died (the dead in Christ) will rise from their graves. Then, together with them, we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Then we will be with the Lord forever. So encourage each other with these words.<br>
<br>
Zechariah 9:14 (KJV)<br>
And the Lord shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zechariah 9: 14 through 17 (to the end of Chapter 9) KJV:<br>
14 And the Lord shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.<br>
15 The Lord of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones (or, the stones of the sling); and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall (fill both the bowls) be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar.<br>
16 And the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.<br>
17 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful (or, grow, or, speak), and new wine the maids.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Zechariah 9: 14 through 17 (to the end of Chapter 9) NLT:<br>
14<br>
The Lord will appear above his people;<br>
his arrows will fly like lightning!<br>
The Sovereign Lord will sound the ram's horn<br>
and attack like a whirlwind from the southern desert.<br>
15<br>
The Lord of Heaven's Armies will protect his people,<br>
and they will defeat their enemies by hurling great stones.<br>
They will shout in battle as though drunk with wine.<br>
They will be filled with blood like a bowl,<br>
drenched with blood like the corners of the altar.<br>
16<br>
On that day the Lord their God will rescue his people,<br>
just as a shepherd rescues his sheep.<br>
They will sparkle in his land<br>
like jewels in a crown.<br>
17<br>
How wonderful and beautiful they will be!<br>
The young men will thrive on abundant grain,<br>
and the young women will flourish on new wine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As we look through Revelation Chapter 8, we see each Angel sounding a trumpet.  Each one is the trump of an angel, not the trump of God.<br>
It is the trump of God that triggers the rapture, not the trump of an angel.<br>
<br>
Revelation 8:2 (KJV)<br>
And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.<br>
<br>
Revelation 8:6 (KJV)<br>
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.<br>
<br>
Revelation 8:7 (KJV)<br>
The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.<br>
<br>
Revelation 8:8 (KJV)<br>
And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;<br>
<br>
Revelation 8:10 (KJV)<br>
And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;<br>
<br>
Revelation 8:12 (KJV)<br>
And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.<br>
<br>
Revelation 8:13 (KJV)<br>
And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!<br>
(end of Chapter 8)<br>
Revelation 9:1 (KJV)<br>
And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.<br>
<br>
Revelation 9:14 (KJV)<br>
Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.<br>
<br>
Revelation 11:15 (KJV)<br>
And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
After we are raptured, there will come onto the scene a selected group of people on the earth, in Revelation Chapter 14, the 144,000.<br>
<br>
<br>
God is on the throne and God is in control, and He can do it in whichever way he chooses, pre-trib or mid-trib.<br>
Almost all of the Bible most strongly and clearly indicates a pre-trib, when the rapture happens before the Wrath of God is activated and poured out upon a Christ-rejecting, sinful world.<br>
<br>
Again, notice how chapter 4 and 5 come before chapter 6? Always have and always will.<br>
<br>
In summary, here is another brief look at the "Divine Outline" as found in Revelation 1:19:<br>
The things which you have seen – Chapter 1 – The Lord's Person - The revelation of the Resurrected Jesus<br>
The things which are – Chapters 2-3 – The Lord's People - Church history<br>
The things which will take place after this – Chapters 4-22 -- The Lord's Program -- What's coming up, the rapture, tribulation and beyond<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Revelation is also the only book that comes with its own, built-in, automatic blessing.<br>
By just reading Revelation, or hearing someone read it to you, you will be automatically blessed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:3 (KJV)<br>
Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:3 (NLT)<br>
God blesses the one who reads the words of this prophecy to the church, and he blesses all who listen to its message and obey what it says, for the time is near.<br>
<br>
Just remember that it's not just about reading and hearing.  You also need to keep and obey.<br>
Yes, you will be blessed just by reading or hearing Revelation, but why settle for just fine and just OK when you can turn it up to a higher level?<br>
Don't just read the Bible.  Do the Bible!  Do it, keep it, obey it, and do what it is telling you to do.<br>
<br>
James 1:22 (KJV)<br>
But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.<br>
<br>
James 1:25 (KJV)<br>
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.<br>
<br>
Psalms 31:23 (KJV)<br>
O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.<br>

Secret Bible Study at In-N-Out Burgers<br>
<br>
<br>
According to the information provided by Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia, as of December 2023,<br>
<br>
In-N-Out Burger is an American regional chain of fast food restaurants<br>
with locations primarily in California and to a lesser extent the Southwest,<br>
from Oregon to Texas.<br>
It was founded in Baldwin Park, California, in 1948 by Harry Snyder, and his wife, Esther Snyder.<br>
Harry Snyder, was born in 1913 and he passed away in 1976.<br>
His wife, Esther Snyder, was born in 1920 and she passed away in the year of 2006.<br>
<br>
Harry Snyder was a Canadian-born businessman.<br>
He founded In-N-Out Burger along with his wife Esther Snyder.<br>
Snyder was one of the first people to develop the idea of a drive-through hamburger restaurant, where customers could order their food via an intercom.<br>
<br>
Snyder and his wife opened the first IN-N-OUT Burger on 22 October 1948, in the Los Angeles suburb of Baldwin Park, California, which is about 19 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
In-N-Out is described as California's first drive-through. By the mid-1950s, the chain had expanded to six stores in the Los Angeles area.<br>
<br>
Esther outlived her husband, Harry, who died in 1976 and both of their sons, Rich and Guy, one of whom, Rich, died in a plane crash in 1993, and the other, Guy, of a drug overdose in 1999.<br>
Rich Snyder became the company president after his father's death, and held that position until his death in 1993.<br>
<br>
The chain is currently headquartered in Irvine, California and has expanded outside Southern California into the rest of California, as well as into Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Texas, Oregon, and Colorado,<br>
and as of December 2023, there are plans for expansions into Idaho, New Mexico, and Tennessee.<br>
<br>
The current owner is the heiress to the In-N-Out Burger company, Lynsi Snyder, the Snyders' only grandchild.<br>
<br>
In-N-Out prints Bible citations in small print on areas of the product packaging.<br>
<br>
This practice began in the 1980s during Rich Snyder's presidency, a reflection of the evangelical Christian beliefs held by the Snyder family.<br>

<p>
<br>
Billy Graham's Life Verse<br>
<br>
If I was to go up to Billy Graham and ask him which verse in the Bible means the most to him, which verse would he choose?<br>
<br>
<br>
What is Billy Graham's Life Verse?<br>
I'm going to use the help of Wikipedia to help me answer some of these questions.<br>
<br>
<br>
First of all, who is Billy Graham?<br>
Billy Graham is an Evangelist. In Christianity, Evangelism is the commitment to or act of publicly preaching of the Gospel with the intention of spreading the message and teachings of Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Christians who specialise in evangelism are often known as evangelists, whether they are in their home communities or living as missionaries in the field, although some Christian traditions refer to such people as missionaries in either case. Some Christian traditions consider evangelists to be in a leadership position; they may be found preaching to large meetings or in governance roles.<br>
<br>
William Franklin Graham Junior, known as Billy Graham, is an American evangelical Christian evangelist, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, who became well known internationally after 1949. He is widely regarded as the most influential preacher of the 20th century.  He held large indoor and outdoor rallies.  His sermons were broadcast nationwide on radio and television networks, some still being re-broadcast into the 21st century. In his six decades of television, Graham is principally known for hosting the annual Billy Graham Crusades, which he began in 1947, until he concluded in 2005, at the time of his retirement. He also hosted the popular radio show, Hour of Decision, from 1950 to 1954.<br>
<br>
In the year 2001, Billy Graham received the medal, Knight of the British Empire (KBE), known as the Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his international contribution to civic and religious life over 60 years.<br>
<br>
If you should see KBE after his name, it is a reference to this honour.<br>
<br>
The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire is a British order of chivalry, rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences, work with charitable and welfare organisations, and public service.<br>
<br>
Chivalry, or the chivalric code, is an informal, varying code of conduct developed between the years of 1170 to 1220. It was never clearly documented or decided on what that code of conduct was exactly, nor was it ever properly or completely summarised in a single document, yet it is generally associated with the medieval institution of knighthood.<br>
<br>
The Middle Ages (or the Medieval Period) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century.<br>
<br>
A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, from the year 1000 AD until around 1250 AD, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior.<br>
<br>
If Billy Graham would have stayed on this earth by 7 November 2018, then, on that day, he would have celebrated his 100th birthday.<br>
<br>
<br>
But, that is not how it turned out.<br>
<br>
He went to Heaven on Wednesday morning at 7:46 am, on the 21st February 2018, departing from his mountain home in Montreat, North Carolina, at the age of 99.<br>
<br>
William Franklin Graham was born on 7 November 1918, four days before the end of World War I.<br>
<br>
He evangelised to nearly 215 million people in 185 countries over six decades and prayed with every United States President from Harry Truman to Donald Trump, 13 presidents total.<br>
<br>
His final New York City crusade before retiring in 2005 was sponsored by 1,400 regional churches from 82 denominations. <br>
<br>
Here is a quote from his book, Billy Graham, God's Ambassador: A Celebration of His Life and Ministry<br>
By Billy Graham. This book was first published on 1 October 1999.<br>
<br>
 "Someday you will read or hear that Billy Graham is dead. Don't you believe a word of it. I shall be more alive than I am now. I will just have changed my address. I will have gone into the presence of God."<br>
<br>
<br>
That reminds me of the quoted words from an audio recording of Pastor Chuck Smith, saying these words in a sermon...<br>
<br>
"And, one of these days, should the Lord tarry, you'll no doubt will pick up your paper and read, Chuck Smith died last night, Pastor of Calvary Chapel, etc., etc., etc.<br>
Don't believe it.  That's poor reporting.<br>
If they're going to tell the truth, they're going to have to say,<br>
Chuck Smith MOVED last night, out of a decrepit, old, leaky tent, into a beautiful, new mansion.<br>
Hey! You don't need to weep for me because I have moved out of tent into the house, the building of God, not made with hands, you see.<br>
Death for the Child of God."<br>
<br>
A paraphrase of these words, similar, but not perfectly matching the quoted audio recording, were included in the Word for Today Bible,<br>
which is a New King James Version (NKJV) (1982) Bible with commentaries from Chuck Smith embedded throughout the Scriptures.<br>
It's really nice, because you get to enjoy the commentaries of Chuck Smith as you also read along through the NKJV of the Bible.<br>
<br>
The first edition of the Word for Today Bible was published on 28 February 2006.<br>
A revised and updated edition was released in 2012.<br>
<br>
When looking at the first edition, we find this paraphrased commentary being part of the commentary titled, Eternal Life, providing insight for Acts 7:60,<br>
originally found in the paper version of the Word for Today Bible, first edition, on paper page 1425, just before the start of Acts 8.<br>
I personally think that he was actually remembering a verse from the second letter of Peter (2 Peter), chapter 1...<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1 (KJV)<br>
13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;<br>
14 Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.<br>
15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1, NLT:<br>
12 Therefore, I will always remind you about these things -- even though you already know them and are standing firm in the truth you have been taught. <br>
13 And it is only right that I should keep on reminding you as long as I live (as long as I am in this tent, or tabernacle). <br>
14 For our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me that I must soon leave this earthly life, (I must soon put off my earthly tent, or tabernacle,) <br>
15 so I will work hard to make sure you always remember these things after I am gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What is a Life Verse?<br>
A life verse is a verse from the Bible (or a small passage) that you choose to be your most favourite verse; it is the one that you commit to memory to share with others. When you spend lots of time in Christian circles, you should expect that someone may ask you about your life verse.<br>
<br>
A life verse is a particular Bible verse that means something special to a believer. It's not uncommon for new Christians who are getting to know each other to ask about each other's life verse. Quite commonly, talking about life verses can lead to conversations about how someone converted to Christianity and what they feel like God wants them to do with their life.<br>
<br>
The term, life verse, is only about 100 years old. The earliest discovered citation of the term is from 1921.<br>
<br>
<br>
Who is Franklin Graham?<br>
Franklin Graham is Billy Graham's son.<br>
William Franklin Graham III (born July 14, 1952) is a Christian evangelist and missionary, who frequently engages in Christian revival tours and political commentary. He is currently president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) and of Samaritan's Purse, an international Christian relief organisation. He became a "committed Christian" in 1974 and was ordained in 1982, since becoming a public speaker and author. He is also known for being the son of American Evangelist Billy Graham.<br>
<br>
He will turn 66 years old after 14 July 2018.<br>
<br>
<br>
Franklin Graham's life was not all perfect.<br>
Franklin Graham remembers a time in his life when he was not yet truly following and walking with the Lord.<br>
In an article that Franklin Graham submitted to USA Today on 21 February 2018, he shares the following story...<br>
<br>
Headline: Billy Graham's new home, by Franklin Graham<br>
<br>
The article was originally published by USA Today as an Opinion article, and was located here...<br>
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/02/21/billy-grahams-new-home-franklin-graham/360065002/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/02/21/billy-grahams-new-home-franklin-graham/360065002/</a><br>
<br>
Here is an excerpt from that article, written by Franklin Graham...<br>
<br>
"On most Sundays for the past 20 years (1998 to 2018), I have driven an hour-and-a-half to have lunch and spend the afternoon with my father. I'll forever cherish these special times we spent together. But there was a time when our relationship wasn't so good, a time when I caused my mother and father quite a bit of anguish and heartache. During my teens and early 20s, I proved to be anything but what most people expected Billy Graham's son to be. I'm so thankful he never gave up on me or quit loving me.<br>
<br>
"After graduating from college in 1974, I headed for Lausanne, Switzerland, to work at a conference the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association was sponsoring for 2,500 evangelical leaders from around the world. My life was a mess; I was empty and lonely. During that conference, my mother and father wanted to take me to lunch to celebrate my 22nd birthday. After lunch at a little Italian restaurant on Lake Geneva, Daddy and I walked along a pathway beside the lake when he turned to me and said, "Franklin, your mother and I sense there's a struggle going on in your life." Somewhat stunned, I wondered, "How does he know this?" He continued, "You're going to have to make a choice either to accept Christ or reject Him. You can't continue to play the middle ground."<br>
<br>
"With my mind racing, wondering what he was going to say next, I heard these words: "I want you to know we're proud of you, Franklin. We love you no matter what you do in life and no matter where you go. But you're going to have to make a choice." He had pricked my conscience to the point I was actually angry. I couldn't figure out how he knew about the struggle that had been going on inside me -- but he did, and he was right. <br>
<br>
"My father's words haunted me for several weeks until I finally gave up running from God and made that choice to accept Jesus Christ as my personal Saviour and turn my life over to Him. I've never looked back or regretted my decision. <br>
<br>
"About 20 years after our life-changing walk along Lake Geneva, my father told me something else that would alter my life in another way; he asked me to assume the day-to-day management responsibility of the organisation that bears his name. I'm at least smart enough to know I could never fill Billy Graham's shoes, but I'm grateful he gave me an opportunity to help him finish his race on earth well, and to continue his life's work."<br>
<br>
In that same article, Franklin Graham also recalls a time when his dad, Billy Graham, once told British TV personality David Frost in an interview: "Well, I'm going to heaven," he said, "not on my good works or because I've preached to all these people or read the Bible. I'm going to heaven because of what Christ did on the cross."<br>

Billy Graham's Life Verse<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:14<br>
KJV:<br>
But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
As for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that cross, because of him, my interest in this world has been crucified, and the world's interest in me has also died.<br>
<br>
<br>
Published on Thursday 12 October 2017<br>
<br>
Franklin Graham gave the world a glimpse into his father's personal walk with God by revealing the one verse he's held on to his whole life. <br>
<br>
"Still today, my father Billy Graham has a Bible verse pinned up on the wall in his bedroom, printed in VERY large letters. In fact, it's in the dining room, his bathroom, and several other spots around the house!" Graham began in a Facebook post. "Galatians 6:14 says, 'But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.'"<br>
<br>
"It was his passion to memorise it, to saturate his heart and mind with it. He made it his life verse," Graham added. <br>
<br>
<br>
Since we are looking at Galatians 6:14, Lecrae had an interesting song that referred to Galatians 6:14.<br>
<br>
<br>
Who is Lecrae?<br>
Lecrae is an American Christian hip hop recording artist, songwriter, record producer, and actor. He is the president, co-owner and co-founder of the independent record label Reach Records.<br>
<br>
As of February 2018, he had released seven studio albums by that time.<br>
<br>
His actual, full name is Lecrae Devaughn Moore.<br>
<br>
The fourth studio album by Christian hip hop artist Lecrae was titled, Rehab, and was released in 2010.<br>
<br>
On that album was a song called, Boasting, and it contained a good amount of material that pointed to Galatians 6:14.<br>
Take a look at the lyrics to the 2010 song, Boasting, by Lecrae...<br>
<br>
"Boasting"<br>
(feat. Anthony Evans)<br>
<br>
<br>
If this life has anything to gain at all<br>
I'll count it loss if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you.<br>
Can't walk this earth alone.<br>
I recognise I'm not my own, so before I fall<br>
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
With every breath I take, with every heart beat,<br>
Sunrise and the moon lights in the dark street.<br>
Every glance, every dance, every note of a song.<br>
It's all a gift undeserved that I shouldn't have known.<br>
Every day that I lie, every moment I covet<br>
I'm deserving to die, I'm just earning your judgement.<br>
I, without the cross there's only condemnation.<br>
If Jesus wasn't executed there's no celebration.<br>
So in times that are good, in times that are bad<br>
For any times that I've had it all I will be glad.<br>
And I will boast in the cross. I'll boast in my pains.<br>
I will boast in the sunshine, boast in his reign.<br>
What's my life if it's not praising you?<br>
Another dollar in my bank account of vain pursuit.<br>
I do not count my life as any value or precious at all.<br>
Let me finish my race, let me answer my call.<br>
<br>
<br>
If this life has anything to gain at all<br>
I'll count it loss if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you.<br>
Can't walk this earth alone.<br>
I recognise I'm not my own, so before I fall<br>
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tomorrow's never promised, but it is we swear.<br>
Think we holding our own, just a fist full of air.<br>
God has never been obligated to give us life.<br>
If we fought for our rights, we'd be in hell tonight.<br>
Mere sinners owed nothing but a fierce hand.<br>
We never loved him, we pushed away his pierced hands.<br>
I rejected his love, grace, kindness, and mercy.<br>
Dying of thirst, yet, willing to die thirsty.<br>
Eternally worthy, how could I live for less?<br>
Patiently you turned my heart away from selfishness.<br>
I volunteer for your sanctifying surgery.<br>
I know the Spirit's purging me of everything that's hurting me.<br>
Remove the veil from my darkened eyes.<br>
So now every morning I open your word and see the Son rise.<br>
I hope in nothin, boast in nothin, only in your suffering.<br>
I live to show your glory, dying to tell your story.<br>
<br>
<br>
If this life has anything to gain at all<br>
I'll count it loss if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you.<br>
Can't walk this earth alone.<br>
I recognise I'm not my own, so before I fall<br>
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Glory was solely meant for you.<br>
Doing what no one else could do.<br>
With All I have to give, (With all I have to Give)<br>
I'll use my life, I'll use my lips. (My Lips Yeaaah)<br>
I'll only glory in your Word. What gift to me I don't deserve.<br>
I'll live in such a way that it reflects to you, my Praise.<br>
<br>
<br>
If this life has anything to gain at all<br>
I'll count it loss if I can't hear you, feel you, 'cause I need you.<br>
Can't walk this earth alone.<br>
I recognise I'm not my own, so before I fall<br>
I need to hear you, feel you, as I live to make my boast in you alone.<br>

The Doer<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Doer -- Better Than Reading, Better than Hearing<br>
<br>
<br>
Better Than Reading is Studying with Understanding, Better than Hearing is Following, Obeying and Actually Doing The Bible<br>
Don't just read it, study it -- don't just hear the Bible, Do the Bible, Do What it is telling you to do.<br>
<br>
This is a look at how one's attitude could be as a result of studying and doing the Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah Chapter 8<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Nehemiah Chapter 8 -- The entire chapter is very interesting and worth studying, but pay special attention to verses 8 through 12.<br>
Those verses are grouped into a separate paragraph below so your eyes can easily go to those particular verses.<br>
<br>
<br>
They were all reading and studying the scripture, but look closely as it describes the way how they studied the scriptures.<br>
After verse 12, notice their response, their attitude, and their actions and doings, as a result of studying and doing the Bible, actually trying to do what the Bible was telling them to do.<br>
The meaning of the original Hebrew word is explained within round brackets.<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 8<br>
1 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel.<br>
2 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding (that understood in hearing), upon the first day of the seventh month.<br>
3 And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate (from the light) from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.<br>
4 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood (a tower of wood), which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.<br>
5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight (in the eyes) of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:<br>
6 And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the Lord with their faces to the ground.<br>
7 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.<br>
<br>
<br>
8 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.<br>
9 And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha (the governor, the title of a Persian deputy or governor), and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.<br>
10 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength.<br>
11 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.<br>
12 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.<br>
<br>
<br>
13 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law (that they might instruct in the words of the law).<br>
14 And they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses (by the hand of Moses), that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:<br>
15 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.<br>
16 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.<br>
17 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.<br>
18 Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn (a restraint) assembly (to restrain, halt, stop the feast), according unto the manner.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 8<br>
NLT<br>
Ezra Reads the Law<br>
Starting at the end of the previous chapter, Nehemiah 7, last verse of Chapter 7, verse 73<br>
So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Temple servants, and some of the common people settled near Jerusalem. The rest of the people returned to their own towns throughout Israel.<br>
<br>
(Nehemiah 7:73 happened in the seventh month, according to the original Hebrew. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar could sometimes land within September and October. This event here in Nehemiah, Chapters 7 & 8 occurred within the months of October and November 445 b.c.)<br>
(Looking again at the original Hebrew wording, Nehemiah 8:2 happened on the first day of the seventh month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was October 8, 445 b.c.)<br>
<br>
In October, when the Israelites had settled in their towns, all the people assembled with a unified purpose at the square just inside the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had given for Israel to obey.<br>
So on October 8, 445 b.c., Ezra the priest brought the Book of the Law before the assembly, which included the men and women and all the children old enough to understand. He faced the square just inside the Water Gate from early morning until noon and read aloud to everyone who could understand. All the people listened closely to the Book of the Law.<br>
Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform that had been made for the occasion. To his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah. To his left stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. Ezra stood on the platform in full view of all the people. When they saw him open the book, they all rose to their feet.<br>
Then Ezra praised the Lord, the great God, and all the people chanted, "Amen! Amen!" as they lifted their hands. Then they bowed down and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground.<br>
The Levites--Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah--then instructed the people in the Law whilst everyone remained in their places. <br>
<br>
Here are verses 8 through 12 in the NLT:<br>
<br>
They read from the Book of the Law of God and clearly explained the meaning of what was being read, helping the people understand each passage.<br>
Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were interpreting for the people said to them, "Don't mourn or weep on such a day as this! For today is a sacred day before the Lord your God." For the people had all been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law.<br>
And Nehemiah (, he) continued, "Go and celebrate with a feast of rich foods and sweet drinks, and share gifts of food with people who have nothing prepared. This is a sacred day before our Lord. Don't be dejected and sad, for the joy of the Lord is your strength!"<br>
And the Levites, too, quieted the people, telling them, "Hush! Don't weep! For this is a sacred day." So the people went away to eat and drink at a festive meal, to share gifts of food, and to celebrate with great joy because they had heard God's words and understood them.<br>
<br>
<br>
(The Hebrew wording of the next verse, verse 13, has the Hebrew date of the second day, of the seventh month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was October 9, 445 b.c.)<br>
<br>
On October 9, 445 b.c. the family leaders of all the people, together with the priests and Levites, met with Ezra the scribe to go over the Law in greater detail. <br>
<br>
<br>
As they studied the Law, they discovered that the Lord had commanded through Moses that the Israelites should live in shelters during the festival to be held that month.<br>
<br>
<br>
(The Hebrew wording in this area again is in the seventh month, referring again to the seventh month of the ancient Hebrew Lunar Calendar. The Festival of Shelters usually lands within the months of September and October.)<br>
Commentary:  On the day that they are reading this, they would discover that they are only 13 days away from when they should begin the Festival of Shelters.<br>
What a perfect opportunity!  They are studying and learning the scriptures right now, and they are just 13 days away from being able to actually Do the Bible...<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at this feast that would eventually be known as the Festival of Shelters.<br>
It's in the book of Leviticus, chapter 23.<br>
Leviticus 23, verses 39 through 43, NLT:<br>
<br>
Verse 39 -- "Remember that this seven-day festival to the Lord -- the Festival of Shelters -- begins on the fifteenth day of the appointed month, (on the fifteenth day of the seventh month,) after you have harvested all the produce of the land. The first day and the eighth day of the festival will be days of complete rest. On the first day gather branches from magnificent trees (or, gather fruit from majestic trees) -- palm fronds, boughs from leafy trees, and willows that grow by the streams. Then celebrate with joy before the Lord your God for seven days. <br>
Verse 41 -- You must observe this festival to the Lord for seven days every year. This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed in the appointed month (which, in Hebrew, is the seventh month) from generation to generation. For seven days you must live outside in little shelters. All native-born Israelites must live in shelters. This will remind each new generation of Israelites that I made their ancestors live in shelters when I rescued them from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God."<br>
<br>
Now, let's go back to where we left off in the book of Nehemiah. Chapter 8, continuing in verse 15, NLT.<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 8:15 (NLT) -- He had said that a proclamation should be made throughout their towns and in Jerusalem, telling the people to go to the hills to get branches from olive trees, wild olive trees, (or pine; the original Hebrew called the wild olive tree an "oil tree." They were also told to go to the hills to get branches from) myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees. They were to use these branches to make shelters in which they would live during the festival, as prescribed in the Law.<br>
So the people went out and cut branches and used them to build shelters on the roofs of their houses, in their courtyards, in the courtyards of God's Temple, or in the squares just inside the Water Gate and the Ephraim Gate. So everyone who had returned from captivity lived in these shelters during the festival, and they were all filled with great joy! The Israelites had not celebrated like this since the days of Joshua, son of Nun (Joshua is also known in the Hebrew as Jeshua.)<br>
Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God on each of the seven days of the festival. Then on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, as was required by law.<br>
<br>
That is the end of Nehemiah, chapter 8.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  They were hearers of the word, studying and listening carefully so that they understood, and they put it into action, and became doers of the word.<br>

<br>
James 1:22 (KJV)<br>
But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.<br>
<br>
James 1:23 & 24 (KJV)<br>
For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1: verses 19 through 27 (KJV):<br>
19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:<br>
20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.<br>
21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.<br>
22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.<br>
23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:<br>
24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.<br>
25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.<br>
26 If any man amongst you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br>
27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1: verses 19 through 27 (NLT):<br>
Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. Human anger (a man's anger) does not produce the righteousness (or the justice) God desires. So get rid of all the filth and evil in your lives, and humbly accept the word God has planted in your hearts, for it has the power to save your souls.<br>
But don't just listen to God's word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves. For if you listen to the word and don't obey, it is like glancing at your face in a mirror. You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like. But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don't forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.<br>
If you claim to be religious but don't control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless. Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:25 (KJV)<br>
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.<br>
<br>
James 4:11 (KJV)<br>
Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.<br>

There is an area in Isaiah 58, known as Isaiah 58 Lip Service.<br>
Can you find it?<br>
What is Lip Service?<br>
<br>
Chambers 21st Century Dictionary:<br>
Lip Service is, insincere praise or worship. Respect or loyalty that someone appears to show, but which is not really held. <br>
To pay lip-service to someone or something is to pretend to agree with someone or approve of an idea, etc. without really doing so.<br>
<br>
The definition of "lip service" from the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary.<br>
to say that you agree with something but do nothing to support it.<br>
<br>
Collins English Dictionary:<br>
When you say that someone pays lip service to an idea, you are critical of them because they say they are in favour of it, but they do not do anything to support it.<br>
Insincere support or respect expressed but not put into practice.<br>
Insincere expression of respect, loyalty, support, etc.<br>

Isaiah 58, KJV<br>
1 Cry aloud, (cry with the throat,) spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.<br>
2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.<br>
3 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours (and exact all your things wherewith ye grieve others, and exact all your griefs)<br>
4 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: (ye fast not as this day) ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.<br>
5 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? (to afflict his soul for a day?) a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?<br>
6  Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, (to undo the bundles of the yoke) and to let (the broken,) the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?<br>
7 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? (and that thou bring the poor that are afflicted?) when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?<br>
8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward (or rear guard; the glory of the Lord shall gather thee up)<br>
9 Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;<br>
10 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday:<br>
11 And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought (or droughts), and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. (whose waters lie not, or, deceive not.)<br>
12 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.<br>
13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:<br>
14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.<br>

"Shout with the voice of a trumpet blast.<br>
Shout aloud! Don't be timid.<br>
Tell my people Israel of their sins!<br>
(Tell my people Jacob of their sins!)<br>
2<br>
Yet they act so pious!<br>
They come to the Temple every day<br>
and seem delighted to learn all about me.<br>
They act like a righteous nation<br>
that would never abandon the laws of its God.<br>
They ask me to take action on their behalf,<br>
pretending they want to be near me.<br>

'We have fasted before you!' they say.<br>
'Why aren't you impressed?<br>
We have been very hard on ourselves,<br>
and you don't even notice it!'<br>
"I will tell you why!" I respond.<br>
"It's because you are fasting to please yourselves.<br>
Even whilst you fast,<br>
you keep oppressing your workers.<br>
4<br>
What good is fasting<br>
when you keep on fighting and quarrelling?<br>
This kind of fasting<br>
will never get you anywhere with me.<br>
5<br>
You humble yourselves<br>
by going through the motions of penance,<br>
bowing your heads<br>
like reeds bending in the wind.<br>
You dress in burlap<br>
and cover yourselves with ashes.<br>
Is this what you call fasting?<br>
Do you really think this will please the Lord?<br>
6<br>
"No, this is the kind of fasting I want:<br>
Free those who are wrongly imprisoned;<br>
lighten the burden of those who work for you.<br>
Let the oppressed go free,<br>
and remove the chains that bind people.<br>
7<br>
Share your food with the hungry,<br>
and give shelter to the homeless.<br>
Give clothes to those who need them,<br>
and do not hide from relatives who need your help.<br>
8<br>
"Then your salvation will come like the dawn,<br>
and your wounds will quickly heal.<br>
Your godliness will lead you forward,<br>
and the glory of the Lord will protect you from behind.<br>
9<br>
Then when you call, the Lord will answer.<br>
'Yes, I am here,' he will quickly reply.<br>
"Remove the heavy yoke of oppression.<br>
Stop pointing your finger and spreading vicious rumours!<br>
10<br>
Feed the hungry,<br>
and help those in trouble.<br>
Then your light will shine out from the darkness,<br>
and the darkness around you will be as bright as noon.<br>
11<br>
The Lord will guide you continually,<br>
giving you water when you are dry<br>
and restoring your strength.<br>
You will be like a well-watered garden,<br>
like an ever-flowing spring.<br>
12<br>
Some of you will rebuild the deserted ruins of your cities.<br>
Then you will be known as a rebuilder of walls<br>
and a restorer of homes.<br>

"Keep the Sabbath day holy.<br>
Don't pursue your own interests on that day,<br>
but enjoy the Sabbath<br>
and speak of it with delight as the Lord's holy day.<br>
Honour the Sabbath in everything you do on that day,<br>
and don't follow your own desires or talk idly.<br>

Then the Lord will be your delight.<br>
I will give you great honour<br>
and satisfy you with the inheritance I promised to your ancestor Jacob.<br>
I, the Lord, have spoken!"<br>

Deuteronomy 18: 9-14 -- KJV<br>
9 When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.<br>
10 There shall not be found amongst you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,<br>
11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.<br>
12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee.<br>
13 Thou shalt be perfect (upright, sincere) with the Lord thy God.<br>
14 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, (which thou shalt inherit,) hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 18: 9-14 -- NLT:<br>
"When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, be very careful not to imitate the detestable customs of the nations living there. <br>
For example, never sacrifice your son or daughter as a burnt offering. (Never make your son or daughter pass through the fire.) And do not let your people practice fortune-telling, or use sorcery, or interpret omens, or engage in witchcraft, or cast spells, or function as mediums or psychics, or call forth the spirits of the dead. <br>
Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord. It is because the other nations have done these detestable things that the Lord your God will drive them out ahead of you. <br>
But you must be blameless before the Lord your God. The nations you are about to displace consult sorcerers and fortune-tellers, but the Lord your God forbids you to do such things."<br>

31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:<br>

Luke 10: 25-37 -- KJV<br>
25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<br>
26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?<br>
27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.<br>
29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?<br>
30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell amongst thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.<br>
31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.<br>
32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.<br>
33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,<br>
34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.<br>
35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.<br>
36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell amongst the thieves?<br>
37 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.<br>
<br>
Luke 10: 25-37 -- NLT<br>
(The meaning of the original Greek word is enclosed in round brackets.)<br>
<br>
25 One day an expert in religious law stood up to test Jesus by asking him this question: "Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?"<br>
26 Jesus replied, "What does the law of Moses say? How do you read it?"<br>
27 The man answered, "'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind.' And, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"<br>
(The man is quoting from Deuteronomy 6:5; and Leviticus 19:18.)<br>
<br>
<br>
28 "Right!" Jesus told him. "Do this and you will live!"<br>
29 The man wanted to justify his actions, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbour?"<br>
30 Jesus replied with a story: "A Jewish man was travelling from Jerusalem down to Jericho, and he was attacked by bandits. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him up, and left him half dead beside the road.<br>
31 "By chance a priest came along. But when he saw the man lying there, he crossed to the other side of the road and passed him by. <br>
32 A Temple assistant (a Levite) walked over and looked at him lying there, but he also passed by on the other side.<br>
33 "Then a despised Samaritan came along, and when he saw the man, he felt compassion for him.<br>
34 Going over to him, the Samaritan soothed his wounds with olive oil and wine and bandaged them. Then he put the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn, where he took care of him.<br>
35 The next day he handed the innkeeper two silver coins (the amount of money described here, in the original Greek, was, two denarii. A denarius was equivalent to a labourer's full day's wage. He hands this money to the innkeeper and says to the innkeeper) telling him, 'Take care of this man. If his bill runs higher than this, I'll pay you the next time I'm here.'<br>
36 "Now which of these three would you say was a neighbour to the man who was attacked by bandits?" Jesus asked.<br>
37 The man replied, "The one who showed him mercy."<br>
Then Jesus said, "Yes, now go and do the same."<br>
<br>

And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. <br>

Ephesians 2 (KJV) Verses 8, 9, and 10...<br>
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2, NLT:<br>
8 God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can't take credit for this; it is a gift from God. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.<br>
<br>
A great example of this is Lot.<br>
First, the Old Testament:<br>
Genesis 13: 1-13 -- KJV<br>
1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.<br>
2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.<br>
3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth–el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth–el and Ai;<br>
4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.<br>
5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.<br>
6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.<br>
7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.<br>
8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.<br>
9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.<br>
10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.<br>
11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.<br>
12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.<br>
13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.<br>
<br>
Genesis 13: 1-13 -- NLT:<br>
So Abram left Egypt and travelled north into the Negev, along with his wife and Lot and all that they owned. (Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.) From the Negev, they continued travelling by stages toward Bethel, and they pitched their tents between Bethel and Ai, where they had camped before. This was the same place where Abram had built the altar, and there he worshiped the Lord again.<br>
Lot, who was travelling with Abram, had also become very wealthy with flocks of sheep and goats, herds of cattle, and many tents. But the land could not support both Abram and Lot with all their flocks and herds living so close together. So disputes broke out between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot. (At that time Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land.)<br>
Finally Abram said to Lot, "Let's not allow this conflict to come between us or our herdsmen. After all, we are close relatives! The whole countryside is open to you. Take your choice of any section of the land you want, and we will separate. If you want the land to the left, then I'll take the land on the right. If you prefer the land on the right, then I'll go to the left."<br>
Lot took a long look at the fertile plains of the Jordan Valley in the direction of Zoar. The whole area was well watered everywhere, like the garden of the Lord or the beautiful land of Egypt. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) Lot chose for himself the whole Jordan Valley to the east of them. He went there with his flocks and servants and parted company with his uncle Abram. So Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot moved his tents to a place near Sodom and settled amongst the cities of the plain. But the people of this area were extremely wicked and constantly sinned against the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Lot made a big decision, and decided to go in a certain direction.  When he was making this decision, did Lot pray to the Lord and ask Him which direction would be best?<br>
Lot made his decision by leaning on his own understanding, doing what he thought and saw to be right in his own eyes, and made a decision based on what looked good, based on physical, visual appearances, going where he thought more money could be made, never seeking the Lord in prayer for guidance.<br>
In the Old Testament, here in the book of Genesis, there is not a single good thing said about Lot.  He did not do any good works, he did not make any good choices, and he never cried out to the Lord in prayer, and did not seek God's will at all.<br>
<br>
Knowing this about Lot, we jump over to the other end of the Bible, into the New Testament...<br>
<br>
The second letter of Peter, Chapter 2...<br>
2 Peter 2, verses 6 through 9<br>
6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;<br>
7 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:<br>
8 (For that righteous man dwelling amongst them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)<br>
9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgement to be punished:<br>
<br>
NLT, 2 Peter 2, verses 6 through 10<br>
Later, God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and turned them into heaps of ashes. He made them an example of what will happen to ungodly people. But God also rescued Lot out of Sodom because he was a righteous man who was sick of the shameful immorality of the wicked people around him. Yes, Lot was a righteous man who was tormented in his soul by the wickedness he saw and heard day after day. So you see, the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials, even whilst keeping the wicked under punishment until the day of final judgement. He is especially hard on those who follow their own twisted sexual desire, and who despise authority.<br>
<br>
Again, KJV and NLT both say that Lot was a "righteous man."  There was no recording of Lot doing anything right, but he is now Righteous Lot.<br>
<br>
Why?   Again, here's why...<br>
Ephesians 2 (KJV)<br>
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
<br>
Lot was saved, not because of who he was, but, because of whose he was.  He belonged to the Lord.<br>
<br>
Lot was vexed and tormented by the conversations, what he saw and what he heard.<br>
What would that look like today?  Conversations?  Sights?  Sounds?  Videos?  Radio stations?  Websites? Social Media?  YouTube? NetFlix? Adult movies? Explicit songs? Porn? Sexting?<br>
<br>
Lot could have used some advice from the book of Psalms.  Too bad it had not yet been written.  Looking again at what we saw earlier, in Psalms 101...<br>
<br>
Psalms 101, verses 3 and 4<br>
3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes (I will set no thing of Belial before mine eyes): I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.<br>
4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.<br>
<br>
How did he go from being a man of no recorded good works to Righteous Lot?<br>
<br>
One more time...<br>
Ephesians 2 (KJV)<br>
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2, NLT, verses 8, 9, and 10...<br>
NLT:
God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can't take credit for this; it is a gift from God. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:14<br>
KJV:
But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
As for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that cross, because of him, my interest in this world has been crucified, and the world's interest in me has also died.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Be sensitive to the Lord's leading. Let him lead you and guide you.  He will lead you to situations and opportunities when you can be a Doer of the word.<br>
But, instead of having your eyes and ears vexed by the sights and sounds of the world, like we saw there with Lot, instead of that, keep your eyes and ears tuned into the Lord through prayer. He may give you provision, opportunity and desire to be a Doer, but He may sometimes tell you to not be a Doer with some people and in some situations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7:6 (KJV)<br>
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT:
"Don't give the sacred to dogs. Don't waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Don't throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.<br>
<br>
A Doer gets his or her ability to be a doer through Jesus. <br>
I pray that the Lord Jesus will help us not fail to be a doer when we should be, and Jesus will not let us be a doer when we should not be.<br>
<br>
John 15:5 (KJV) Jesus says...<br>
...without me ye can do nothing.<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:13<br>
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. <br>
<br>
In conclusion, dear Lord Jesus, help us not fail to be a doer when we should be, and do not let us be a doer when we should not be.<br>
Help us read the Bible, study the Bible, understand the Bible, and actually do what the Bible tells us to do.<br>
Show me each day what I can do for you, for your glory, for your kingdom, and for your purposes. <br>
In Jesus name, Amen.  So be it.  Let it become true.  Hallelujah!<br>

The Christian rock band, Newsboys, released a song titled, "We Believe"<br>
It is available on their 16th studio album, Restart, which was released on 10 September 2013.<br>
Take a look at the lyrics...<br>
<br>
<br>
In this time of desperation<br>
When all we know is doubt and fear<br>

We believe in the crucifixion<br>
We believe that He conquered death<br>
We believe in the resurrection<br>
And He's comin' back again<br>
We believe<br>

So, let our faith be more than anthems<br>
Greater than the songs we sing<br>
And in our weakness and temptations<br>
We believe, We believe<br>

<br>
Let the lost be found and the dead be raised<br>
In the here and now, let love invade<br>

Aaron Shust had an interesting song on his album titled, Anything Worth Saying, which was released on 11 October 2005.<br>
Check out the lyrics to the song, Matchless, by Aaron Shust...<br>
<br>
<br>
Son of Man, Great I am, King of heaven<br>
Son of God, you hold the measure of my days<br>
Holy Lamb, spotless Lamb<br>
You are worthy, I am not<br>
Before Your throne I stand amazed<br>
<br>
<br>
Wonderful Counsellor<br>
Root of David, morning star<br>
You are the way, the truth, the life<br>
Lion of the tribe of Judah<br>
Mighty God is who you are<br>
The only perfect sacrifice<br>
<br>
Every tongue confess and every knee will bow<br>
To Jesus Christ the Lord forever, hear our praises now<br>
<br>
Your name is matchless<br>
Your name is priceless<br>
Your name means more than I could know<br>
You're so far above me<br>
The way that you love me<br>
Goes further than any love could go<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In your name you took the blind man<br>
And you gave him back his sight<br>
In your name you took the dead man<br>
And you brought him back to life<br>
In your name you took this prisoner<br>
And you opened up the doors<br>
And I will sing before your throne<br>
Forevermore<br>
<br>
Your name is matchless<br>
Your name is priceless<br>
Your name means more than I could know<br>
You're so far above me<br>
The way that you love me<br>
Goes further than any love could go<br>
<br>

<br>
This is a Christian Church Service. This is a Bible Study, where we study and learn about our Father in Heaven, our Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty, Holy God, Messiah, Lord, Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Warning!<br>
Some parts of the Bible contain strong adult content that may not be suitable for young children.<br>
Some people may find Bible studies to be offensive, and those people may respond with legal actions (lawsuits) or illegal, criminal actions.<br>
Some governments in some countries may have passed laws that make owning or reading a Bible to be illegal in certain places, and make take actions against those participants, resulting in prison, torture or death.<br>
Some of the content in a Bible study may contain Bible verse readings, quotations, commentaries, details and descriptions that may be considered graphic, sexually-explicit, disturbing or upsetting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the beginning of a Christian Church Service. We will be experiencing content that focuses on God, The Lord, The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Yahweh, <br>
Yeshiva (pronounced "Yeh-shoe-uh"), Jesus Christ, and The Holy Spirit. <br>
<br>
Our goal is to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to receive, accept and believe in our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, to be saved and forgiven, to receive the free gift of eternal life, to meet the Lord, learn about the Lord, get closer to the Lord, become more like the Lord, tune in and focus on his name, his nature, his plan and purpose, and receive direction, correction, instruction, love, mercy, grace, salvation, eternal life, forgiveness, loving-kindness, healing, provision, wisdom, knowledge, skill, understanding, revelation, discernment, protection, blessing and cleansing, all for his kingdom, his purposes, his pleasure and his glory.  We therefore ask Him to help us put ourselves into alignment with His purposes, desires and priorities, so that He may accomplish all of this in us, and also equip us with the capability and opportunity to do all of this, and more, in others.<br>
<br>
<br>
We hope and pray that everything we say and do here in this Christian church service, including all comments, commentaries, prayers, Bible studies, and conversations, will all be in alignment with the Bible, with what the Bible teaches, and the name and nature of Jesus Christ.  May we all stay far away from any content that may be in direct opposition to what the Bible says, and that this church service and all fellowship, prayers, advice and conversations would not dispense anything that would be in direct opposition to the Bible, Christianity, and what Jesus Christ and the Bible teach us.  If such mistakes were to occur, we hope and pray that the Lord would immediately reveal such false teachings, and let us have immediate repentance, correction and forgiveness.  We are not perfect, but we are perfectly forgiven, and we will try our best, sometimes imperfectly, to point us all to the one who is perfect, who is lights and perfection, for He will make us perfect, and we will become perfect in His eyes, through the salvation of Jesus Christ and believing in Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
We will be studying the Holy Bible, we will talk about the importance of reading your Bible, and praying, every single day, and we will have music, singing, prayer, rituals, traditions and ceremonies here that are Christian-based, focused on God, referring to, or having symbols and reminders of God, to help us remember God and what He has done, pointing to God, the Lord, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Bible.<br>
<br>
Much of Christian content that we present, may be divided into seven main categories<br>
<br>
The Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, our Heavenly Father, our Father in Heaven<br>
Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, the Son of God<br>
The Holy Spirit, or, the Holy Ghost<br>
The Holy Bible, The Word of God,  and the various English translations thereof<br>
Praying<br>
Heaven<br>
Hell<br>
<br>
The Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, our Heavenly Father, our Father in Heaven<br>
We believe that The Lord is the only wise, true and living God.  The Lord actually is real and exists, and there is no other god in existence except the Lord, our Heavenly Father.  He is our good and perfect father, He is on the throne, He is in control, He is the King of all the Earth, He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.  He is our father and we are his sons and daughters.  He is our friend.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, the Son of God<br>
We Believe that Jesus Christ and God are one and the same.  We believe that there is no other name and no other way to be saved, forgiven, and live forever, for all eternity in Heaven except by receiving, accepting, and believing in the name of Jesus Christ, and that Jesus Christ is Lord, and that Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and that God raised him up from the grave.  We believe this to be true, and as a result, we are saved and forgiven, and will live forever in Heaven, by simply believing in Jesus, as explained to us in Romans 10:9, and other passages.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Holy Spirit, or, the Holy Ghost<br>
We believe that the Holy Spirit is our comforter and our advocate.  We believe that the holy spirit guides us into all truth, and that God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the holy Spirit are all one and the same, thereby making God a three-in-one trinity. We believe that God is a trinity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Holy Bible, The Word of God,  and the various English translations thereof<br>
We believe that The Holy Bible became flesh and dwelt among us.  We believe that the Holy Bible is absolutely and completely true, all of it, everything in the Old Testament and the New Testament, and everything that it says about heaven and hell.  All of Gods commandments are true and are in full effect, and the instructions on how to be saved, forgiven and live forever in Heaven are also true and in full effect. We know that no one can perfectly think, imagine, say and do all of God's commandments, which is why we all need Jesus in order to be saved and be made perfect and right with God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Praying<br>
We believe that it is important to pray every day.  We are to never stop praying. As Christians, we pray and ask for things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in Jesus' name, calling on his name and his nature.  When we pray, we can pray like Moses did.  When Moses prayed to God, he simply talked to God as though he was talking to his friend. In prayer, we can praise Him, we can thank Him, and tell Him all of the things that we are thankful for, we can confess our sins to Him, and then we can thankfully receive His forgiveness, we can pray for churches and missions, we can pray for our needs, and we can pray for the needs of others. We believe that prayer is real, and that the Lord Jesus really and truly will listen to and respond to our prayers.  He will answer our prayers, even if sometimes the answer may not be the answer that we were hoping for or expecting. He may answer and respond to prayers using ways, methods, people, situations and other unexpected means, and may do so in His timing, not ours. We need to accept and follow His decisions and His leadership, even if our prayers do not appear to be answered, or are not answered according to our personal definition of what we think would be "fast enough or soon enough" and we need to accept and follow His decisions and His leadership even if our prayers are answered in a completely different or unexpected way that we were not anticipating.  We believe that God will always do his best if we leave the choices up to Him, and to be careful to make sure that God's will should always supersede our personal preferences and our personal interpretations of what we think is right or important.  Therefore we need to be careful in how we pray that we do not limit God by the way how we word our prayers.  May God's will be done and his perfect plan be carried out, in spite of what we may pray.<br>
<br>
<br>
On one hand, being careful how you pray is important, but another perspective would be, even a simple prayer will work, because the Lord sees your heart behind the matter, and knows what you're trying to say even if the words don't come out right in your prayer.<br>
<br>
He knows what you mean, even if you can't figure out how to say it right, or pray it out into the right words.<br>
<br>
Here is a Prayer in the Bible that actually worked and was answered perfectly...<br>
<br>
You should remember this prayer. It worked for Peter, and it will also work for you.<br>
<br>
Matthew 14:30 (KJV)<br>
Lord, save me.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Save me, Lord!<br>
<br>
Commentary:  He did not even say, Amen! Notice how he did not have to explain the situation, and Jesus totally helped him and answered his prayer perfectly.<br>
<br>
In case you were wondering about the story, it's in Matthew 14.<br>
<br>
KJV:<br>
When Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him.<br>
NLT:<br>
Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. But when he saw the strong wind and the waves, he was terrified and began to sink. "Save me, Lord!" he shouted. Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another prayer that became one thousand perfectly worded paragraphs of perfect prayer...<br>
<br>
A Groan! (Make a nice, long, 5 second groaning sound, as you think about something or someone that needs prayer.)<br>
<br>
Prayer topics - (things to pray about, or groan about): Praise Him, Thank Him (what you are thankful for), Confess Sin to Him and ask for forgiveness (I thankfully receive your forgiveness),<br>
Pray for churches and missions, pray for your needs, and pray for the needs of others.<br>
<br>
Don't know what to say?  Just say it all in nice, long groan.<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 26 & 27 (KJV)<br>
26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.<br>
27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
26 And the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness. For example, we don't know what God wants us to pray for. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words. <br>
27 And the Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers (the Spirit pleads for God's holy people) in harmony with God's own will. <br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: he maketh intercession for the saints -- The Holy Sprit maketh intercession for the Christians, the believers, those that are saved.<br>
All saved, believing Christians that have done Romans 10:9 are saints. If you study the original Greek word for a saint, it describes a saved Christian.<br>
When you are saved, and the Lord looks at you and your heart, he sees someone who is saved, forgiven, clean, holy, perfect and righteous. He sees Jesus living in your heart. <br>
Congratulations.  If you're a Christian, you are also a saint.<br>

<br>
<br>
Heaven<br>
We believe that Heaven is a real place, and that, by receiving, accepting and believing in Jesus Christ as our true God, Lord, Deliverer and Saviour, we believe that we will not die, but will instead live forever in Heaven in a mansion or dwelling place that Jesus has prepared for us, so that we may live with him and be with him forever. It is very easy for us to enter into heaven because Jesus paid the price and did all of the work that needed to be done so that we can be saved and forgiven.  He will wipe away every tear from our eye, he will take away all of the pain that we have suffered here on this Earth, and our sins and mistakes will be forgiven and completely forgotten forever.  We will see God face to face, we will become like God, and live in a new and perfect body forever in Heaven.  Romans 10:9 provides quick and easy instructions on how to make sure we are saved, forgiven and will live forever in Heaven, where we shall forever experience righteousness, perfection, peace and joy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hell<br>
We are sad to say that, according to the Bible, there is an actual real place called hell. The Bible talks more about hell than it does about Heaven.  The work that Jesus did on the cross resulted in making it easy for anyone to go to Heaven, by doing something as quick and simple as doing what it says in Romans 10:9. That free gift of salvation and eternal life is an offer that is available for everyone on the entire planet, for God so loved the world, the entire world.  Christ died once for all so that none should perish.  Unfortunately, the Bible indicates that most of the people on this Earth do not want to go to heaven.  They want to actually spend forever in an actual, real place called Hell. We believe that Hell is an actual, real place, where most people will spend all of eternity. Hell is described as darkness and a lake of fire at the same time, which would be scientifically a description of radiation heat.  It is a heat so incredibly hot that it does not produce any visible light. The Bible described radiation heat many centuries before scientists understood of its existence. No one needs to spend forever in hell.  There is an easy way to make sure we do not end up there, and that way is Jesus Christ.<br>

This Bible, printed by the Tyndale House Publishers, has a section in the front, called, the Tyndale Bible Verse Finder.<br>
They look at many dozens of topics, and find Bible verses that touch upon those topics, then they make a short, paraphrased summary that is supposed to briefly summarise what would be read if you were to turn to that Bible verse.<br>
<br>
There are many, many topics that the Bible addresses, but I would like to share with you the summarised statements that the Tyndale Bible Verse Finder gave for the main topics that we are looking at here in this Bible Study.<br>

Again, some of the main topics that are talked about in almost every church service would be...<br>

<br>
<br>
Those were paraphrased summaries of actual Bible verses.  The summaries were published in the Holy Bible, People's Parallel Edition,<br>
Printed by the Tyndale House Publishers in 1997.<br>
<br>
I would like to point out that, they did have many more topics in addition to the ones that we looked at here.<br>
They are paraphrased summaries of Bible verses, and not actual, direct quotes.<br>
I say this because, I was disappointed a few times by some of their summary statements.  I would argue that a few of their summaries did not accurately communicate the original Bible verse that they were supposed to be referring to.<br>
<br>
A few of those summaries contained interpretations of someone's attempt to understand the verse, and did not directly communicate the original meaning and message of the actual Bible verse.<br>
<br>
That's why it's always better to read the verses, chapters and stories directly out of the Bible, instead of trying to condense and summarise it down.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
I have a thing called, the 10-minute rule.  If a pastor talks more than 10 minutes without actually quoting or reading a verse directly out of Bible, watch out, as he may start to go off track and lose his accuracy and precision, and as a result, he may start to say things that may not be in alignment with what the Bible teaches.<br>
<br>
Is this a Bible study, or is this a survey of contemporary literature, quoting all sorts of famous authors and people, but not actually reading quotes directly out of the Bible?<br>
<br>
<br>
We finish-up this Bible Study now, with one quick look at some scripture, followed by a short prayer.<br>
<br>
This spot right here in the book of Matthew, chapter 28, is commonly referred to as, The Great Commission...<br>
<br>
Matthew 28 (KJV) -- verses 18, 19, and 20, the last three verses of Chapter 28...<br>
18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.<br>
19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br>
20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 28 (NLT) verses 18 through 20...<br>
18 Jesus came and told his disciples, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. <br>
19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations (all peoples,) baptising them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. <br>
20 Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age."<br>
<br>
<br>
And now, in the name of Jesus, let us pray...<br>
Lord, Jesus, help us keep the main thing the main thing, and help us keep our focus on<br>
The Lord, God<br>
Jesus Christ, <br>
The Holy Spirit,<br>
The Holy Bible, <br>
Praying<br>
Heaven<br>
Hell<br>
<br>
Help us keep our focus, our church service and our Bible Study on Jesus Christ and Him crucified.  Nothing more, nothing less, and nothing else.<br>
In Jesus name,<br>
Amen!<br>
<br>
