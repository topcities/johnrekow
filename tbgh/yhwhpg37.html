Did Goliath have any brothers? Yes, he did. Goliath and his brothers can be found here:<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 21:18-22 (NIV):<br>
"In the course of time, there was a war with the Philistines at Gob. At that time, Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of the giants. In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod. In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He also was descended from the giants. When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him. These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men."<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 20:4-8 (NIV):<br>
"In the course of the war against the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath, who was from Gath. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's rod. In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha. When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him. These were the descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
These passages indicate that Goliath had brothers who were also giants, specifically mentioning that Lahmi was a brother of Goliath. The term "descendants of Rapha" refers to the giants, which implies that Goliath and his brothers were part of this lineage.<br>
<br>
<br>
The identification of the individuals mentioned in the passages as brothers of Goliath is based on the context and wording used in the biblical texts. Here's how the connections are made:<br>
<br>
Contextual Clues:<br>
In both 2 Samuel 21:18-22 and 1 Chronicles 20:4-8, the narrative discusses battles involving the Philistines and mentions Goliath specifically. The passages refer to other giants who are described as being from Gath, the same city as Goliath, and they are noted as descendants of Rapha, which is a term often associated with giants.<br>
<br>
Direct Mention:<br>
In 1 Chronicles 20:4, it explicitly states that Elhanan killed "Lahmi the brother of Goliath." This direct mention establishes a familial relationship.<br>
<br>
Similar Descriptions:<br>
The other giants mentioned in these passages are described in ways that align with the characteristics of Goliath, such as their size and lineage. This suggests they are part of the same family or group of giants.<br>
<br>
Repetition of Themes:<br>
The mention of multiple giants in the context of battles against Israel, along with the specific reference to Goliath's brother, reinforces the idea that these individuals are related.<br>
<br>
Whilst the texts do not provide a detailed family tree, the combination of these contextual clues and direct references leads to the conclusion that the giants mentioned in these passages are indeed brothers or close relatives of Goliath.<br>
<br>
<br>
Based on these biblical accounts, here is a list of Goliath and his four brothers:<br>
<br>
1. Goliath - The most well-known giant, defeated by David.<br>
2. Lahmi - Specifically mentioned as the brother of Goliath in 1 Chronicles 20:4.<br>
3. Saph - Mentioned in 2 Samuel 21:18 as one of the giants killed by David's men.<br>
4. Ishbi-Benob - Also mentioned in 2 Samuel 21:16 as a giant who sought to kill David.<br>
5. Another unnamed giant - Described in 2 Samuel 21:20 as a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, who was also a descendant of the giants.<br>
<br>
These names and descriptions are derived from the passages in 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles, which discuss the battles with the Philistines and the giants associated with Goliath.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible, the verse that describes David selecting smooth stones before fighting Goliath is found in 1 Samuel 17:40. Here is the verse:<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 17:40 (KJV):<br>
("And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the valley, and put them in a shepherd's vessell which he had,)<br>
"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Perhaps David chose five smooth stones before facing Goliath, because Goliath had four brothers, which would be a total of five giants known to be in the region.<br>
<br>
The reason David chose five smooth stones before facing Goliath is not explicitly stated in the biblical text, so interpretations vary. Some scholars and commentators suggest that David may have selected five stones in anticipation of facing not only Goliath but also his brothers, as there are references to multiple giants associated with Goliath.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, David only needed one stone to defeat Goliath, which emphasises his faith in God rather than reliance on physical weapons.<br>
<br>
We only need one stone to defeat our enemy, and that stone is our chief cornerstone, the head stone of the corner, our firm foundation, the rock that travelled with them, standing in the shadow of a great rock in a weary land, the solid rock on which I stand. Who set me up upon a rock?<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:5 -- KJV<br>
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27: 4 & 5 -- NLT<br>
4<br>
The one thing I ask of the Lord --<br>
the thing I seek most --<br>
is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,<br>
delighting in the Lord's perfections<br>
and meditating in his Temple.<br>
5<br>
For he will conceal me there when troubles come;<br>
he will hide me in his sanctuary.<br>
He will place me out of reach on a high rock.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 32:2 -- KJV<br>
And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 62:1 -- KJV<br>
Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 31:3 -- KJV<br>
For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 95:1 -- KJV<br>
O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 18:2 -- KJV<br>
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.<br>

<br>
There was a 1967 song that became very popular in 1969.<br>
It was called, "Oh Happy Day."<br>
The original version was first released in 1755,<br>
coming from clergyman Philip Doddridge. That 1755 hymn was then put to music<br>
that was originally released in 1704 by Johann Anastasius Freylinghausen (1670 - 1739).<br>
<br>
The melody was then modified in 1854 by Edward Rimbault,<br>
and his version had the title, O Happy Day, That Fixed My Choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
The exact year Philip Doddridge wrote the hymn "Oh, Happy Day"<br>
is not definitively documented.<br>
However, it is believed that he composed the text<br>
in the early 18th century, likely around the 1730s.<br>
<br>
<br>
The hymn "Oh, Happy Day" is often attributed to Philip Doddridge,<br>
but it was actually published posthumously.<br>
Doddridge wrote the text of the hymn,<br>
but it was not released until after his death in 1751.<br>
The hymn was included in a collection of his works that was published in 1755.<br>
<br>
So, whilst Doddridge did not release the hymn himself,<br>
his work was compiled and published by others after his passing.<br>
<br>
<br>
To summarise this again,<br>
The original 1755 lyrics were published four years after the death of English Nonconformist, Congregationalist, minister, educator, and hymnwriter, Philip Doddridge (1702 - 1751).<br>
It may have been written sometime during the 1730s, but the exact year is unknown.<br>
The added 1854 lyrics were by British organist, musicologist, book collector and author Edward Rimbault (1816 - 1876),<br>
and the popular 1967 arrangement and lyrics were created by American gospel musician, pianist, vocalist, choir master, composer, and arranger Edwin Hawkins (1943 - 2018).<br>
<br>
<br>
Edwin Hawkins was one of the originators of the urban contemporary gospel sound.<br>
As the leader of the Edwin Hawkins Singers, he was probably best known for his 1967 arrangement of "Oh Happy Day."<br>
<br>
<br>
The song is based on the story found in the Book of Acts 8:26-40.<br>
<br>
Here is a short summary of this story found in Acts 8:26-40.<br>
<br>
The angel of the Lord instructs Philip to travel south to Gaza. There, he encounters an Ethiopian eunuch, a high official reading the book of Isaiah. Philip approaches him and asks if he understands what he is reading. The eunuch invites Philip to explain, leading to a discussion about Jesus. As they travel, they come across water, and the eunuch requests baptism.<br>
<br>
Philip baptises him, and suddenly, the Spirit of the Lord takes Philip away.<br>
<br>
The eunuch continues his journey rejoicing, whilst Philip suddenly finds himself in Azotus, preaching the gospel in various towns until he reaches Caesarea.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dorothy Combs Morrison is an American gospel music singer.<br>
She sang the lead vocal on the song "Oh Happy Day" recorded in 1967 by the Edwin Hawkins Singers.<br>
The 1967 recording was made at the Ephesian Church of God in Christ, in Berkeley, California.<br>
<br>
Berkeley, California, is on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay.<br>
Berkeley is about 13 miles east of San Francisco, and about 5 miles north of the city of Oakland, California.<br>
<br>
The 1967 recording was first released outside of the United States in 1968.<br>
After it was eventually released in the United States, in April of 1969, it became one of the most popular songs of 1969.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, the song was also known as, "O Happy Day That Fixed My Choice" when it was released in 1854.<br>
<br>
Here are now the words to the song, Oh Happy Day.<br>
This reading will include the<br>
1755 lyrics written by Philip Doddridge,<br>
the added 1854 lyrics by Edward Rimbault,<br>
and the 1967 lyrics added by Edwin Hawkins, and made famous by Dorothy Morrison and The Edwin Hawkins Singers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
O happy day, that fixed my choice<br>
On thee, my Saviour and my God!<br>
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,<br>
And tell its raptures all abroad.<br>
<br>
<br>
O happy bond,<br>
that seals my vows To Him<br>
Who merits all my love!<br>
Let cheerful anthems fill His house,<br>
While to that sacred shrine I move.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
'Tis done, the great transaction's done:<br>
I am my Lord's, and he is mine;<br>
He drew me, and I followed on,<br>
Charmed to confess the voice divine.<br>
<br>
<br>
'Tis done -- the great transaction's done;<br>
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;<br>
He drew me and I followed on,<br>
Rejoiced to own the call divine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now rest, my long-divided heart;<br>
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest,<br>
Nor ever from thy Lord depart;<br>
With him of every good possessed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now rest, my long-divided heart,<br>
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest;<br>
Here have I found a nobler part;<br>
Here heav'nly pleasures fill my breast.<br>
<br>
<br>
High heav'n, that heard the solemn vow,<br>
That vow renewed shall daily hear,<br>
Till in life's latest hour I bow,<br>
And bless in death a bond so dear.<br>
<br>

Song of Solomon - Song of Songs 2:1 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
I am the rose of the field, and the lily of the valleys.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In the Geneva Bible margin notes, it says that,<br>
The Church defines the rest of the book (of the Song of Solomon - Song of Songs)<br>
as being under the shadow of Christ.<br>
She heareth his voice.<br>
She is compared to the dove, and the enemies to the foxes.<br>

Isaiah's Prayer for Zion and Jerusalem...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 62:4 -- NLT<br>
Never again will you be called "The Forsaken City"<br>
or "The Desolate Land."<br>
<br>
(Never again will you be called "forsaken"<br>
or "desolate.")<br>
<br>
(Never again will you be called "Azubah"<br>
or "Shemamah.")<br>
<br>
<br>
Your new name will be "The City of God's Delight"<br>
and "The Bride of God,"<br>
<br>
(Your new name will be "My Delight Is In Her"<br>
and "Married,")<br>
<br>
(Your new name will be "Hephzibah"<br>
and "Beulah,")<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: The land will be called, Beulah, according to Isaiah 62:4.<br>
In the song that we will be looking at next,<br>
there is a mention about going sightseeing in Beulah, one of the new names for Zion and Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes, in the English language, the greeting,<br>
"How do you do?" from the 16th century,<br>
eventually became "Howdy-do" in the 19th century,<br>
which eventually was shortened to "Howdy"<br>
and became popular in the American West.<br>
"Howdy" is an informal way of saying "Hello."<br>
<br>
<br>
As of July of 2025, that song, Oh Happy Day<br>
by The Edwin Hawkins Singers<br>
was the number two best-selling gospel song of all time.<br>
<br>
What is the number one<br>
best-selling gospel song of all time?<br>
<br>
It is a 1947 recording by Mahalia Jackson.<br>
The song is titled, Move On Up a Little Higher.<br>
<br>
It was released as a single, in the form of a 10-inch phonographic record<br>
that spun at 78 revolutions per minute (78 RPM).<br>
<br>
The maximum recording time was typically around 3 to 4 minutes per side,<br>
which is why the recording has a brief, silent moment, as Side A ended,<br>
and then the song continued on Side B.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mahalia Jackson (1911 - 1972).<br>
She was an American gospel singer,<br>
widely considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century.<br>
With a career spanning 40 years, Jackson was integral to the development and spread<br>
of gospel blues in black churches throughout the United States.<br>
<br>
"Move On Up a Little Higher" is a gospel song written by W. Herbert Brewster,<br>
first recorded by Brother John Sellers in late 1946,<br>
and then most famously recorded on 12 September 1947,<br>
by gospel singer Mahalia Jackson,<br>
whose version sold eight million copies and<br>
as of July of 2025, it still is the number one best-selling gospel song of all time.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Easter<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Bunny is a child's word for a rabbit.<br>
A bunny is a rabbit.<br>
A rabbit is a small animal with long ears and soft fur, that lives in a hole in the ground.<br>
A rabbit is a small, burrowing, herbivorous mammal belonging to the same family as the hare.<br>
A hare is an animal like a rabbit, but larger, which can run very quickly.<br>
A hare is a herbivorous mammal like a rabbit but slightly larger and with longer legs and ears.<br>
A hare is an animal like a large rabbit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 11:6 -- KJV<br>
And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 11:6 -- NLT<br>
The hare chews the cud but does not have split hooves, so it is unclean.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 11:6 -- TS2009<br>
and the hare, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is unclean to you;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- KJV<br>
And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison,<br>
and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him;<br>
intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Greek word that was translated into the English word, Easter, is pronounced, Poss-Ha.<br>
It means, Passover.<br>
<br>
<br>
Today, the Greek word for Passover is pronounced,<br>
Ev-Rake-Oh-Pask-Ha<br>
<br>
<br>
This Greek word, Poss-Ha,<br>
is found in the New Testament 29 times.<br>
All of the other 28 of the 29 occurrences all choose the English word, Passover.<br>
<br>
Why does Acts 12:4 say, Easter, instead of Passover?<br>
The Greek word even sounds similar to the Hebrew word for Passover, which is Pay-Sock.<br>
Hebrew word: Pay-Sock<br>
Greek word: Poss-Ha<br>
<br>
Why did the KJV translation team choose the word Easter in Acts 12:4?<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- NLT<br>
Then he imprisoned him, placing him under the guard<br>
of four squads of four soldiers each.<br>
Herod intended to bring Peter out for public trial after the Passover.<br>
<br>
-- NLT says that it is Passover and not Easter. --<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- TS-2009<br>
So when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to watch over him, intending to bring him before the people after Pay-Sock (the Hebrew word for Passover).<br>
<br>
-- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) says that it is Passover and not Easter. --<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
And when he had caught him, he put him in prison,<br>
and delivered him to foure quaternions of soldiers to be kept,<br>
intending after the Passover to bring him foorth to the people.<br>
<br>
-- Geneva Bible also says that it is Passover and not Easter. --<br>
<br>
(Geneva Bible 1560 margin note: As for the foure quaternions of soldiers,<br>
the number being sixteen was divided by fours, to keep divers wards.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- NIV<br>
After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.<br>
<br>
-- NIV also says that it is Passover and not Easter. --<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- New American Standard Bible (NASB 1995)<br>
When he had seized him, he put him in prison,<br>
delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him,<br>
intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people.<br>
<br>
-- NASB 1995 also says that it is Passover and not Easter. --<br>
<br>
Five other English translation teams are all saying the the KJV has performed a complete failure in the accuracy of their translation of Acts 12:4.<br>
<br>
Again, I ask, why did the KJV translation team choose the word Easter in Acts 12:4?<br>
Is it a stupid mistake, or an intentional lie inserted into the KJV by satanic people?<br>
<br>
This is why it is always a good idea to study the Bible in more than one English translation.<br>
Don't stay stuck in only one single English translation. In a multitude of counsellors there is safety.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is an interesting commentary about this argument and discussion.<br>
This article is published by Chick Publications.<br>
Chick Publications is best known for Chick cartoon tracts.<br>
<br>
A tract is a short pamphlet or booklet that conveys a religious message, often used for evangelism.<br>
Chick cartoon tracts are illustrated pamphlets created by Jack Chick, featuring comic-style narratives<br>
that promote Christian beliefs and often address moral issues.<br>
Founded in 1974, Chick Publications gained prominence for its distinctive, often controversial tracts that blend humour and serious themes.<br>
The tracts cover various topics, including salvation, sin, and societal issues,<br>
and have been translated into multiple languages. Despite criticism for their confrontational style,<br>
Chick tracts have reached millions, making them a significant part of evangelical outreach.<br>
<br>
Samuel C. Gipp is an American author and evangelist known for his work in Christian literature, particularly in having reasoned arguments or writings in defence of the Bible.<br>
He gained prominence with his 1989 book, "The Answer Book -- A Helpbook for Christians,"<br>
which addresses common questions and challenges faced by Christians.<br>
Gipp is also recognised for his advocacy of the King James Version of the Bible,<br>
and has written extensively on its significance.<br>
His writings often focus on defending the faith and providing resources for believers to strengthen their understanding of Christianity.<br>
<br>
Again, Samuel C. Gipp is the author of the 1989 book, "The Answer Book -- A Helpbook for Christians."<br>
The following selected content comes from that book.<br>
Here are some selected quotations taken from the Samuel C. Gipp's book, and placed into this 1989 article, titled,<br>
Isn't "Easter" a Mistranslation of "Pascha" (Poss-Ha) and Should It Be Translated As "Passover"?<br>
As of July of 2025, this quoted material was found on this Chick Publications webpage...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.chick.com/Information/article?id=Isnt-Easter-A-Mistranslation-of-Pascha">https://www.chick.com/Information/article?id=Isnt-Easter-A-Mistranslation-of-Pascha</a><br>
<br>
Here are now some selected paragraphs being quoted from this 1989 commentary found on that Chick Publications webpage...<br>
<br>
The many opponents to the concept of having a perfect Bible have made much of this translation of "pascha" (Poss-Ha).<br>
<br>
Coming to the word "Easter" in (the KJV,) God's Authorised Bible, they seize upon it imagining that they have found proof that the Bible is not perfect. Fortunately for lovers of the word of God, they are wrong.<br>
<br>
Easter, as we know it, comes from the ancient pagan festival of Astarte. Also known as Ishtar (pronounced "Easter"). This festival has always been held late in the month of April. It was, in its original form, a celebration of the earth "regenerating" itself after the winter season.<br>
<br>
The festival involved a celebration of reproduction. For this reason the common symbols of Easter festivities were the rabbit (the same symbol as "Playboy" magazine), and the egg. Both are known for their reproductive abilities.<br>
<br>
At the centre of attention was Astarte, the female deity. She is known in the Bible as the "queen of heaven" (Jeremiah 7:18; Jeremiah 44:17-25). She is the mother of Tammuz (Ezekiel 8:14) who was also her husband! These perverted rituals would take place at sunrise on Easter morning (Ezekiel 8:13-16). From the references in Jeremiah and Ezekiel, we can see that the true Easter has never had any association with Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Problem: Even though the Jewish passover was held in mid April (the fourteenth) and the pagan festival Easter was held later the same month, how do we know that Herod was referring to Easter in Acts 12:4 and not the Jewish passover? If he was referring to the passover, the translation of "pascha" as "Easter" is incorrect. If he was indeed referring to the pagan holyday (holiday) Easter, then the King James Bible (1611) must truly be the very word and words of God for it is the only Bible in print today which has the correct reading.<br>
<br>
To unravel the confusion concerning "Easter" in verse 4, we must consult our FINAL authority, THE BIBLE.<br>
<br>
It must also be noted that whenever the passover is mentioned in the New Testament, the reference is always to the meal, to be eaten on the night of April 14th not the entire week. The days of unleavened bread are NEVER referred to as the Passover. (It must be remembered that the angel of the Lord passed over Egypt on one night, not seven nights in a row.)<br>
<br>
Now let us look at (the KJV of) Acts 12:3,4: "And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people."<br>
<br>
Verse 3 shows that Peter was arrested during the days of unleavened bread (April 15-21). The Bible says: "Then were the days of unleavened bread." The passover (April 14th) had already come and gone. Herod could not possibly have been referring to the passover in his statement concerning Easter. The next Passover was a year away! But the pagan holiday of Easter was just a few days away. Remember! Herod was a pagan Roman who worshipped the "queen of heaven". He was NOT a Jew. He had no reason to keep the Jewish passover. Some might argue that he wanted to wait until after the passover for fear of upsetting the Jews. There are two grievous faults in this line of thinking.<br>
<br>
First, Peter was no longer considered a Jew. He had repudiated Judaism. The Jews would have no reason to be upset by Herod's actions.<br>
<br>
Second, he could not have been waiting until after the passover because he thought the Jews would not kill a man during a religious holiday. They had killed Jesus during passover (Matthew 26:17-19,47). They were also excited about Herod's murder of James. Anyone knows that a mob possesses the courage to do violent acts during religious festivities, not after.<br>
<br>
In further considering Herod's position as a Roman, we must remember that the Herods were well known for celebrating (Matthew 14:6-11). In fact, in Matthew chapter 14 we see that a Herod was even willing to kill a man of God during one of his celebrations.<br>
<br>
It is elementary to see that Herod, in Acts 12, had arrested Peter during the days of unleavened bread, after the passover. The days of unleavened bread would end on the 21st of April. Shortly after that would come Herod's celebration of pagan Easter. Herod had not killed Peter during the days of unleavened bread simply because he wanted to wait until Easter. Since it is plain that both the Jews (Matthew 26:17- 47) and the Romans (Matthew 14:6-11) would kill during a religious celebration, Herod's opinion seemed that he was not going to let the Jews "have all the fun ". He would wait until his own pagan festival and see to it that Peter died in the excitement.<br>
<br>
Thus we see that it was God's providence which had the Spirit-filled translators of our Bible (King James Version) to CORRECTLY translate "pascha" as "Easter". It most certainly did not refer to the Jewish passover. In fact, to change it to "passover" would confuse the reader and make the truth of the situation unclear.<br>
<br>
<br>
And that is the end of the commentary quoted from the 1989 article,<br>
Isn't "Easter" a Mistranslation of "Pascha" and Should It Be Translated As "Passover"?<br>
which comes from Samuel C. Gipp's 1989 book, "The Answer Book -- A Helpbook for Christians."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
We are only commanded to do the seven feasts, and Easter is not the same as Passover.<br>
Just try your best to study, guard, appreciate, celebrate, observe and do the Sabbath days of rest, and the seven feasts that are in the Bible, and have nothing to do with all of the other so-called special days that are observed in your country.<br>
The world will try to make you miscalculate the days, and then the world will try to get you to fail and forget all about the seven feasts.<br>

Random trivia:<br>
The earliest known reference to a Seder-like meal appears in the Mishnah, a compilation of Jewish oral laws completed around the year of 200 AD.<br>
Question. Why does The Chosen TV Series show Christ doing a Seder-like meal at Passover when the Seder-like meal did not exist until the year 200 AD?<br>
Answer. If it is not in the Bible, then it is not true. The Seder-like meal is not in the Bible. Do you know who those people are that are producing and making The Chosen TV Series? Do you know what they really believe in? There are clues hiding in the end credits. Be careful! Don't be deceived! Are those just movie props that they are providing, or are they charged objects?<br>

Commentary:<br>
One morning, in July of 2025, my wife was reading her KJV Bible,<br>
and she came across this little area in 2 Corinthians 1.<br>
If you take the word, Asia, and replace it with the city that we were living in at that time,<br>
it sounded like it was describing us, and our situation, and how we felt, being stuck there, in that place.<br>
<br>
If you take the city that you are living in right now,<br>
and you place your city name right in there, where it mentions Asia, is it also talking about you,<br>
and your situation, and how you feel, being stuck where you are right now?<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8 & 9 -- KJV<br>
1:8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:<br>
(But we had the answer of death in ourselves,)<br>
1:9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8 & 9 -- NLT<br>
(We think you ought to know, dear brothers,)<br>
8 We think you ought to know, dear brothers and sisters, about the trouble we went through in the province of Asia. We were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure, and we thought we would never live through it.<br>
9 In fact, we expected to die. But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God, who raises the dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8 & 9 -- TS2009<br>
8 For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brothers, of our pressure which came to us in Asia, that we were weighed down, exceedingly, beyond ability, so that we despaired even of life.<br>
9 Indeed, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in ELL-Low-Heem who raises the dead,<br>

Watch what happens when we read that again, but keep reading just two more verses after that.<br>

2 Corinthians 1: 8-11 -- KJV<br>
1:8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:<br>
(But we had the answer of death in ourselves,)<br>
1:9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:<br>
1:10 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;<br>
1:11 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8-11 -- NLT<br>
(We think you ought to know, dear brothers,)<br>
8 We think you ought to know, dear brothers and sisters, about the trouble we went through in the province of Asia. We were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure, and we thought we would never live through it.<br>
9 In fact, we expected to die. But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God, who raises the dead.<br>
10 And he did rescue us from mortal danger, and he will rescue us again. We have placed our confidence in him, and he will continue to rescue us.<br>
11 And you are helping us by praying for us. Then many people will give thanks because God has graciously answered so many prayers for our safety.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8-11 -- TS2009<br>
8 For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brothers, of our pressure which came to us in Asia, that we were weighed down, exceedingly, beyond ability, so that we despaired even of life.<br>
9 Indeed, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in ELL-Low-Heem who raises the dead,<br>
10 who rescued us from so great a death, and does rescue, in whom we trust that He shall still rescue us,<br>
11 you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks shall be given by many on our behalf for the favour bestowed upon us through many.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The summary and conclusion is, we need to keep praying for each other.<br>
When we pray for each other, we really are helping each other, and He is faithful to rescue us again and again.<br>

Psalms 34: 17-19 -- KJV<br>
34:17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.<br>
34:18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.<br>
34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34: 17-19 -- NLT<br>
17<br>
The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.<br>
He rescues them from all their troubles.<br>
18<br>
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted;<br>
he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.<br>
19<br>
The righteous person faces many troubles,<br>
but the Lord comes to the rescue each time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34 is a psalm of David, regarding the time he pretended to be insane in front of Abimelech, who sent him away.<br>
Psalms 34 is a Hebrew acrostic poem; each verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
In the TS2009 translation, at the beginning of each verse, there is an attempt to pronounce each letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
English words are being spelled here in such a way as to help pronounce those Hebrew letters and names more accurately.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34: 17-19 -- TS2009<br>
17 Saudi<br>
The righteous cried out, and Yaw-Who-Wah heard, And delivered them out of all their distresses.<br>
18 Koof<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah is near to the broken-hearted, And saves those whose spirit is crushed.<br>
19 Raysh<br>
Many are the evils of the righteous, But Yaw-Who-Wah delivers him out of them all.<br>

We have many Bible studies that quote a verse here and there out of Psalms Chapter 34.<br>
<br>
During a random moment about half-way into Christian Essays 5,<br>
which is also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 5,<br>
we did a Bible study by reading all of Psalms 34 in the KJV and NLT.<br>

In early August of 2025, my daughter was reading through the book of Isaiah in the KJV, and when she found these two Bible verses, she took a full sheet of paper, and coloured the entire paper a bright, sunny yellow colour, and then hand-wrote these two Bible verses with big letters, and then placed them on the fridge in the kitchen. Every morning, when I'm trying to start my day, when I see these two Bible verses, I read them again and again, and it cheers me up, and reminds me of His promises, and how much He loves us.<br>

Isaiah 33:6 -- KJV<br>
And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,<br>
(and strength of salvations:)<br>
and strength of salvation:<br>
(and strength of Yeh-Shoe-Uh:)<br>
the fear of the LORD is his treasure.<br>
<br>
<br>

Isaiah 33:6 -- NLT<br>
In that day he will be your sure foundation,<br>

<br>
Isaiah 33:6 -- TS2009<br>

for Yaw-Who-Wah is our Judge, Yaw-Who-Wah is our Inscriber,<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah is our Sovereign, He saves us --<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Just think about all of the things that are being mentioned in just these two Bible verses. He loads us up daily with His blessings and His benefits. He gives us wisdom and knowledge, He gives us stability and a firm foundation, He gives us strength, He gives us salvation, He gives us His son so that He can give us eternal life, everlasting life. He gives us His kingdom as an inheritance, because we are His children, and He is our perfect Father. He gives us the Fear of Yaw-Who-Wah, He gives us His set of instructions, His Torah. He is our king, and He promises to save us. In a world of chaos, confusion, insecurities and instabilities, He promises to be the stability of these times that we are in right now.<br>

<br>
Isaiah 53:3 -- KJV<br>
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief:<br>
<br>
and we hid as it were our faces from him;<br>
(and he hid as it were his face from us;)<br>
(and we hid as a hiding of faces from him;)<br>
(and he hid as a hiding of faces from us;)<br>
<br>
he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<br>
<br>
Let's look at that English word, esteemed.<br>
That English word is a translation from an ancient Hebrew word.<br>
The Hebrew word that was originally right there is pronounced, Haw-Shev.<br>
<br>
It is a Hebrew word that is found one hundred and twenty-four times in the Bible.<br>
This Hebrew word, Haw-Shev. What does it mean?<br>
<br>
<br>
We will once again quickly consult our usual references...<br>
<br>
Strong's Greek and Hebrew Dictionary and Tense, Voice, and Mood Definitions (also known as TVM Definitions)<br>
first published in 1890, by James Strong.<br>
<br>
A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,<br>
compiled by Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver, and Charles Augustus Briggs,<br>
first published in 1906, commonly known today as the Brown-Driver-Briggs definitions.<br>
<br>
Tyndale Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Hebrew (TBESH) published by Tyndale House, in Cambridge, England.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This Hebrew word, Haw-Shev.<br>
It can mean,<br>
esteem<br>
to think, plan, account<br>
to think to do, devise, plan<br>
value, regard<br>
to be imputed<br>
to be computed, be reckoned<br>
invent, make a judgement, imagine, count<br>
to think upon, consider, to be considered<br>
be mindful of.<br>
<br>
The English word, Esteem. What does that mean?<br>
We will look at the word definitions in the<br>
Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford dictionaries,<br>
as they were found to be back in August of 2025.<br>
<br>
The English word, Esteem. It means...<br>
a feeling of respect for someone, or a good opinion of someone,<br>
to value, respect or think highly of someone or something.<br>
high regard or respect, respected.<br>
respect for or a good opinion of someone<br>
to respect someone or something or have a good opinion of them<br>
to consider or believe someone or something to be a particular thing<br>
Esteem is the admiration and respect that you feel towards another person.<br>
If you esteem someone or something, you respect or admire them.<br>
great respect and approval; a good opinion of somebody.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
After looking over this information, if we esteemed him not<br>
it could mean that<br>
We did not esteem him,<br>
we did not think about who he really was.<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Isaiah, Chapter 53, is a prophecy about Jesus.<br>
This prophecy was written sometime around in the years from<br>
740 BC down to 700 BC (the BC years count down, backwards, because those numbers are below the year of zero.)<br>
Again, Isaiah, Chapter 53, was written sometime around 740 BC down to 700 BC,<br>
which is more than 700 years before Jesus was born.<br>
This was a big prophecy that all came true, written more than 700 years before it was supposed to happen.<br>
<br>
If I want to esteem Him right now, and I think about all of what these word definitions could mean,<br>
I need to<br>
think about him, and who He is, and what He did for me.<br>
I need to think about what His plans are for me.<br>
I need to value Him, consider Him, and what He wants me to do for Him.<br>
I need to me mindful of Him.<br>
I need to value Him and respect Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Think about that again. I need to value Him and respect Him.<br>
That reminds me of the Lord's Prayer.<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:9 (KJV)<br>
After this manner therefore pray ye:<br>
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<br>
<br>
Hallowed be thy name.<br>
What does that word, Hallowed, mean?<br>
<br>
Let's think about the Greek word right there that was translated into the English word, Hallowed.<br>
That Greek word there is pronounced, Haw-Key-Odd-Zoh.<br>
The K has more of a Guh sound, like the Guh sound in Goose.<br>
<br>
Haw-Key-Odd-Zoh. What does it mean?<br>
<br>
Since the New Testament is commonly referenced as being from the Greek,<br>
we will grab a few more reference books to look at here...<br>
<br>
We'll use again the Strong's Greek and Hebrew Dictionary and TVM Definitions,<br>
and we will consider what is in the<br>
Greek-English lexicon by John Jeffrey Dodson (2010)<br>
<br>
Strong's Greek Dictionary provided by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen from Michael Grier, published in 2012.<br>
<br>
Thayer's Lexicon, prepared by Alan Bunning, from the Centre for New Testament Restoration, published in 2013,<br>
based on the Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, which was first published in 1889 by Joseph Henry Thayer.<br>
<br>
and the Tyndale Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Greek (also known as the TBESG), first published in 2015.<br>
<br>
The Greek word, Haw-Key-Odd-Zoh. What does it mean?<br>
Let's put the definitions into the context of the prayer.<br>
<br>
Our Father in heaven,<br>
may your name be hallowed.<br>
<br>
Our Father in heaven,<br>
may your name be kept holy.<br>
may your name be holy<br>
Let us make your name holy.<br>
Let us sanctify your name.<br>
<br>
Your name I make holy, I treat as holy, I set apart as holy,<br>
I sanctify, hallow, purify your name.<br>
<br>
to hallow means to make holy, consecrate, sanctify<br>
to dedicate, separate, set apart for God<br>
to purify, make conformable in character to such dedication<br>
to treat as holy<br>
to separate from profane things and dedicate to God<br>
may we consecrate your name,<br>
dedicate your name, purify, cleanse your name.<br>
<br>
<br>
The English word, Hallowed. What does it mean?<br>
We will look at the word definitions in the<br>
Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford dictionaries,<br>
as they were found to be back in August of 2025.<br>
<br>
The English word, Hallowed.<br>
If we insert the dictionary definitions into the context of the Lord's Prayer,<br>
we get this...<br>
may your name be holy or made holy<br>
may your name be important and respected.<br>
May we make or regard your name as holy<br>
May we consecrate or set apart your name as being sacred.<br>
May your name be very respected and praised because of your great importance.<br>
May your name be respected and admired.<br>

Isaiah 53:3 -- NLT<br>
He was despised and rejected --<br>
a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief.<br>
We turned our backs on him and looked the other way.<br>
He was despised, and we did not care.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 53:3 -- TS2009<br>
despised and rejected by men, a man of pains and knowing sickness.<br>
And as one from whom the face is hidden, being despised,<br>
and we did not consider Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:9 -- NLT<br>
Pray like this:<br>
Our Father in heaven,<br>
may your name be kept holy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Hebrew word for holy is, Kah-Doe-Sh or Koh-Desh.<br>
The Hebrew word for "the" is pronounced Ha.<br>
The Holy, in Hebrew, would be Ha-Koh-Desh.<br>
Spirit of The Holy, is, Roo-Awk Ha-Koh-Desh.<br>
Spirit of The Holy is the Holy Spirit.<br>
Roo-Awk Ha-Koh-Desh is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of The Holy.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for holy, Kah-Doe-Sh or Koh-Desh,<br>
it means to be set apart, as if, to be set apart for a special purpose.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:9 -- TS2009<br>
"This, then, is the way you should pray: <br>
'Our Father who is in the heavens, let Your Name be set-apart,<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's now bring this Bible study to a conclusion with a quick prayer.<br>
<br>
Heavenly Father, our ELL-Low-Heem, The Lord of Hosts, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat,<br>
Beloved Son, our Master, our Ah-Doe-Nye, Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck,<br>
What do you want me to do for you today?<br>
How can I do a better job of loving you with all of my heart, mind, soul and strength?<br>
How can I do a better job of loving my neighbour and my family?<br>
Help us esteem you, and remember you, and consider your ways and your plans.<br>
Help us always put you and your name in a place of honour.<br>
Stop the sin, stop the lies, stop the sorrows, stop the bitterness.<br>
Let us have no more drinking of the wine of sorrows,<br>
and no more drinking of the wine of bitterness.<br>
Help me stop sinning, right now, and forever more. Help me stop thinking wrong thoughts.<br>
Heal me and my family. Heal me and save me from my past, from my mistakes, and from my failures.<br>
Heal us. Help us. Provide for us. Save us. Be our salvation. Be our Yeh-Shoe-Uh. In the name of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck,<br>
In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>

As my daughter was finishing her reading of the book of Isaiah once again,<br>
she was again very blessed by the many treasures that she found all throughout that book of Isaiah.<br>
Here is one place that she shared with me, in early September of 2025.<br>

Back in late August and early September of 2025,<br>
there were two popular Christian songs that really spoke to us about how we were feeling and<br>
the difficulties and struggles of the life that we were living at that time.<br>
<br>
The first song was from Jamie MacDonald.<br>
<br>
Jamie MacDonald is an American contemporary Christian pop singer-songwriter from Nashville, Tennessee.<br>
As of September of 2025, she had not yet released any albums.<br>
Her third single, titled, Desperate, was first released on 3 January 2025,<br>
and eventually peaked at number 10 on the Hot Christian Songs chart by Billboard magazine, on 12 April 2025.<br>
During that same week, it was the number one most popular song on the Christian Adult Contemporary chart, also published by Billboard magazine.<br>
<br>
On 6 June 2025, an extended single was released, featuring four remixed or alternate recordings of the song.<br>
<br>
On 11 July 2025, a rendition of the song featuring Lauren Daigle, was released.<br>
<br>
The song was inspired by the death of Jamie's dad.<br>
Lindsay Williams at the Christian radio network, K-Love, interviewed Jamie on 10 February 2025, and in that interview,<br>
Jamie said, "The lyrics for 'Desperate' were inspired by several ongoing life situations that were weighing heavy on our hearts but completely out of our control.<br>
Writing this with (Jonathan Gamble) and (Jordan Sapp) was truly a gift because both have become like brothers to me,<br>
and it was a safe space to share some really deep struggles that day, which led to the completion of this song."<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2025 song, Desperate, by Jamie MacDonald.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm at the end of myself and I'm<br>

This next song is inspired by Psalms 27, verses 7 and 8.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this Bible study series, Chapter Zero has also been known as the Parallel Bible page.<br>
Back when we were in The Bible's Greatest Hits, near the end of Chapter Zero, at Bonus 11,<br>
we were, at that time, enjoying all of Psalms 27.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a little snip from that Psalms 27.<br>
Psalms 27: 7 & 8 -- KJV<br>
7 Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.<br>
8 (My heart said unto thee, Let my face seek thy face.) When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27: 7 & 8 -- NLT<br>
7<br>
Hear me as I pray, O Lord.<br>
Be merciful and answer me!<br>
8<br>
My heart has heard you say, "Come and talk with me."<br>
And my heart responds, "Lord, I am coming."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Katy Nichole is an American singer and songwriter.<br>
Nichole made her debut in 2022, with the release of the single "In Jesus Name (God of Possible)."<br>
<br>
When we were in The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 31, also known as Christian Essays 31,<br>
we talked about Katy Nichole a bit, and we read the words to that song, "In Jesus Name (God of Possible)"<br>
because it is an amazing and powerful song, and it was the most-popular Christian song for the year of 2022.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"In Jesus Name (God of Possible)" was Katy Nichole's breakthrough hit,<br>
having reached number one on Billboard's Hot Christian Songs chart and Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart back in 2022.<br>
<br>
As of September of 2025, she has released two albums, and two Extended Plays (EPs).<br>
One of her songs that really spoke to me and my family was the song, "When I Fall" -- which is based on Psalms 27, verses 7 and 8.<br>
<br>
When I Fall is from her second album, Honest Conversations, which was released on 15 August 2025.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Official Music Video of When I Fall was uploaded onto YouTube on 6 February 2025.<br>
The Official Lyric Video was uploaded onto YouTube on 22 November 2024.<br>
And YouTube has a recording of a live performance of her singing this song back in June 2024 in Scottsdale, Arizona.<br>
<br>
<br>
Based on those dates, it seems that the song was created by the month of June of 2024, but did not seem to be officially released<br>
as a single until November of 2024.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
From the 2025 album, Honest Conversations,<br>
Here are the words to the 2024 song, When I Fall, from Katy Nichole.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lord I can't find you right now<br>
And everything is crashing down<br>
I'm losing faith and falling into my doubts<br>
<br>
How long will I have to fight<br>
Just for me to stay alive<br>
I know you're there God please just meet me here tonight<br>
<br>
My God I'm tired of trying to be OK<br>
I've prayed all the prayers I have to pray<br>
Please don't leave me lonely<br>
My God I need you to hold me<br>
<br>
My God I'm losing all the hope I got<br>
I'm far beyond the point of being lost<br>
I've tried but I can't let go<br>
'Cause God you catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I<br>
fall
<br>
There's hardly air in my lungs<br>
With all the damage that's been done<br>
Lord please sustain me now, I know you are enough<br>
<br>
My God I'm tired of trying to be OK<br>
I've prayed all the prayers I have to pray<br>
Please don't leave me lonely<br>
My God I need you to hold me<br>
<br>
My God I'm losing all the hope I got<br>
I'm far beyond the point of being lost<br>
I've tried but I can't let go<br>
Cause God you catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I<br>
fall<br>
<br>
<br>
Lord please help me now<br>
My soul is crying out<br>
<br>
<br>
My God I'm tired of trying to be OK<br>
I've prayed all the prayers I have to pray<br>
Please don't leave me lonely<br>
My God I need you to hold me<br>
My God I'm losing all the hope I got<br>
I'm far beyond the point of being lost<br>
I've tried but I can't let go<br>
Cause God you catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I<br>
fall<br>
