Did Goliath have any brothers? Yes, he did. Goliath and his brothers can be found here:<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 21:18-22 (NIV):<br>
"In the course of time, there was a war with the Philistines at Gob. At that time, Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of the giants. In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod. In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He also was descended from the giants. When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him. These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men."<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 20:4-8 (NIV):<br>
"In the course of the war against the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath, who was from Gath. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's rod. In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha. When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him. These were the descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
These passages indicate that Goliath had brothers who were also giants, specifically mentioning that Lahmi was a brother of Goliath. The term "descendants of Rapha" refers to the giants, which implies that Goliath and his brothers were part of this lineage.<br>
<br>
<br>
The identification of the individuals mentioned in the passages as brothers of Goliath is based on the context and wording used in the biblical texts. Here's how the connections are made:<br>
<br>
Contextual Clues:<br>
In both 2 Samuel 21:18-22 and 1 Chronicles 20:4-8, the narrative discusses battles involving the Philistines and mentions Goliath specifically. The passages refer to other giants who are described as being from Gath, the same city as Goliath, and they are noted as descendants of Rapha, which is a term often associated with giants.<br>
<br>
Direct Mention:<br>
In 1 Chronicles 20:4, it explicitly states that Elhanan killed "Lahmi the brother of Goliath." This direct mention establishes a familial relationship.<br>
<br>
Similar Descriptions:<br>
The other giants mentioned in these passages are described in ways that align with the characteristics of Goliath, such as their size and lineage. This suggests they are part of the same family or group of giants.<br>
<br>
Repetition of Themes:<br>
The mention of multiple giants in the context of battles against Israel, along with the specific reference to Goliath's brother, reinforces the idea that these individuals are related.<br>
<br>
Whilst the texts do not provide a detailed family tree, the combination of these contextual clues and direct references leads to the conclusion that the giants mentioned in these passages are indeed brothers or close relatives of Goliath.<br>
<br>
<br>
Based on these biblical accounts, here is a list of Goliath and his four brothers:<br>
<br>
1. Goliath - The most well-known giant, defeated by David.<br>
2. Lahmi - Specifically mentioned as the brother of Goliath in 1 Chronicles 20:4.<br>
3. Saph - Mentioned in 2 Samuel 21:18 as one of the giants killed by David's men.<br>
4. Ishbi-Benob - Also mentioned in 2 Samuel 21:16 as a giant who sought to kill David.<br>
5. Another unnamed giant - Described in 2 Samuel 21:20 as a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, who was also a descendant of the giants.<br>
<br>
These names and descriptions are derived from the passages in 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles, which discuss the battles with the Philistines and the giants associated with Goliath.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible, the verse that describes David selecting smooth stones before fighting Goliath is found in 1 Samuel 17:40. Here is the verse:<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 17:40 (KJV):<br>
("And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the valley, and put them in a shepherd's vessell which he had,)<br>
"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Perhaps David chose five smooth stones before facing Goliath, because Goliath had four brothers, which would be a total of five giants known to be in the region.<br>
<br>
The reason David chose five smooth stones before facing Goliath is not explicitly stated in the biblical text, so interpretations vary. Some scholars and commentators suggest that David may have selected five stones in anticipation of facing not only Goliath but also his brothers, as there are references to multiple giants associated with Goliath.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, David only needed one stone to defeat Goliath, which emphasises his faith in God rather than reliance on physical weapons.<br>
<br>
We only need one stone to defeat our enemy, and that stone is our chief cornerstone, the head stone of the corner, our firm foundation, the rock that travelled with them, standing in the shadow of a great rock in a weary land, the solid rock on which I stand. Who set me up upon a rock?<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:5 -- KJV<br>
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27: 4 & 5 -- NLT<br>
4<br>
The one thing I ask of the Lord --<br>
the thing I seek most --<br>
is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,<br>
delighting in the Lord's perfections<br>
and meditating in his Temple.<br>
5<br>
For he will conceal me there when troubles come;<br>
he will hide me in his sanctuary.<br>
He will place me out of reach on a high rock.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 32:2 -- KJV<br>
And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 62:1 -- KJV<br>
Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 31:3 -- KJV<br>
For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 95:1 -- KJV<br>
O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 18:2 -- KJV<br>
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.<br>

<br>
There was a 1967 song that became very popular in 1969.<br>
It was called, "Oh Happy Day."<br>
The original version was first released in 1755,<br>
coming from clergyman Philip Doddridge. That 1755 hymn was then put to music<br>
that was originally released in 1704 by Johann Anastasius Freylinghausen (1670 - 1739).<br>
<br>
The melody was then modified in 1854 by Edward Rimbault,<br>
and his version had the title, O Happy Day, That Fixed My Choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
The exact year Philip Doddridge wrote the hymn "Oh, Happy Day"<br>
is not definitively documented.<br>
However, it is believed that he composed the text<br>
in the early 18th century, likely around the 1730s.<br>
<br>
<br>
The hymn "Oh, Happy Day" is often attributed to Philip Doddridge,<br>
but it was actually published posthumously.<br>
Doddridge wrote the text of the hymn,<br>
but it was not released until after his death in 1751.<br>
The hymn was included in a collection of his works that was published in 1755.<br>
<br>
So, whilst Doddridge did not release the hymn himself,<br>
his work was compiled and published by others after his passing.<br>
<br>
<br>
To summarise this again,<br>
The original 1755 lyrics were published four years after the death of English Nonconformist, Congregationalist, minister, educator, and hymnwriter, Philip Doddridge (1702 - 1751).<br>
It may have been written sometime during the 1730s, but the exact year is unknown.<br>
The added 1854 lyrics were by British organist, musicologist, book collector and author Edward Rimbault (1816 - 1876),<br>
and the popular 1967 arrangement and lyrics were created by American gospel musician, pianist, vocalist, choir master, composer, and arranger Edwin Hawkins (1943 - 2018).<br>
<br>
<br>
Edwin Hawkins was one of the originators of the urban contemporary gospel sound.<br>
As the leader of the Edwin Hawkins Singers, he was probably best known for his 1967 arrangement of "Oh Happy Day."<br>
<br>
<br>
The song is based on the story found in the Book of Acts 8:26-40.<br>
<br>
Here is a short summary of this story found in Acts 8:26-40.<br>
<br>
The angel of the Lord instructs Philip to travel south to Gaza. There, he encounters an Ethiopian eunuch, a high official reading the book of Isaiah. Philip approaches him and asks if he understands what he is reading. The eunuch invites Philip to explain, leading to a discussion about Jesus. As they travel, they come across water, and the eunuch requests baptism.<br>
<br>
Philip baptises him, and suddenly, the Spirit of the Lord takes Philip away.<br>
<br>
The eunuch continues his journey rejoicing, whilst Philip suddenly finds himself in Azotus, preaching the gospel in various towns until he reaches Caesarea.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dorothy Combs Morrison is an American gospel music singer.<br>
She sang the lead vocal on the song "Oh Happy Day" recorded in 1967 by the Edwin Hawkins Singers.<br>
The 1967 recording was made at the Ephesian Church of God in Christ, in Berkeley, California.<br>
<br>
Berkeley, California, is on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay.<br>
Berkeley is about 13 miles east of San Francisco, and about 5 miles north of the city of Oakland, California.<br>
<br>
The 1967 recording was first released outside of the United States in 1968.<br>
After it was eventually released in the United States, in April of 1969, it became one of the most popular songs of 1969.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, the song was also known as, "O Happy Day That Fixed My Choice" when it was released in 1854.<br>
<br>
Here are now the words to the song, Oh Happy Day.<br>
This reading will include the<br>
1755 lyrics written by Philip Doddridge,<br>
the added 1854 lyrics by Edward Rimbault,<br>
and the 1967 lyrics added by Edwin Hawkins, and made famous by Dorothy Morrison and The Edwin Hawkins Singers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
O happy day, that fixed my choice<br>
On thee, my Saviour and my God!<br>
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,<br>
And tell its raptures all abroad.<br>
<br>
<br>
O happy bond,<br>
that seals my vows To Him<br>
Who merits all my love!<br>
Let cheerful anthems fill His house,<br>
While to that sacred shrine I move.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
'Tis done, the great transaction's done:<br>
I am my Lord's, and he is mine;<br>
He drew me, and I followed on,<br>
Charmed to confess the voice divine.<br>
<br>
<br>
'Tis done -- the great transaction's done;<br>
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;<br>
He drew me and I followed on,<br>
Rejoiced to own the call divine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now rest, my long-divided heart;<br>
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest,<br>
Nor ever from thy Lord depart;<br>
With him of every good possessed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now rest, my long-divided heart,<br>
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest;<br>
Here have I found a nobler part;<br>
Here heav'nly pleasures fill my breast.<br>
<br>
<br>
High heav'n, that heard the solemn vow,<br>
That vow renewed shall daily hear,<br>
Till in life's latest hour I bow,<br>
And bless in death a bond so dear.<br>
<br>
<br>

Song of Solomon - Song of Songs 2:1 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
I am the rose of the field, and the lily of the valleys.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In the Geneva Bible margin notes, it says that,<br>
The Church defines the rest of the book (of the Song of Solomon - Song of Songs)<br>
as being under the shadow of Christ.<br>
She heareth his voice.<br>
She is compared to the dove, and the enemies to the foxes.<br>

Isaiah's Prayer for Zion and Jerusalem...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 62:4 -- NLT<br>
Never again will you be called "The Forsaken City"<br>
or "The Desolate Land."<br>
<br>
(Never again will you be called "forsaken"<br>
or "desolate.")<br>
<br>
(Never again will you be called "Azubah"<br>
or "Shemamah.")<br>
<br>
<br>
Your new name will be "The City of God's Delight"<br>
and "The Bride of God,"<br>
<br>
(Your new name will be "My Delight Is In Her"<br>
and "Married,")<br>
<br>
(Your new name will be "Hephzibah"<br>
and "Beulah,")<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: The land will be called, Beulah, according to Isaiah 62:4.<br>
In the song that we will be looking at next,<br>
there is a mention about going sightseeing in Beulah, one of the new names for Zion and Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes, in the English language, the greeting,<br>
"How do you do?" from the 16th century,<br>
eventually became "Howdy-do" in the 19th century,<br>
which eventually was shortened to "Howdy"<br>
and became popular in the American West.<br>
"Howdy" is an informal way of saying "Hello."<br>
<br>
<br>
As of July of 2025, that song, Oh Happy Day<br>
by The Edwin Hawkins Singers<br>
was the number two best-selling gospel song of all time.<br>
<br>
What is the number one<br>
best-selling gospel song of all time?<br>
<br>
It is a 1947 recording by Mahalia Jackson.<br>
The song is titled, Move On Up a Little Higher.<br>
<br>
It was released as a single, in the form of a 10-inch phonographic record<br>
that spun at 78 revolutions per minute (78 RPM).<br>
<br>
The maximum recording time was typically around 3 to 4 minutes per side,<br>
which is why the recording has a brief, silent moment, as Side A ended,<br>
and then the song continued on Side B.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mahalia Jackson (1911 - 1972).<br>
She was an American gospel singer,<br>
widely considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century.<br>
With a career spanning 40 years, Jackson was integral to the development and spread<br>
of gospel blues in black churches throughout the United States.<br>
<br>
"Move On Up a Little Higher" is a gospel song written by W. Herbert Brewster,<br>
first recorded by Brother John Sellers in late 1946,<br>
and then most famously recorded on 12 September 1947,<br>
by gospel singer Mahalia Jackson,<br>
whose version sold eight million copies and<br>
as of July of 2025, it still is the number one best-selling gospel song of all time.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Easter<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Bunny is a child's word for a rabbit.<br>
A bunny is a rabbit.<br>
A rabbit is a small animal with long ears and soft fur, that lives in a hole in the ground.<br>
A rabbit is a small, burrowing, herbivorous mammal belonging to the same family as the hare.<br>
A hare is an animal like a rabbit, but larger, which can run very quickly.<br>
A hare is a herbivorous mammal like a rabbit but slightly larger and with longer legs and ears.<br>
A hare is an animal like a large rabbit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 11:6 -- KJV<br>
And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 11:6 -- NLT<br>
The hare chews the cud but does not have split hooves, so it is unclean.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 11:6 -- TS2009<br>
and the hare, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is unclean to you;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- KJV<br>
And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison,<br>
and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him;<br>
intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Greek word that was translated into the English word, Easter, is pronounced, Poss-Ha.<br>
It means, Passover.<br>
<br>
<br>
Today, the Greek word for Passover is pronounced,<br>
Ev-Rake-Oh-Pask-Ha<br>
<br>
<br>
This Greek word, Poss-Ha,<br>
is found in the New Testament 29 times.<br>
All of the other 28 of the 29 occurrences all choose the English word, Passover.<br>
<br>
Why does Acts 12:4 say, Easter, instead of Passover?<br>
The Greek word even sounds similar to the Hebrew word for Passover, which is Pay-Sock.<br>
Hebrew word: Pay-Sock<br>
Greek word: Poss-Ha<br>
<br>
Why did the KJV translation team choose the word Easter in Acts 12:4?<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- NLT<br>
Then he imprisoned him, placing him under the guard<br>
of four squads of four soldiers each.<br>
Herod intended to bring Peter out for public trial after the Passover.<br>
<br>
-- NLT says that it is Passover and not Easter. --<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- TS-2009<br>
So when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to watch over him, intending to bring him before the people after Pay-Sock (the Hebrew word for Passover).<br>
<br>
-- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) says that it is Passover and not Easter. --<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
And when he had caught him, he put him in prison,<br>
and delivered him to foure quaternions of soldiers to be kept,<br>
intending after the Passover to bring him foorth to the people.<br>
<br>
-- Geneva Bible also says that it is Passover and not Easter. --<br>
<br>
(Geneva Bible 1560 margin note: As for the foure quaternions of soldiers,<br>
the number being sixteen was divided by fours, to keep divers wards.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- NIV<br>
After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.<br>
<br>
-- NIV also says that it is Passover and not Easter. --<br>
<br>
Acts 12:4 -- New American Standard Bible (NASB 1995)<br>
When he had seized him, he put him in prison,<br>
delivering him to four squads of soldiers to guard him,<br>
intending after the Passover to bring him out before the people.<br>
<br>
-- NASB 1995 also says that it is Passover and not Easter. --<br>
<br>
Five other English translation teams are all saying that the KJV has performed a complete failure in the accuracy of their translation of Acts 12:4.<br>
<br>
Again, I ask, why did the KJV translation team choose the word Easter in Acts 12:4?<br>
Is it a stupid mistake, or an intentional lie inserted into the KJV by satanic people?<br>
<br>
This is why it is always a good idea to study the Bible in more than one English translation.<br>
Don't stay stuck in only one single English translation. In a multitude of counsellors there is safety.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is an interesting commentary about this argument and discussion.<br>
This article is published by Chick Publications.<br>
Chick Publications is best known for Chick cartoon tracts.<br>
<br>
A tract is a short pamphlet or booklet that conveys a religious message, often used for evangelism.<br>
Chick cartoon tracts are illustrated pamphlets created by Jack Chick, featuring comic-style narratives<br>
that promote Christian beliefs and often address moral issues.<br>
Founded in 1974, Chick Publications gained prominence for its distinctive, often controversial tracts that blend humour and serious themes.<br>
The tracts cover various topics, including salvation, sin, and societal issues,<br>
and have been translated into multiple languages. Despite criticism for their confrontational style,<br>
Chick tracts have reached millions, making them a significant part of evangelical outreach.<br>
<br>
Samuel C. Gipp is an American author and evangelist known for his work in Christian literature, particularly in having reasoned arguments or writings in defence of the Bible.<br>
He gained prominence with his 1989 book, "The Answer Book -- A Helpbook for Christians,"<br>
which addresses common questions and challenges faced by Christians.<br>
Gipp is also recognised for his advocacy of the King James Version of the Bible,<br>
and has written extensively on its significance.<br>
His writings often focus on defending the faith and providing resources for believers to strengthen their understanding of Christianity.<br>
<br>
Again, Samuel C. Gipp is the author of the 1989 book, "The Answer Book -- A Helpbook for Christians."<br>
The following selected content comes from that book.<br>
Here are some selected quotations taken from the Samuel C. Gipp's book, and placed into this 1989 article, titled,<br>
Isn't "Easter" a Mistranslation of "Pascha" (Poss-Ha) and Should It Be Translated As "Passover"?<br>
As of July of 2025, this quoted material was found on this Chick Publications webpage...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.chick.com/Information/article?id=Isnt-Easter-A-Mistranslation-of-Pascha">https://www.chick.com/Information/article?id=Isnt-Easter-A-Mistranslation-of-Pascha</a><br>
<br>
Here are now some selected paragraphs being quoted from this 1989 commentary found on that Chick Publications webpage...<br>
<br>
The many opponents to the concept of having a perfect Bible have made much of this translation of "pascha" (Poss-Ha).<br>
<br>
Coming to the word "Easter" in (the KJV,) God's Authorised Bible, they seize upon it imagining that they have found proof that the Bible is not perfect. Fortunately for lovers of the word of God, they are wrong.<br>
<br>
Easter, as we know it, comes from the ancient pagan festival of Astarte. Also known as Ishtar (pronounced "Easter"). This festival has always been held late in the month of April. It was, in its original form, a celebration of the earth "regenerating" itself after the winter season.<br>
<br>
The festival involved a celebration of reproduction. For this reason the common symbols of Easter festivities were the rabbit (the same symbol as "Playboy" magazine), and the egg. Both are known for their reproductive abilities.<br>
<br>
At the centre of attention was Astarte, the female deity. She is known in the Bible as the "queen of heaven" (Jeremiah 7:18; Jeremiah 44:17-25). She is the mother of Tammuz (Ezekiel 8:14) who was also her husband! These perverted rituals would take place at sunrise on Easter morning (Ezekiel 8:13-16). From the references in Jeremiah and Ezekiel, we can see that the true Easter has never had any association with Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Problem: Even though the Jewish passover was held in mid April (the fourteenth) and the pagan festival Easter was held later the same month, how do we know that Herod was referring to Easter in Acts 12:4 and not the Jewish passover? If he was referring to the passover, the translation of "pascha" as "Easter" is incorrect. If he was indeed referring to the pagan holyday (holiday) Easter, then the King James Bible (1611) must truly be the very word and words of God for it is the only Bible in print today which has the correct reading.<br>
<br>
To unravel the confusion concerning "Easter" in verse 4, we must consult our FINAL authority, THE BIBLE.<br>
<br>
It must also be noted that whenever the passover is mentioned in the New Testament, the reference is always to the meal, to be eaten on the night of April 14th not the entire week. The days of unleavened bread are NEVER referred to as the Passover. (It must be remembered that the angel of the Lord passed over Egypt on one night, not seven nights in a row.)<br>
<br>
Now let us look at (the KJV of) Acts 12:3,4: "And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people."<br>
<br>
Verse 3 shows that Peter was arrested during the days of unleavened bread (April 15-21). The Bible says: "Then were the days of unleavened bread." The passover (April 14th) had already come and gone. Herod could not possibly have been referring to the passover in his statement concerning Easter. The next Passover was a year away! But the pagan holiday of Easter was just a few days away. Remember! Herod was a pagan Roman who worshipped the "queen of heaven". He was NOT a Jew. He had no reason to keep the Jewish passover. Some might argue that he wanted to wait until after the passover for fear of upsetting the Jews. There are two grievous faults in this line of thinking.<br>
<br>
First, Peter was no longer considered a Jew. He had repudiated Judaism. The Jews would have no reason to be upset by Herod's actions.<br>
<br>
Second, he could not have been waiting until after the passover because he thought the Jews would not kill a man during a religious holiday. They had killed Jesus during passover (Matthew 26:17-19,47). They were also excited about Herod's murder of James. Anyone knows that a mob possesses the courage to do violent acts during religious festivities, not after.<br>
<br>
In further considering Herod's position as a Roman, we must remember that the Herods were well known for celebrating (Matthew 14:6-11). In fact, in Matthew chapter 14 we see that a Herod was even willing to kill a man of God during one of his celebrations.<br>
<br>
It is elementary to see that Herod, in Acts 12, had arrested Peter during the days of unleavened bread, after the passover. The days of unleavened bread would end on the 21st of April. Shortly after that would come Herod's celebration of pagan Easter. Herod had not killed Peter during the days of unleavened bread simply because he wanted to wait until Easter. Since it is plain that both the Jews (Matthew 26:17- 47) and the Romans (Matthew 14:6-11) would kill during a religious celebration, Herod's opinion seemed that he was not going to let the Jews "have all the fun ". He would wait until his own pagan festival and see to it that Peter died in the excitement.<br>
<br>
Thus we see that it was God's providence which had the Spirit-filled translators of our Bible (King James Version) to CORRECTLY translate "pascha" as "Easter". It most certainly did not refer to the Jewish passover. In fact, to change it to "passover" would confuse the reader and make the truth of the situation unclear.<br>
<br>
<br>
And that is the end of the commentary quoted from the 1989 article,<br>
Isn't "Easter" a Mistranslation of "Pascha" and Should It Be Translated As "Passover"?<br>
which comes from Samuel C. Gipp's 1989 book, "The Answer Book -- A Helpbook for Christians."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
We are only commanded to do the seven feasts, and Easter is not the same as Passover.<br>
Just try your best to study, guard, appreciate, celebrate, observe and do the Sabbath days of rest, and the seven feasts that are in the Bible, and have nothing to do with all of the other so-called special days that are observed in your country.<br>
The world will try to make you miscalculate the days, and then the world will try to get you to fail and forget all about the seven feasts.<br>

Random trivia:<br>
The earliest known reference to a Seder-like meal appears in the Mishnah, a compilation of Jewish oral laws completed around the year of 200 AD.<br>
Question. Why does The Chosen TV Series show Christ doing a Seder-like meal at Passover when the Seder-like meal did not exist until the year 200 AD?<br>
Answer. If it is not in the Bible, then it is not true. The Seder-like meal is not in the Bible. Do you know who those people are that are producing and making The Chosen TV Series? Do you know what they really believe in? There are clues hiding in the end credits. Be careful! Don't be deceived! Are those just movie props that they are providing, or are they charged objects?<br>

Commentary:<br>
One morning, in July of 2025, my wife was reading her KJV Bible,<br>
and she came across this little area in 2 Corinthians 1.<br>
If you take the word, Asia, and replace it with the city that we were living in at that time,<br>
it sounded like it was describing us, and our situation, and how we felt, being stuck there, in that place.<br>
<br>
If you take the city that you are living in right now,<br>
and you place your city name right in there, where it mentions Asia, is it also talking about you,<br>
and your situation, and how you feel, being stuck where you are right now?<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8 & 9 -- KJV<br>
1:8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:<br>
(But we had the answer of death in ourselves,)<br>
1:9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8 & 9 -- NLT<br>
(We think you ought to know, dear brothers,)<br>
8 We think you ought to know, dear brothers and sisters, about the trouble we went through in the province of Asia. We were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure, and we thought we would never live through it.<br>
9 In fact, we expected to die. But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God, who raises the dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8 & 9 -- TS2009<br>
8 For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brothers, of our pressure which came to us in Asia, that we were weighed down, exceedingly, beyond ability, so that we despaired even of life.<br>
9 Indeed, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in ELL-Low-Heem who raises the dead,<br>

Watch what happens when we read that again, but keep reading just two more verses after that.<br>

2 Corinthians 1: 8-11 -- KJV<br>
1:8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:<br>
(But we had the answer of death in ourselves,)<br>
1:9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:<br>
1:10 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;<br>
1:11 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8-11 -- NLT<br>
(We think you ought to know, dear brothers,)<br>
8 We think you ought to know, dear brothers and sisters, about the trouble we went through in the province of Asia. We were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure, and we thought we would never live through it.<br>
9 In fact, we expected to die. But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God, who raises the dead.<br>
10 And he did rescue us from mortal danger, and he will rescue us again. We have placed our confidence in him, and he will continue to rescue us.<br>
11 And you are helping us by praying for us. Then many people will give thanks because God has graciously answered so many prayers for our safety.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8-11 -- TS2009<br>
8 For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brothers, of our pressure which came to us in Asia, that we were weighed down, exceedingly, beyond ability, so that we despaired even of life.<br>
9 Indeed, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in ELL-Low-Heem who raises the dead,<br>
10 who rescued us from so great a death, and does rescue, in whom we trust that He shall still rescue us,<br>
11 you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks shall be given by many on our behalf for the favour bestowed upon us through many.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The summary and conclusion is, we need to keep praying for each other.<br>
When we pray for each other, we really are helping each other, and He is faithful to rescue us again and again.<br>

34:18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.<br>
34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.<br>

<br>
Psalms 34: 17-19 -- NLT<br>
17<br>
The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.<br>
He rescues them from all their troubles.<br>
18<br>
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted;<br>
he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.<br>
19<br>
The righteous person faces many troubles,<br>
but the Lord comes to the rescue each time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34 is a psalm of David, regarding the time he pretended to be insane in front of Abimelech, who sent him away.<br>
Psalms 34 is a Hebrew acrostic poem; each verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
In the TS2009 translation, at the beginning of each verse, there is an attempt to pronounce each letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
English words are being spelled here in such a way as to help pronounce those Hebrew letters and names more accurately.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34: 17-19 -- TS2009<br>
17 Saudi<br>
The righteous cried out, and Yaw-Who-Wah heard, And delivered them out of all their distresses.<br>
18 Koof<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah is near to the broken-hearted, And saves those whose spirit is crushed.<br>
19 Raysh<br>
Many are the evils of the righteous, But Yaw-Who-Wah delivers him out of them all.<br>

We have many Bible studies that quote a verse here and there out of Psalms Chapter 34.<br>
<br>
During a random moment about half-way into Christian Essays 5,<br>
which is also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 5,<br>
we did a Bible study by reading all of Psalms 34 in the KJV and NLT.<br>
<br>
At a random moment towards the end of Christian Essays 26,<br>

In early August of 2025, my daughter was reading through the book of Isaiah in the KJV, and when she found these two Bible verses, she took a full sheet of paper, and coloured the entire paper a bright, sunny yellow colour, and then hand-wrote these two Bible verses with big letters, and then placed them on the fridge in the kitchen. Every morning, when I'm trying to start my day, when I see these two Bible verses, I read them again and again, and it cheers me up, and reminds me of His promises, and how much He loves us.<br>

Isaiah 33:6 -- KJV<br>
And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,<br>
(and strength of salvations:)<br>

the fear of the LORD is his treasure.<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Commentary: Just think about all of the things that are being mentioned in just these two Bible verses. He loads us up daily with His blessings and His benefits. He gives us wisdom and knowledge, He gives us stability and a firm foundation, He gives us strength, He gives us salvation, He gives us His son so that He can give us eternal life, everlasting life. He gives us His kingdom as an inheritance, because we are His children, and He is our perfect Father. He gives us the Fear of Yaw-Who-Wah, He gives us His set of instructions, His Torah. He is our king, and He promises to save us. In a world of chaos, confusion, insecurities and instabilities, He promises to be the stability of these times that we are in right now.<br>

<br>
Isaiah 53:3 -- KJV<br>
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief:<br>
<br>
and we hid as it were our faces from him;<br>
(and he hid as it were his face from us;)<br>
(and we hid as a hiding of faces from him;)<br>
(and he hid as a hiding of faces from us;)<br>
<br>
he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<br>
<br>
Let's look at that English word, esteemed.<br>
That English word is a translation from an ancient Hebrew word.<br>
The Hebrew word that was originally right there is pronounced, Haw-Shev.<br>
<br>
It is a Hebrew word that is found one hundred and twenty-four times in the Bible.<br>
This Hebrew word, Haw-Shev. What does it mean?<br>
<br>
<br>
We will once again quickly consult our usual references...<br>
<br>
Strong's Greek and Hebrew Dictionary and Tense, Voice, and Mood Definitions (also known as TVM Definitions)<br>
first published in 1890, by James Strong.<br>
<br>
A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,<br>
compiled by Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver, and Charles Augustus Briggs,<br>
first published in 1906, commonly known today as the Brown-Driver-Briggs definitions.<br>
<br>
Tyndale Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Hebrew (TBESH) published by Tyndale House, in Cambridge, England.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This Hebrew word, Haw-Shev.<br>
It can mean,<br>
esteem<br>
to think, plan, account<br>
to think to do, devise, plan<br>
value, regard<br>
to be imputed<br>
to be computed, be reckoned<br>
invent, make a judgement, imagine, count<br>
to think upon, consider, to be considered<br>
be mindful of.<br>
<br>
The English word, Esteem. What does that mean?<br>
We will look at the word definitions in the<br>
Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford dictionaries,<br>
as they were found to be back in August of 2025.<br>
<br>
The English word, Esteem. It means...<br>
a feeling of respect for someone, or a good opinion of someone,<br>
to value, respect or think highly of someone or something.<br>
high regard or respect, respected.<br>
respect for or a good opinion of someone<br>
to respect someone or something or have a good opinion of them<br>
to consider or believe someone or something to be a particular thing<br>
Esteem is the admiration and respect that you feel towards another person.<br>
If you esteem someone or something, you respect or admire them.<br>
great respect and approval; a good opinion of somebody.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
After looking over this information, if we esteemed him not<br>
it could mean that<br>
We did not esteem him,<br>
we did not think about who he really was.<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Isaiah, Chapter 53, is a prophecy about Jesus.<br>
This prophecy was written sometime around in the years from<br>
740 BC down to 700 BC (the BC years count down, backwards, because those numbers are below the year of zero.)<br>
Again, Isaiah, Chapter 53, was written sometime around 740 BC down to 700 BC,<br>
which is more than 700 years before Jesus was born.<br>
This was a big prophecy that all came true, written more than 700 years before it was supposed to happen.<br>
<br>
If I want to esteem Him right now, and I think about all of what these word definitions could mean,<br>
I need to<br>
think about him, and who He is, and what He did for me.<br>
I need to think about what His plans are for me.<br>
I need to value Him, consider Him, and what He wants me to do for Him.<br>
I need to me mindful of Him.<br>
I need to value Him and respect Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Think about that again. I need to value Him and respect Him.<br>
That reminds me of the Lord's Prayer.<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:9 (KJV)<br>
After this manner therefore pray ye:<br>
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<br>
<br>
Hallowed be thy name.<br>
What does that word, Hallowed, mean?<br>
<br>
Let's think about the Greek word right there that was translated into the English word, Hallowed.<br>
That Greek word there is pronounced, Haw-Key-Odd-Zoh.<br>
The K has more of a Guh sound, like the Guh sound in Goose.<br>
<br>
Haw-Key-Odd-Zoh. What does it mean?<br>
<br>
Since the New Testament is commonly referenced as being from the Greek,<br>
we will grab a few more reference books to look at here...<br>
<br>
We'll use again the Strong's Greek and Hebrew Dictionary and TVM Definitions,<br>
and we will consider what is in the<br>
Greek-English lexicon by John Jeffrey Dodson (2010)<br>
<br>
Strong's Greek Dictionary provided by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen from Michael Grier, published in 2012.<br>
<br>
Thayer's Lexicon, prepared by Alan Bunning, from the Centre for New Testament Restoration, published in 2013,<br>
based on the Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, which was first published in 1889 by Joseph Henry Thayer.<br>
<br>
and the Tyndale Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Greek (also known as the TBESG), first published in 2015.<br>
<br>
The Greek word, Haw-Key-Odd-Zoh. What does it mean?<br>
Let's put the definitions into the context of the prayer.<br>
<br>
Our Father in heaven,<br>
may your name be hallowed.<br>
<br>
Our Father in heaven,<br>
may your name be kept holy.<br>
may your name be holy<br>
Let us make your name holy.<br>
Let us sanctify your name.<br>
<br>
Your name I make holy, I treat as holy, I set apart as holy,<br>
I sanctify, hallow, purify your name.<br>
<br>
to hallow means to make holy, consecrate, sanctify<br>
to dedicate, separate, set apart for God<br>
to purify, make conformable in character to such dedication<br>
to treat as holy<br>
to separate from profane things and dedicate to God<br>
may we consecrate your name,<br>
dedicate your name, purify, cleanse your name.<br>
<br>
<br>
The English word, Hallowed. What does it mean?<br>
We will look at the word definitions in the<br>
Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford dictionaries,<br>
as they were found to be back in August of 2025.<br>
<br>
The English word, Hallowed.<br>
If we insert the dictionary definitions into the context of the Lord's Prayer,<br>
we get this...<br>
may your name be holy or made holy<br>
may your name be important and respected.<br>
May we make or regard your name as holy<br>
May we consecrate or set apart your name as being sacred.<br>
May your name be very respected and praised because of your great importance.<br>
May your name be respected and admired.<br>
<br>

Isaiah 53:3 -- NLT<br>
He was despised and rejected --<br>
a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief.<br>
We turned our backs on him and looked the other way.<br>
He was despised, and we did not care.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 53:3 -- TS2009<br>
despised and rejected by men, a man of pains and knowing sickness.<br>
And as one from whom the face is hidden, being despised,<br>
and we did not consider Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:9 -- NLT<br>
Pray like this:<br>
Our Father in heaven,<br>
may your name be kept holy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Hebrew word for holy is, Kah-Doe-Sh or Koh-Desh.<br>
The Hebrew word for "the" is pronounced Ha.<br>
The Holy, in Hebrew, would be Ha-Koh-Desh.<br>
Spirit of The Holy, is, Roo-Awk Ha-Koh-Desh.<br>
Spirit of The Holy is the Holy Spirit.<br>
Roo-Awk Ha-Koh-Desh is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of The Holy.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for holy, Kah-Doe-Sh or Koh-Desh,<br>
it means to be set apart, as if, to be set apart for a special purpose.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:9 -- TS2009<br>
"This, then, is the way you should pray: <br>
'Our Father who is in the heavens, let Your Name be set-apart,<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's now bring this Bible study to a conclusion with a quick prayer.<br>
<br>
Heavenly Father, our ELL-Low-Heem, The Lord of Hosts, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat,<br>
Beloved Son, our Master, our Ah-Doe-Nye, Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck,<br>
What do you want me to do for you today?<br>
How can I do a better job of loving you with all of my heart, mind, soul and strength?<br>
How can I do a better job of loving my neighbour and my family?<br>
Help us esteem you, and remember you, and consider your ways and your plans.<br>
Help us always put you and your name in a place of honour.<br>
Stop the sin, stop the lies, stop the sorrows, stop the bitterness.<br>
Let us have no more drinking of the wine of sorrows,<br>
and no more drinking of the wine of bitterness.<br>
Help me stop sinning, right now, and forever more. Help me stop thinking wrong thoughts.<br>
Heal me and my family. Heal me and save me from my past, from my mistakes, and from my failures.<br>
Heal us. Help us. Provide for us. Save us. Be our salvation. Be our Yeh-Shoe-Uh. In the name of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck,<br>
In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>

she was again very blessed by the many treasures that she found all throughout that book of Isaiah.<br>

Back in late August and early September of 2025,<br>
there were two popular Christian songs that really spoke to us about how we were feeling and<br>
the difficulties and struggles of the life that we were living at that time.<br>
<br>
The first song was from Jamie MacDonald.<br>
<br>
Jamie MacDonald is an American contemporary Christian pop singer-songwriter from Nashville, Tennessee.<br>
As of September of 2025, she had not yet released any albums.<br>
Her third single, titled, Desperate, was first released on 3 January 2025,<br>
and eventually peaked at number 10 on the Hot Christian Songs chart by Billboard magazine, on 12 April 2025.<br>
During that same week, it was the number one most popular song on the Christian Adult Contemporary chart, also published by Billboard magazine.<br>
<br>
On 6 June 2025, an extended single was released, featuring four remixed or alternate recordings of the song.<br>
<br>
On 11 July 2025, a rendition of the song featuring Lauren Daigle, was released.<br>
<br>
The song was inspired by the death of Jamie's dad.<br>
Lindsay Williams at the Christian radio network, K-Love, interviewed Jamie on 10 February 2025, and in that interview,<br>
Jamie said, "The lyrics for 'Desperate' were inspired by several ongoing life situations that were weighing heavy on our hearts but completely out of our control.<br>
Writing this with (Jonathan Gamble) and (Jordan Sapp) was truly a gift because both have become like brothers to me,<br>
and it was a safe space to share some really deep struggles that day, which led to the completion of this song."<br>
<br>
<br>
Jamie MacDonald's song, Desperate, was very popular in 2025.<br>
<br>
What was once known for many years as Billboard Magazine,<br>
Today, it is more commonly known as, Billboard Media.<br>
Billboard Media has several different ways of trying to measure the popularity of Christian songs in these recent years.<br>
Those various Christian Music charts published by Billboard Media, would include the following examples...<br>
There is the Hot Christian Songs chart,<br>
the Christian Streaming Songs chart,<br>
the Christian Airplay Songs chart,<br>
and the more modern, Christian Digital Song Sales chart,<br>
and the Hot Christian Adult Contemporary (AC) Airplay chart.<br>
There are many more Christian music charts that they publish.<br>
I think the Hot Christian Songs chart is the best, as it combines various data points to compute the total popularity across all of the various media channels and platforms.<br>
The Hot Christian Songs chart measures popularity by using,<br>
Radio Airplay, Digital Sales (digital downloads), Streaming Activity from various streaming platforms (like Spotify and Apple Music),<br>
Audience Impressions (the estimated number of listeners and the reach of the song across radio and streaming platforms)<br>
and Social Media Engagement (engagement levels that can drive listeners to streaming or purchasing platforms).<br>
<br>
<br>
According to<br>
Billboard Media's<br>
Year-end Chart for<br>
Hot Christian Songs,<br>
the number 16 most popular song in 2025 was<br>
Desperate, by<br>
Jamie MacDonald.<br>
<br>
<br>
According to<br>
20 The Countdown Magazine, on their<br>
Top 20 Songs in Christian music for the year of 2025,<br>
Jamie Macdonald's song,<br>
Desperate,<br>
was the Number Four most popular Christian Song for the entire year of 2025.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2025 song, Desperate, by Jamie MacDonald.<br>
<br>
<br>

Isaiah 41:13 -- KJV<br>
For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next song really makes me think about something found in Psalms 37.<br>
We did study all of Psalms 37, all 40 verses of it, when we did the Bible study, titled,<br>
The Rescue from The Wicked and Evil,<br>
when we were near the end of Christian Essays 5,<br>
which is The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 5.<br>
<br>
Here is a little snip from Psalms 37...<br>
<br>
Psalms 37: 23 & 24 -- KJV<br>
(The steps of a good man are established by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.)<br>
23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.<br>
24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37: 23 & 24 -- NLT<br>
23<br>
The Lord directs the steps of the godly.<br>
He delights in every detail of their lives.<br>
24<br>
Though they stumble, they will never fall,<br>
for the Lord holds them by the hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next song is inspired by Psalms 27, verses 7 and 8.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this Bible study series, Chapter Zero has also been known as the Parallel Bible page.<br>
Back when we were in The Bible's Greatest Hits, near the end of Chapter Zero, at Bonus 11,<br>
we were, at that time, enjoying all of Psalms 27.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a little snip from that Psalms 27.<br>
Psalms 27: 7 & 8 -- KJV<br>
7 Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.<br>
8 (My heart said unto thee, Let my face seek thy face.) When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27: 7 & 8 -- NLT<br>
7<br>
Hear me as I pray, O Lord.<br>
Be merciful and answer me!<br>
8<br>
My heart has heard you say, "Come and talk with me."<br>
And my heart responds, "Lord, I am coming."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Katy Nichole is an American singer and songwriter.<br>
Nichole made her debut in 2022, with the release of the single "In Jesus Name (God of Possible)."<br>
<br>
When we were in The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 31, also known as Christian Essays 31,<br>
we talked about Katy Nichole a bit, and we read the words to that song, "In Jesus Name (God of Possible)"<br>
because it is an amazing and powerful song, and it was the most-popular Christian song for the year of 2022.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"In Jesus Name (God of Possible)" was Katy Nichole's breakthrough hit,<br>
having reached number one on Billboard's Hot Christian Songs chart and Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart back in 2022.<br>
<br>
As of September of 2025, she has released two albums, and two Extended Plays (EPs).<br>
One of her songs that really spoke to me and my family was the song, "When I Fall" -- which is based on Psalms 27, verses 7 and 8.<br>
<br>
When I Fall is from her second album, Honest Conversations, which was released on 15 August 2025.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Official Music Video of When I Fall was uploaded onto YouTube on 6 February 2025.<br>
The Official Lyric Video was uploaded onto YouTube on 22 November 2024.<br>
And YouTube has a recording of a live performance of her singing this song back in June 2024 in Scottsdale, Arizona.<br>
<br>
<br>
Based on those dates, it seems that the song was created by the month of June of 2024, but did not seem to be officially released<br>
as a single until November of 2024.<br>
<br>
<br>
According to<br>
Billboard Media's<br>
Year-end Chart for<br>
Hot Christian Songs,<br>
This song,<br>
When I Fall,<br>
from Katy Nichole,<br>
was the Number 38 most popular song of 2025.<br>
On the Christian Airplay Songs chart, it was the Number 28 most popular song of 2025,<br>
and on Billboard Media's Hot Christian Adult Contemporary (AC) Airplay chart,<br>
it was the Number 23 most popular song of 2025 on that chart.<br>
<br>
<br>
From the 2025 album, Honest Conversations,<br>
Here are the words to the 2024 song, When I Fall, from Katy Nichole.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lord I can't find you right now<br>
And everything is crashing down<br>
I'm losing faith and falling into my doubts<br>
<br>
How long will I have to fight<br>
Just for me to stay alive<br>
I know you're there God please just meet me here tonight<br>
<br>
My God I'm tired of trying to be OK<br>
I've prayed all the prayers I have to pray<br>
Please don't leave me lonely<br>
My God I need you to hold me<br>
<br>
My God I'm losing all the hope I got<br>
I'm far beyond the point of being lost<br>
I've tried but I can't let go<br>
'Cause God you catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I<br>
fall<br>
<br>
<br>
There's hardly air in my lungs<br>
With all the damage that's been done<br>
Lord please sustain me now, I know you are enough<br>
<br>
My God I'm tired of trying to be OK<br>
I've prayed all the prayers I have to pray<br>
Please don't leave me lonely<br>
My God I need you to hold me<br>
<br>
My God I'm losing all the hope I got<br>
I'm far beyond the point of being lost<br>
I've tried but I can't let go<br>
Cause God you catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I<br>
fall<br>
<br>
<br>
Lord please help me now<br>
My soul is crying out<br>
<br>
<br>
My God I'm tired of trying to be OK<br>
I've prayed all the prayers I have to pray<br>
Please don't leave me lonely<br>
My God I need you to hold me<br>
My God I'm losing all the hope I got<br>
I'm far beyond the point of being lost<br>
I've tried but I can't let go<br>
Cause God you catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I fall<br>
You catch me when I<br>
fall<br>

Remembering again some things mainly from Chapter Zero and Chapter One...<br>
(The Parallel Bible and Christian Essays 1)<br>
<br>
<br>
John 3:16<br>
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 10:9<br>
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember again a little something from the Bible study, titled,<br>
Remind Me Outside, Inside, Outside, Often<br>
which we looked at in Christian Essays 35...<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36: 25-27 Commentary:<br>
Verse 25: Trying to stay clean on the outside, (Tzit-Tzit) but the dirty mind and broken heart needs replacement and a change of mind.<br>
Verse 26: He (communion) goes inside, and does a heart replacement.<br>
Verse 27: His spirit now lives and dwells inside of you (communion) on the inside and that causes you to obey him successfully on the outside (Tzit-Tzit).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is something again that we looked at when we were almost half-way into Christian Essays 12...<br>
<br>
<br>
(Ezekiel) 36:27 (TS2009)<br>
and I shall give you a heart of flesh, and put My Spirit within you. And I shall cause you to walk in My laws and guard My right-rulings and shall do them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36: 25-27 -- KJV<br>
25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.<br>
26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.<br>
27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgements, and do them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Verse 27 is the proof that you are saved. If he is in you, his spirit will cause you to obey his commandments successfully and faithfully.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36: 25-29 -- NLT<br>
25 "Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship idols.<br>
<br>
26 And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart.<br>
(I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a heart of flesh.)<br>
<br>
<br>
27 And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.<br>
28 "And you will live in Israel, the land I gave your ancestors long ago. You will be my people, and I will be your God.<br>
29 I will cleanse you of your filthy behaviour.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If we take what we just read here, and also remember the Gospel, we have a list...<br>
1. Receive, accept and believe that Jesus is Lord -- Romans 10:9<br>
2. Pray and ask the Lord Jesus to enter into your heart and mind and soul<br>
3. Verse 25 -- He cleans you<br>
4. He remodels you, constructs you, and re-constructs you, doing demolition, remodelling, and new creating and constructing of you from within.<br>
5. Verse 26 -- He gives you a new heart and a new spirit<br>
6. Verse 27 -- He puts His Holy Spirit within you<br>
7. With His Holy Spirit, you can now follow, obey, guard, keep and actually do the Bible, the Torah, the Commandments.<br>
<br>
Again, step 7 is when he gives you the ability to obey and keep his commandments.<br>
You can't do step 7, until he does step 7.<br>
You can't do step 7, until you let him first do steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.<br>
Having trouble doing step 7? Go back and start with step 1, and pray in step 1.<br>
He's the one that does all of these steps, not you.<br>
He does all of this first, then you can observe, guard, keep and obey the Bible, the Torah, the Commandments.<br>
We have the Commandments of the Lord given to us through Moses in the Old Testament,<br>
and we have the Commandments of the Lord given to us through Jesus Christ in the New Testament.<br>
You can do all things through Christ, but without Christ, you can do nothing.<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:13 -- KJV<br>
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br>
<br>
John 15:5 (KJV)<br>
...without me ye can do nothing.<br>
<br>
He is the builder; you are the building.<br>
He is pottery maker, and you are the lump of clay.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 3:20 -- KJV<br>
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When the repairman knocks on the door, let him in so he can get to work and get things fixed.<br>
He's not going to knock if you don't call him, and tell him what needs fixing.<br>
It's not a phone you use to call him, what you use, it's called, prayer.<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:17<br>
Pray without ceasing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:9-13 (KJV) commonly known as The Lord's Prayer:<br>
After this manner therefore pray ye:<br>
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<br>
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us this day our daily bread.<br>
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<br>
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 6: Verses 23 through 26 -- KJV<br>
...On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,<br>
24 The Lord bless thee, and keep thee:<br>
25 The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:<br>
26 The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.<br>
<br>
Numbers 6: Verses 23 through 26 -- NLT:<br>
...bless the people of Israel with this special blessing:<br>
'May the Lord bless you<br>
and protect you.<br>
May the Lord smile on you<br>
and be gracious to you.<br>
May the Lord show you his favour<br>
and give you his peace.'<br>
<br>
Numbers 6 -- Verses 22 through 27 -- TS2009<br>
The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) translation...<br>
22 And the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah spoke to Mosheh (Moses), saying,<br>
23 "Speak to Aharon and his sons, saying, 'This is how you bless the children of (Israel) (in Hebrew, pronounced, Yis-Rye-ELL, or Yaw-Shaw-ReLL). Say to them:<br>
24 May the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah bless you and guard you; "<br>
25 May Yaw-Who-Wah make His face shine upon you, and show favour to you;<br>
26 and may Yaw-Who-Wah lift up His face upon you, and give you peace." '<br>
27 Thus they (Aharon and his sons) shall put My Name on the children of (Israel) (Yis-Rye-ELL, or Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), and I Myself (the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah) shall bless them.<br>

Unofficially nicknamed, The Priestly Blessing.<br>
Mosheh (Moe-Shay) is the correct Hebrew way to pronounce the English name, Moses.<br>
(the Lord spoke with Moses,)<br>
And the Lord spake with Mosheh, saying: Speak with Aharon and his sons, saying:<br>
Thus shall you bless the children of Israel, whilst spreading forth the hands from the high place (of speaking);<br>
in this tongue.<br>
The Lord bless thee and keep thee.<br>
The Lord make His face to shine upon thee, and gracious unto thee.<br>
The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and grant thee peace.<br>
The Lord bless thee in all thy business, and keep thee from demons of the night,<br>
and things that cause terror, and from demons of the noon and of the morning,<br>
and from malignant spirits arid phantoms. The Lord make His face to shine upon thee,<br>
when occupied in the law, and reveal to thee its secrets, and be merciful unto thee.<br>
The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee in thy prayer, and grant thee peace in thy end.<br>
And they shall bestow the benediction of My Name upon the children of Israel, and I, by My Word,<br>
will bless them.<br>

Back in the summer of 2025, and in September of 2025, I found myself having to walk to work early each morning, in the dark.<br>
There were beautiful stars, planets, various luminaries, the moon and a beautiful sunrise on many occasions.<br>
Each time, when I would walk to work in the dark, I would pray out loud a prayer based on the Bible passages that we have just now looked at.<br>

Here is a prayer like that, based on, especially,<br>
John 3:16, Romans 10:9 -- The Gospel<br>
Matthew 6:9-13 -- The Lord's Prayer<br>
Numbers 6 -- Verses 22 through 27 -- The Prayer given to Aharon and his sons -- The Priestly Blessing<br>
Ephesians 6: 10-19 -- the whole armour of God, BREED FETCH, and OFF.<br>
<br>
<br>
I pray to ELL-Low-Heem, the Most High ELL-Low-Heem, ELL-ELLE-On, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat,<br>
We believe that Yaw-Who-Wah sacrificed and gave us His son, the Son of ELL-Low-Heem, the son of ELL-ELLE-On, Yah-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>
We believe that Yaw-Who-Wah sacrificed and gave us His son so that whosoever believes in the son of ELL-Low-Heem shall not die, shall not perish, but shall have the gift of eternal life and everlasting life.<br>
<br>
We believe that Yah-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck is our Master, our Ah-Doe-Nye.<br>
We believe that the father Yaw-Who-Wah raised up His son, Yah-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck from the grave, and therefore we shall be saved.<br>
<br>
Heavenly Father, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat,<br>
may your name be hallowed, respected, honoured and glorified,<br>
may your Kingdom come soon, and be before us, upon us and within us,<br>
may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us this day, our daily bread, and provide for us today, everything that we need.<br>
Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.<br>
We thankfully receive your forgiveness.<br>
Help us forgive everyone who has ever sinned against us, and may we completely forgive everyone who has sinned against us, and caused us to become the victim of someone else's sin.<br>
<br>
Lead us not into temptation, but rescue us and deliver us from all evil, and the evil ones.<br>
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
bless us and keep us.<br>
May your face, your countenance, your spirit, your presence and your glory be upon us and within us.<br>
Enter into us and cleanse us, purify us and perfect us.<br>
<br>
Be merciful and gracious unto us. We need your mercy and grace.<br>

Heal our ears so we can hear your voice and obey you, and that we can always hear what the spirit is saying to the churches.<br>
Bless and heal and strengthen our delight in you Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
and may you delight yourself in us, your children, the children of ELL-ELLE-On.<br>
<br>
Bless and heal and strengthen our faith, our encouragement, our trust, our confidence and our hope in you, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
Help us obey you, and follow you, and fear you Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
You have given us the keys to the kingdom. Help us know how and when to use those keys,<br>
and when to bind up and prohibit what we should, and to let loose and set free what we should, and the wisdom on when we should and how we should use those keys to the kingdom.<br>
<br>
Thank you for giving us the full armour of ELL-Low-Heem. Bless our ability to learn from our good teacher, the son of ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
Thank you for the Good Shepherd, your son, and help us walk on that path of righteousness for your name's sake.<br>
We thankfully receive your righteousness, your salvation, your Yeh-Shoe-Uh.<br>
Thank you for being the stability of our times, the firm foundation, the solid rock of the chief cornerstone.<br>
We thank you for being our Torah giver, giving us the sword of the spirit, which is the word of ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
Show us how and when to use it, when we should put it into its sheath, and when we need to take it out and use it, and show us how and when to use it for victory.<br>
<br>
Save us, help us, heal us, provide for us, strengthen us, encourage us, help us receive more of your love, your joy and your peace.<br>
Help us praise and worship you, and help us rejoice in you, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>

Help us do a better job of loving one another, of loving our neighbour.<br>
Enter in and heal our body, our heart, our mind, our spirit and our soul.<br>
<br>
Give us strength and energy during the day, and lead us and guide us with truth and wisdom.<br>
At night, give us your comfort, your peace, and give us good sleep. Keep us safe, guard us and guide us, bless us and protect us.<br>

<br>

Rescue us from our stress, distress, our fear, anger, depression, oppression, sufferings, struggles, persecutions, failures and inadequacies.<br>
Save us from our own sin, and save us from all of the damages, injuries, injustices, and any painful abuse from being the victim of someone else's sin.<br>

<br>
Help me stop sinning, right now and every day from now on, and forevermore.<br>
<br>
<br>
In me, take my list of what I think is right and wrong, of what I think is good or evil, of what I think is important or not important, of what I think is valuable or worthless, and change all of those lists, so that they all completely match what you say, Yaw-Who Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, what you say is right or wrong, what you say is good or evil, what you say is important or not important, of what you say is valuable or worthless.<br>
<br>
Give me discernment, that I always immediately know what is truth, and what is a deception. Help me concentrate and focus on what is important right now, and help me not focus on distractions, strong delusions, deceptions, and lies.  Help me get on and stay on the right path at all times, and do not let me wander off of the righteous path that I need to stay on.<br>
<br>
You are the way that I should go. Help me not walk too fast or too slow. Help me not try to stop when I should keep going, and help me keep going even when I am tempted to stop or slow down. Let me not try to get closer to any person, place or object that I should stay away from, and help me not stay away from any person, place or object that I should try to get closer to.<br>
<br>
Don't let me walk through a door that I should not walk through, and don't let me fail to walk through a door that I should walk through. Help me not go in a wrong direction, and help me always travel in the best and right speed and direction that I should go, be it physically or electronically, or spiritually.<br>
<br>
Keep evil, wicked, unclean spirits away from me at all times, and in all paces and circumstances. Keep all witches and satanic people away from me and my family at all times, and in all paces and circumstances. May all curses, and hexes and charged objects be of no effect. Cancel and neutralise all thought-castings and all magical attacks, satanic attacks and witchcraft attacks, and neutralise all power of any magical arts.<br>
<br>
If anyone tries to approach me or my family in the form of an astral projection, may you automatically and immediately cut the silver cord, cut the silver cord of that person doing that astral projection, so that they will bounce and will not be able to return to their physical body, resulting in the physical death of their physical body.<br>
<br>
If anyone tries to open a door or portal or gateway of any kind into my room or location, and if that opening is not authorised by Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, and is not for for use by Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat's angel army, then, without hesitation, immediately close that door or portal or gateway of any kind, and go to the entity that tried to open that, and take away all of that entity's power and authority, so that it can never do that ever again.<br>
<br>
We plead the blood of Yah-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>
Thank you for your body, broken for us. Enter into us and save us. We do communion in remembrance of you dwelling inside of us.<br>
We thank you and we receive your body and your blood, we receive you, and we thank you for your life and the blood of the New Covenant, that causes all of our sin to go into remission.<br>
<br>
Thank you Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, for being our ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
Thank you for being our king.<br>
Thank you for being the stability of our times.<br>
Thank you for your promises of saving us, and rescuing us, being our deliverer that delivers us.<br>
Thank you for caring for us and thank you for carrying us.<br>
Thank you for giving us your only begotten son, Yah-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>
Thank you for giving us your advocate, your counsellor, the Roo-Awk Hawk-Oh-Desh.<br>
Help us repent and change direction in every area of our lives where repentance is needed.<br>
<br>
Heal us, remodel us, renovate us, rebuke and cast out anything in us that should not be in us, and create in us and strengthen within us whatever it is that we are lacking or missing.<br>
<br>
Forgive us.<br>
Please forgive me.<br>
<br>
Forgive me for all of my failures, all of my mistakes, and all of my sin.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your forgiveness. Thank you for giving us your mercy and grace.<br>
Thank you for forgiving us of our sins, and for cleansing us from all of our unrighteousness.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your mercy, your grace, your good favour, your pity and your compassions that fail not.<br>
We lift these prayers up to you,<br>
In the name of Yah-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck, Ah-Main.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
One of the very best examples in the Bible where it is clearly indicated that Jesus and God are one and the same, is when Thomas is looking right at Jesus, and is touching Jesus, and Thomas says right to the face of Jesus, "My Lord and my God!"<br>
Jesus does not deny it, He does not rebuke Thomas, Jesus does not correct Thomas or argue against what Thomas just declared.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 20:28 -- KJV<br>
And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 20:28 -- NLT<br>
"My Lord and my God!" Thomas exclaimed.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 20: 27-29 -- NLT<br>
27 Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Put your hand into the wound in my side. Don't be faithless any longer. Believe!"<br>
28 "My Lord and my God!" Thomas exclaimed.<br>
29 Then Jesus told him, "You believe because you have seen me. Blessed are those who believe without seeing me."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 20:28 -- TS2009<br>
And Toma answered and said to Him, "My Master and my ELL-Low-Heem!"<br>

<br>
Luke 6: 32-38 (KJV)<br>
6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.<br>
6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.<br>
6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.<br>
6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.<br>
6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.<br>
6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:<br>
6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 6: 32-38 -- NLT<br>
32 "If you love only those who love you, why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them!<br>
33 And if you do good only to those who do good to you, why should you get credit? Even sinners do that much!<br>
34 And if you lend money only to those who can repay you, why should you get credit? Even sinners will lend to other sinners for a full return.<br>
35 "Love your enemies! Do good to them. Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked.<br>
36 You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.<br>
37 "Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, or it will all come back against you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven.<br>
38 Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full -- pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap.<br>
The amount you give will determine the amount you get back."<br>
(The measure you give will be the measure you get back.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 6: 30-38 -- TS2009<br>
30 "And give to everyone who asks of you. And from him who takes away what is yours do not ask it back.<br>
31 "And as you wish men should do to you, you also do to them in the same way.<br>
32 "And if you love those loving you, what favour have you? For sinners, too, love those loving them.<br>
33 "And if you do good to those doing good to you, what favour have you? For even sinners do the same.<br>
34 "And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive back, what favour have you? For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much back.<br>
35 Rather, love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting none in return. And your reward shall be great, and you shall be sons of ELL-ELLE-ON. Because He is kind to the thankless and wicked ones.<br>
36 "Therefore be compassionate, as your Father also is compassionate.<br>
37 "And do not judge, and you shall not be judged at all. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned at all. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.<br>
38 Give, and it shall be given to you. A good measure, pressed down and shaken together and running over shall be put into your lap. For with the same measure with which you measure, it shall be measured back to you.<br>

Ecclesiastes 1: 8 & 9 -- NLT<br>
8 Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content.<br>

<br>
Commentary:<br>
The ouroboros is an ancient symbol depicting a snake or dragon eating its own tail.<br>
The ouroboros entered Western tradition via ancient Egyptian iconography and the Greek magical tradition.<br>
It was adopted as a symbol in Gnosticism (a general collection of religious and philosophical ideas)<br>
and Hermeticism,<br>
(a philosophical and religious tradition rooted in the teachings attributed to Hermes, which is<br>
a combination of different beliefs and various schools of thought, combining the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth)<br>
and, most notably, in alchemy (mixing science, medicine and chemistry with magic, witchcraft, wizardry, and sorcery).<br>
Some snakes, such as rat snakes, have been known to consume themselves.<br>
<br>
In Ancient Egypt, The ouroboros is depicted twice on the figure of Ra-Osiris (Osiris born again as Ra, from Ra's union with Osiris in the underworld).<br>
The whole divine figure represents the beginning and the end of time.<br>
<br>
The ouroboros, symbolised by a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, indeed has significant associations with time, often representing cyclicality and eternity.<br>
<br>
The ouroboros embodies the concept of cycles, such as birth, death, and rebirth. This cyclical nature suggests that time is not linear but rather a continuous loop, where endings lead to new beginnings.<br>
<br>
In philosophical contexts, particularly within ancient Egyptian and Greco-Roman traditions, the ouroboros illustrates the idea of eternal return. This notion implies that history and existence repeat themselves infinitely, highlighting an unending cycle of time.<br>
<br>
In alchemy, the ouroboros symbolises the cyclical process of transformation. It reflects the idea that spiritual and physical processes evolve through cycles, emphasising a journey through different states over time.<br>
<br>
Eastern philosophies, such as those in Hinduism and Buddhism, often view time in a non-linear fashion, akin to the ouroboros. The symbolism illustrates the interconnection of past, present, and future.<br>
<br>
The ouroboros serves as a powerful symbol of time, reflecting concepts of cycles, eternity, and transformation. Its representation invites contemplation on the nature of existence and the passage of time.<br>
<br>
Are you wearing a symbol of ouroboros right now? Look at your wristwatch. How is it being fastened to your wrist?<br>
<br>
Is the tail of the belt going into the head, the buckle of the belt?  Are belts, and the belt that holds a wristwatch to the wrist, is it a symbol of ouroboros?<br>
<br>
That analogy suggests that belts and watchbands, like the ouroboros, form a closed loop. When a belt's tail goes into its buckle, it creates a circular shape that can be likened to the serpent consuming its own tail. This circularity can symbolise continuity and the cyclical nature of time.<br>
<br>
When a watch is fastened to the wrist with a band that loops back into itself, it does mirror the ouroboros concept. Here, the wristwatch can symbolise the cyclical nature of time, as it continuously tracks the passing moments.<br>
<br>
<br>
The KJV Bible indicates that our Father God and His Son, Our Master and Creator, Jesus Christ, hold masterful control over time, with specific verses from Ecclesiastes, Acts, and Daniel explicitly addressing God's sovereignty over the times and seasons.<br>
<br>
We have looked at these Bible verses before, in the Parallel Bible, Chapter Zero. Let's look at them again...<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 3:1 -- KJV<br>
To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven....<br>
<br>
Acts 1:7 -- KJV<br>
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.<br>
<br>

Let's look at the online Dictionaries of<br>
Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins, and Oxford,<br>
and see what they said back in November of 2025<br>
regarding the definition of the word, reproach.<br>
reproach, means,<br>
criticism, blame, or disapproval<br>
to express disapproval of, or disappointment with, someone for a fault or some wrong done.<br>
to blame someone.<br>
a rebuke or expression of disappointment.<br>
a cause of disgrace or shame.<br>
to criticise someone, especially for not being successful or not doing what is expected.<br>
something that you say or do to criticise someone,<br>
especially for not being successful or for not doing what is expected.<br>
If you reproach someone, you say or show that you are disappointed, upset, or angry because they have done something wrong.<br>
If you look at or speak to someone with reproach, you show or say that you are disappointed, upset, or angry because they have done something wrong.<br>
If you reproach yourself, you think with regret about something you have done wrong.<br>
If you consider someone's actions or behaviour to be a reproach to a group of people, you consider them to be harmful or insulting to that group.<br>
blame or criticism for something you have done,<br>
a word or remark expressing blame or criticism,<br>
a state of shame or loss of honour,<br>
a person or thing that brings shame on somebody/something.<br>
<br>
We will see the use of the word, reproach,<br>
when we read Psalms 57:3, here, in just a moment.<br>

Psalms 56:12 -- KJV<br>

Let's read the end of Psalms 56, and all of Psalms 57.<br>
We will be reading the last six verses of Psalms 56, and all eleven verses of Psalms 57.<br>
Psalms 56, starting at verse 8, and we keep reading into the next Psalm, Psalms 57, and we read all eleven verses of Psalms 57.<br>

<br>
(He shall send from heaven, and save me. He reproacheth him that would swallow me up.)<br>
57:3 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.<br>

57:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.<br>
57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.<br>

Psalms 57 is a miktam of David. A miktam of David may be a literary or musical term.<br>
Psalms 57 is a psalm of David, regarding the time he fled from Saul and went into the cave.<br>

<br>
<br>
Psalms 56: 4-13, and all of Psalms 57 -- NLT<br>
4<br>
I praise God for what he has promised.<br>
I trust in God, so why should I be afraid?<br>
What can mere mortals do to me?<br>
5<br>
They are always twisting what I say;<br>
they spend their days plotting to harm me.<br>
6<br>
They come together to spy on me --<br>
watching my every step, eager to kill me.<br>
7<br>
Don’t let them get away with their wickedness;<br>
in your anger, O God, bring them down.<br>
8<br>
(You keep track of all my wanderings.)<br>
You keep track of all my sorrows.<br>
You have collected all my tears in your bottle.<br>
You have recorded each one in your book.<br>
9<br>
My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help.<br>
This I know: God is on my side!<br>
10<br>
I praise God for what he has promised;<br>
yes, I praise the Lord for what he has promised.<br>
11<br>
I trust in God, so why should I be afraid?<br>
What can mere mortals do to me?<br>
12<br>
I will fulfil my vows to you, O God,<br>
and will offer a sacrifice of thanks for your help.<br>
13<br>
For you have rescued me from death;<br>
you have kept my feet from slipping.<br>
So now I can walk in your presence, O God,<br>
in your life-giving light.<br>
1<br>
Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy!<br>
I look to you for protection.<br>
I will hide beneath the shadow of your wings<br>
until the danger passes by.<br>
2<br>
(I cry out to ELL-ELLE-On,)<br>
(I cry out to ELL-Low-Heem-ELLE-On,)<br>
I cry out to God Most High,<br>
to God who will fulfil his purpose for me.<br>
3<br>
He will send help from heaven to rescue me,<br>
disgracing those who hound me.<br>
<br>
Interlude (Selah.)<br>
<br>
My God will send forth his unfailing love and faithfulness.<br>
4<br>
I am surrounded by fierce lions<br>
who greedily devour human prey --<br>
whose teeth pierce like spears and arrows,<br>
and whose tongues cut like swords.<br>
5<br>
Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens!<br>
May your glory shine over all the earth.<br>
6<br>
My enemies have set a trap for me.<br>
I am weary from distress.<br>
They have dug a deep pit in my path,<br>
but they themselves have fallen into it.<br>
<br>
Interlude<br>
<br>
7<br>
My heart is confident in you, O God;<br>
my heart is confident.<br>
No wonder I can sing your praises!<br>
8<br>
Wake up, my heart!<br>
Wake up, O lyre and harp!<br>
I will wake the dawn with my song.<br>
9<br>
I will thank you, Lord, amongst all the people.<br>
I will sing your praises amongst the nations.<br>
10<br>
For your unfailing love is as high as the heavens.<br>
Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.<br>
11<br>
Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens.<br>
May your glory shine over all the earth.<br>

Psalms 56: 3-13, and all of Psalms 57 -- TS2009<br>
3 In the day I am afraid, I trust in You.<br>
4 In ELL-Low-Heem, whose Word I praise, In ELL-Low-Heem I have trusted; I do not fear; What could flesh do to me?<br>
5 All day long they twist my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.<br>
6 They stir up strife, they hide, They watch my steps, As they lie in wait for my life.<br>
7 Because of wickedness, cast them out. Put down the peoples in displeasure, O ELL-Low-Heem!<br>
8 You have counted my wanderings; You put my tears into Your bottle; Are they not in Your book?<br>
9 My enemies turn back in the day I call; This I know, because ELL-Low-Heem is for me.<br>
10 In ELL-Low-Heem, whose Word I praise, In Yaw-Who-Wah, whose Word I praise,<br>
11 In ELL-Low-Heem I have trusted; I do not fear; What could man do to me?<br>
12 On me, O ELL-Low-Heem, are Your vows; I render praises to You,<br>
13 For You have delivered my life from death, My feet from stumbling, That I might walk before ELL-Low-Heem, In the light of the living!<br>
1 Show me favour, O ELL-Low-Heem, show me favour! For in You my being is taking refuge; And in the shadow of Your wings I take refuge, Until destruction passes by.<br>
2 I cry out to (ELL-ELLE-On) the Most High ELL-Low-Heem, To ELL who is perfecting all matters for me.<br>
3 He sends from the heavens and saves me; He reproaches the one who would swallow me up. Selah. ELL-Low-Heem sends forth His loving-commitment and His truth.<br>
4 My being is in the midst of lions; I lie amongst those who breathe fire, Whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue is a sharp sword.<br>
5 Be exalted, O ELL-Low-Heem, above the heavens; Let Your esteem be above all the earth.<br>
6 They have prepared a net for my footsteps; My being was bowed down; They have dug a pit before me; They fell into the midst of it! Selah.<br>
7 My heart is firm, O ELL-Low-Heem, My heart is firm; I sing and praise.<br>
8 Awake, my esteem! Awake, harp and lyre! I awake the dawn.<br>
9 I praise You amongst the peoples, O Yaw-Who-Wah; I sing to You amongst the nations.<br>
10 For Your loving-commitment is great up to the heavens, And Your truth unto the clouds.<br>
11 Be exalted above the heavens, O ELL-Low-Heem; Let Your esteem be above all the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Before we bring this Bible study to a close, I just wanted to point out one beautiful thing that caught my eye as we were studying this.<br>
<br>
Consider again, just this one verse right here. Psalms 56:13.<br>
Here it is again...<br>
<br>
Psalms 56:13 -- TS2009<br>
For You have delivered my life from death, My feet from stumbling, That I might walk before ELL-Low-Heem, In the light of the living!<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 56:13 -- NLT<br>
For you have rescued me from death;<br>
you have kept my feet from slipping.<br>
So now I can walk in your presence, O God,<br>
in your life-giving light.<br>
<br>
The punctuation was not originally there. These translation teams added the punctuation for their English translations.<br>
<br>
I really like the way how the KJV translation team did it...<br>
<br>
Psalms 56:13 -- KJV<br>
For thou hast delivered my soul from death:<br>
wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling,<br>
that I may walk before God in the light of the living?<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
I love how they ended it with a question mark.<br>
Here is what I was thinking of as I was reading that in the KJV.<br>
It was like the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah was speaking to me as I was reading that verse.<br>
It felt like He was saying this to me in this manner...<br>
Through the sacrifice of my only begotten Son, I have rescued you and I have delivered you from death and from having to go to an actual, real place known as hell.<br>
I made sure that you will not die and that you will be with me forever in my Kingdom that I am giving to you forever as an inheritance.<br>
If I have already made that a done deal through the blood of my Son, do you think I can also help you, and rescue you, day after day, so that you do not stumble and fall?<br>
If I can make sure that you never die and go to hell, do you think I am strong enough and smart enough to help you get through each day?<br>
If I can make sure that you live forever with me in heaven, will I not also help you walk through each day without letting you stumble and fall?<br>
If I can do a big thing, like making sure you receive the gift of eternal life, will I not also rescue you from the smaller things; will I not also help you not trip and stumble as you walk through each day?<br>
If I can do a big thing, rescuing you from death, so that you will never experience death, will I not also do the small and easy things, like making sure your needs are met, making sure you walk through and step through each day without stumbling and falling, providing for you, protecting you, making your feet sure-footed on a firm foundation, sure-footed as a deer?<br>
<br>
If I can do this big thing for you, if my Son can do that big thing for you on that cross, am I not also going to help you with the smaller things every day?<br>
If I took care of that big thing for you, will I not take care of the smaller things for you, every day?<br>

14:10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?<br>
14:11 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:<br>
14:12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.<br>
14:13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!<br>

1 Corinthians 15: 48-55 -- KJV<br>
15:48 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.<br>
15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.<br>
15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.<br>
15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,<br>
15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.<br>
15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.<br>
15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.<br>
15:55 O death, where is thy sting?<br>
(O hell, where is thy victory?)<br>
O grave, where is thy victory?<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 15: 45-57 -- NLT<br>
45 The Scriptures tell us,<br>
(in Genesis 2:7)<br>
"The first man, Adam, became a living person." But the last Adam -- that is, Christ -- is a life-giving Spirit.<br>
46 What comes first is the natural body, then the spiritual body comes later.<br>
47 Adam, the first man, was made from the dust of the earth, whilst Christ, the second man, came from heaven.<br>
48 Earthly people are like the earthly man, and heavenly people are like the heavenly man.<br>
(Just as we are now like the earthly man, let us be like the heavenly man.)<br>
49 Just as we are now like the earthly man, we will someday be like the heavenly man.<br>
<br>
50 What I am saying, dear brothers and sisters, is that our physical bodies cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. These dying bodies cannot inherit what will last forever.<br>
51 But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!<br>
52 It will happen in a moment, in the blink of an eye, when the last trumpet is blown. For when the trumpet sounds, those who have died will be raised to live forever. And we who are living will also be transformed.<br>
53 For our dying bodies must be transformed into bodies that will never die; our mortal bodies must be transformed into immortal bodies.<br>
<br>
(This next verse, verse 54, is quoting from Isaiah 25:8, and then, the next verse after that, verse 55, is quoting from the Greek version of Hosea 13:14.)<br>
<br>
54 Then, when our dying bodies have been transformed into bodies that will never die,<br>
(and our mortal bodies have been transformed into immortal bodies,)<br>
this Scripture will be fulfilled:<br>
"Death is swallowed up in victory.<br>
55<br>
O death, where is your victory?<br>
O death, where is your sting?"<br>
56 For sin is the sting that results in death, and the law gives sin its power.<br>
57 But thank God! He gives us victory over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 15: 45-57 -- TS2009<br>
45 And so it has been written, (in Genesis 2:7) "The first man Ah-Dome became a living being," the last Ah-Dome a life-giving Spirit.<br>
46 The spiritual, however, was not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.<br>
47 The first man was of the earth, earthy; the second Man is the Master from heaven.<br>
48 As is the earthy, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly.<br>
49 And as we have borne the likeness of the earthy, we shall also bear the likeness of the heavenly.<br>
50 And this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood is unable to inherit the reign of ELL-Low-Heem, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.<br>
51 See, I speak a secret to you: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,<br>
52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.<br>
53 For this corruptible has to put on incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality.<br>
<br>
(This next verse, verse 54, is quoting from Isaiah 25:8, and then, the next verse after that, verse 55, is quoting from Hosea 13:14.)<br>
<br>
54 And when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall come to be the word that has been written, "Death is swallowed up in overcoming."<br>
55 "O Death, where is your sting? O Sheol, where is your overcoming?"<br>
56 And the sting of death is the sin, and the power of the sin is the Torah.<br>
57 But thanks to ELL-Low-Heem who gives us the overcoming through our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck (Lord Jesus Messiah).<br>

Commentary:<br>
First Corinthians is a letter by the Apostle Paul addressing the church in Corinth, focusing on issues of division, immorality, and spiritual gifts. Paul emphasises the importance of love, instructs on proper worship practices, and provides guidance on resurrection and the Lord's Supper. He seeks to unify the believers and correct misunderstandings about Christian living, presenting a robust view of the Gospel and moral conduct necessary for the community of faith. The overarching theme is the call to live out the Christian faith authentically amid cultural challenges.<br>
<br>
Second Corinthians is a letter from Paul to the church in Corinth, addressing his authority as an apostle and defending his ministry against false teachers. He expresses his deep emotions, recounts sufferings, and celebrates reconciliation. Paul discusses the nature of true Christian leadership and the importance of generosity, urging the church to support the impoverished believers in Jerusalem. The letter highlights the transformative power of Christ and the significance of enduring hardships for the sake of the Gospel, ultimately calling for unity and sincerity amongst the believers.<br>
<br>
Third Corinthians is a letter attributed to Paul, emphasising the significance of Christ's resurrection and refuting false teachings in the Corinthian church. Paul urges believers to recognise the true nature of redemption through Jesus, affirming that God sent His Spirit to redeem humanity. He stresses the reality of resurrection, using examples from scripture to illustrate God's power to raise the dead, promising eternal life for believers. Additionally, the letter warns against doctrines that deny foundational truths of faith and encourages living according to the teachings of Christ and the prophets, reminding Christians of their identity as children of God.<br>
<br>
We will read here, next, the text known as Third Corinthians, provided to us by Paul Pavao.<br>
<br>
As of November 2025, in Memphis, Tennessee, we find a man there by the name of Paul Pavao.<br>
He is an Author, Christian Historian, Teacher, Church Leader, and an Advocate for Early Christian Writings.<br>
<br>
Paul Pavao moved to Memphis, Tennessee in August 2013 to be with two other couples involved in the church that he leads now, Rose Creek Village, in Selmer, Tennessee.<br>
<br>
Selmer, Tennessee is about 98 miles east of Memphis, Tennessee.<br>
<br>
As of November of 2025, Paul Pavao continues to be a dedicated Christian and author with over 43 years of experience studying early church writings and defending the foundational tenets of the Christian faith.<br>
<br>
Having survived leukaemia and secondary lymphoma, he continues to thrive and actively contribute to Christian discourse through his website.<br>
His website is titled, Christian History for Everyman.<br>
The website is located here...<br>
<a href="https://www.christian-history.org/">https://www.christian-history.org/</a><br>
<br>
This platform aims to provide valuable insights into early Christian history whilst promoting a spirit of unity amongst believers, emphasising the need for spiritual, rather than doctrinal, cohesion.<br>
<br>
Pavao's journey includes participating in unique church experiences, advocating for the original faith, and engaging in Bible study that focuses on love and community.<br>
<br>
He firmly believes that true unity stems from the Spirit of God, not merely agreement on doctrine.<br>
<br>
His content encourages readers to develop a love for church history and remains committed to equipping them for good works rooted in a genuine faith.<br>
<br>
Paul Pavao has found and does provide on his website, the book of 3rd Corinthians.<br>
<br>
The book of 3rd Corinthians is found here...<br>
<a href="https://www.christian-history.org/3rd-corinthians.html">https://www.christian-history.org/3rd-corinthians.html</a><br>
<br>
This English translation of 3rd Corinthians was originally released in 1924 by Montague Rhodes James, also known as M. R. James.<br>
Montague Rhodes James was born in 1862, and he passed away in 1936.<br>
He was an English medievalist scholar and author, especially studying the medieval period from the 5th to the late 15th centuries, and his scholarly work is still highly regarded,<br>
but he is best remembered for his ghost stories, which are considered by many critics and authors as the finest in the English language<br>
and widely influential on modern horror.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The book of 3rd Corinthians is The Third Epistle to the Corinthians.<br>
We really do not know who wrote the book known as 3rd Corinthians.<br>
One might think that is was written by Paul the Apostle.<br>
There are some arguments against this being true.<br>
To Paul, flesh is one of the negative aspects of human sin and temptation<br>
that are left behind; but the body of Christians will be resurrected.<br>
In 3 Corinthians, however, flesh is given an unambiguous positive connotation:<br>
the flesh of believers will be resurrected,<br>
in contradiction to Paul's claim that<br>
"flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God"<br>
which is what we see Paul saying in 1 Corinthians 15:50.<br>
If written by Paul, the letter is believed to have been composed in the first century,<br>
likely around the years of 55 to 60 AD.<br>
This is inferred based on the context of the issues addressed,<br>
which align with the historical struggles of the early church in Corinth.<br>
<br>
Generally, the Greek manuscripts of 3rd Corinthians are considered the most authoritative for textual analysis, as they are closer to the presumed original. However, the absence of a universally accepted version means that interpretations can vary depending on theological perspectives and scholarly approaches.<br>
<br>
Paul Pavao provides the entire text of 3 Corinthians.<br>
It does not have any verse numbers.<br>
<br>
Paul Pavao did perform some editing to his text that he provides.<br>
He tried to update the language where the wording was awkward.<br>
The words within the squared brackets are not found in all of the versions of this text.<br>
His text also includes some notes that were provided by Montague Rhodes James.<br>
<br>
<br>
From Paul Pavao's webpage, here is the complete text of 3 Corinthians.<br>
This comes from the 1924 English translation by Montague Rhodes James.<br>
Paul Pavao's editing and some notes from Montague Rhodes James are included.<br>
Since this text contains some examples from scripture, we will also insert here some Bible references here, as we read.<br>
<br>
Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, unto the brethren which are in Corinth, greeting.<br>
<br>
Being in the midst of many tribulations, I do not marvel if the teachings of the evil one spread quickly. For my Lord Jesus Christ will hasten his coming, and will set at nought (no longer endure the insolence of) them that falsify his words.<br>
<br>
For I delivered to you in the beginning the things which I received of the [holy] apostles which were before me, who were at all times with Jesus Christ:<br>
namely, that our Lord Jesus Christ was born of Mary [who is] of the seed of David [according to the flesh] (Luke 1:26-35),<br>
<br>
the Holy Spirit being sent forth from heaven from the Father to her [by the angel Gabriel], so that he might come down into this world and redeem all flesh by his flesh, and raise us up from the dead in the flesh, just as he has shown us in himself as an example.<br>
<br>
And because man was formed by his Father, therefore was [mankind] sought when he was lost, that he might be made alive by adoption.<br>
For to this end did God Almighty who made heaven and earth first send the prophets to the Jews (Isaiah 6:8-10),<br>
that they might be drawn away from their sins. For he planned to save the house of Israel. Therefore he conferred a portion of the spirit of Christ upon the prophets and sent them to the Jews first [or to the first Jews], and they proclaimed the true worship of God for a long period of time.<br>
<br>
But the prince of iniquity, desiring to be God, laid hands on them and slew them [banished them from God], and bound all flesh by evil lusts [and the end of the world by judgement drew near].<br>
<br>
But God Almighty, who is righteous, would not cast away his own creation, [but had compassion on them from heaven] and sent his spirit into Mary [in Galilee], [who believed with all her heart and received the Holy Spirit in her womb, so that Jesus might come into the world], so that by that flesh whereby that wicked one had brought in death [had triumphed], by the same he should be shown to be overcome.<br>
<br>
For by his own body Jesus Christ saved all flesh [and restored it to life], so that he might show forth the temple of righteousness in his body, in whom [or whereby] we are saved [, in whom if we believe we are set free].<br>
<br>
They therefore [or Know therefore that they or They therefore who agree with them] are not children of righteousness, but children of wrath who reject the wisdom of God, saying that the heaven and the earth and all that are in them are not the work of God. [They therefore are the children of wrath], for cursed are they, following the teaching of the serpent, whom you should drive out and flee from their doctrine. [For you are not children of disobedience, but of the well-beloved church. Therefore, the time of the resurrection is proclaimed to everyone.]<br>
<br>
And as for that which they say, that there is no resurrection of the flesh (Job 14:12-14),<br>
they indeed shall have no resurrection [to life, but to judgement] because they do not believe in him that is risen from the dead, [not believing nor understanding]. For they do not know, O Corinthians, the seeds of wheat or of other seeds, how they are cast bare into the earth and are corrupted and rise again by the will of God with bodies and clothed. And not only that [body] which is cast in rises again, but many times more blessing itself.<br>
<br>
And if we must not take an example from seeds [only, but from more noble bodies],<br>
you know how Jonah the son of Amathi (Jonah 1:17) --<br>
when he would not preach to them of Nineveh, [but fled] -- was swallowed by the sea-monster. After three days and three nights God heard the prayer of Jonah out of the lowest hell, and no part of him was consumed, not even a hair nor an eyelash.<br>
<br>
How much more, [oh you of little faith], shall he raise you that have believed in Christ Jesus, just as he himself arose.<br>
In the same way, (in 2 Kings 13:21) a dead man also was cast upon the bones of the prophet Elisha by the children of Israel, and he arose, both body and soul and bones and spirit [or arose in his body]. How much more shall you who have been cast upon the body and bones and spirit of the Lord [or How much more, oh you of little faith, shall you which have been cast on him] rise again in that day having your flesh whole, [just as he rose]?<br>
<br>
[In the same way, concerning the prophet Elijah, (actually it was Elisha, a successor to Elijah,) he raised up the widow's son from death.<br>
(2 Kings 4:32-37)<br>
<br>
How much more shall the Lord Jesus raise you up from death at the sound of the trumpet,<br>
(1 Thessalonians 4:16)<br>
<br>
in the twinkling of an eye?<br>
(1 Corinthians 15:52)<br>
<br>
For he has shown us an example in his own body.]<br>
<br>
If, then, you receive any other doctrine, [God shall be a witness against you]. Let no man trouble me, for I bear these bonds that I may win Christ.<br>
I therefore bear his marks in my body so that I may attain to the resurrection of the dead (1 Thessalonians 4:16).<br>
Whoever receives [or abides in] the rule which he has received by the blessed prophets and the holy Gospel shall receive a reward from the Lord, [and when he rises from the dead shall obtain eternal life]. But whoever transgresses these things, with him is the fire, and with those that walk in the same way, which are a generation of vipers [or who are men without God], whom you must reject in the power of the Lord, and peace, [grace, and love] shall be with you.<br>

Revelation 18 talks about<br>
The Fall of Babylon<br>
<br>
Revelation 18:23 (KJV)<br>
and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee;<br>
and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee:<br>
for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 18:23 -- NLT<br>
The light of a lamp<br>
will never shine in you again.<br>
The happy voices of brides and grooms<br>
will never be heard in you again.<br>
For your merchants were the greatest in the world,<br>
and you deceived the nations with your sorceries.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 18:23 -- TS2009<br>
"And the light of a lamp shall not shine in you any more at all.<br>
And the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not be heard in you any more at all.<br>
For your merchants were the great ones of the earth, for by your drug sorcery all the nations were led astray.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The TS2009 translation team decided to say, drug sorcery. Is that accurate?<br>
<br>
<br>
We consult once again our usual collection of New Testament reference materials, which mainly include...<br>
The Strong's concordance,<br>
Strong's Greek Dictionary provided by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen from Michael Grier's e-text,<br>
Public Domain Greek-English lexicon by John Jeffrey Dodson (2010),<br>
Thayer's Lexicon prepared by Alan Bunning, from the Centre for New Testament Restoration,<br>
and the Tyndale Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Greek - from Tyndale House, in Cambridge.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 18:23<br>
the word right there for, sorceries,<br>
that Greek word is pronounced, Far-Mar-Kye-Yuh.<br>
This Greek word, Far-Mar-Kye-Yuh; here is what it means...<br>
<br>
sorcery, magical arts, often found in connection with idolatry and fostered by it,<br>
the deceptions and seductions of idolatry,<br>
poisoning,<br>
the use or the administering of drugs,<br>
medication,<br>
pharmacy,<br>
magic,<br>
sorcery, witchcraft,<br>
the use of drugs, potions, spells,<br>
magic, sorcery, enchantment,<br>
medication ("pharmacy"),<br>
to administer drugs,<br>
generally, the use of medicine, drugs or spells,<br>
poisoning, sorcery, witchcraft.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When I think of pharmacy and pharmaceuticals, this Biblical definition presents a perspective that,<br>
pharmacy and pharmaceuticals might be satanic. This would include all pills, medicines and injections of all kinds.<br>
Is it possible for any of these statements to be true?<br>
The people that run the drug companies all belong to secret brotherhoods and secret societies which are all satanic.<br>
The people that control what is and what is not taught at medical schools all belong to secret brotherhoods and secret societies which are all satanic.<br>
The medical doctors all received bad programming from these medical schools, colleges and universities, which are all controlled by those that all belong to secret brotherhoods and secret societies which are all satanic.<br>
The advice that one receives from a medical doctor comes from those that all belong to secret brotherhoods and secret societies which are all satanic.<br>
All pharmacy and pharmaceutical pills, medicines and injections of all kinds, all come from those that all belong to secret brotherhoods and secret societies which are all satanic.<br>
<br>
If this perspective is true, then we could look at this word, sorceries, and perhaps we could just replace it with the word, pharmaceuticals.<br>
This would include all pills, medicines and injections of all kinds.<br>
<br>
So, there in Revelation 18:23, we could think about it like this...<br>
KJV: ...for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy pharmaceuticals were all nations deceived.<br>
NLT: ...For your merchants were the greatest in the world, and you deceived the nations with your pharmaceuticals.<br>
TS2009: ...For your merchants were the great ones of the earth, for by your pharmaceuticals all the nations were led astray.<br>
<br>
Can you think of any time where everyone was being forced to receive some kind of pharmaceutical something?<br>

About three-quarters of the way into Christian Essays 4,<br>
there was a moment there, where we looked at<br>
Four Christian Hits.<br>
It was at that time that we talked about MercyMe<br>
and their famous song, I Can Only Imagine, which was released in 1999 and again in 2001.<br>
<br>
MercyMe is an American contemporary Christian music band,<br>

11 studio albums, two compilation albums, two video albums, and 28 singles.<br>
They were continuing to actively release material in 2025,<br>
including one album and two singles in 2025.<br>

One of their early releases, besides the famous, I Can Only Imagine,<br>
was a song, titled, Here with Me.<br>

Here With Me was released on their album, Undone.<br>

<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2004 song, Here With Me, by MercyMe.<br>
<br>
<br>
I long for your embrace<br>
Every single day<br>
To meet you in this place<br>

Reveal yourself to me<br>
Because of your mercy<br>
I fall down on my knees<br>

Suddenly I'm lost within your beauty<br>
Caught up in the wonder of your touch<br>
Here in this moment I surrender to your love<br>

You're everywhere I go<br>
I am not alone<br>

Would choose to light the way<br>
For my ever wandering heart?<br>
<br>
Not because of who I am<br>
But because of what you've done<br>
Not because of what I've done<br>
But because of who you are<br>
<br>
<br>
I am a flower quickly fading<br>
Here today and gone tomorrow<br>
A wave tossed in the ocean (ocean)<br>
A vapor in the wind<br>
Still you hear me when I'm calling<br>
Lord, you catch me when I'm falling<br>
And you've told me who I am<br>
I am yours<br>
I am yours<br>
<br>
<br>
Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin<br>
Would look on me with love<br>
And watch me rise again?<br>
Who am I, that the voice that calmed the sea<br>
Would call out through the rain<br>
And calm the storm in me?<br>
<br>
Not because of who I am<br>
But because of what you've done<br>
Not because of what I've done<br>
But because of who you are<br>
<br>
<br>
I am a flower quickly fading<br>
Here today and gone tomorrow<br>
A wave tossed in the ocean (ocean)<br>
A vapour in the wind<br>
Still you hear me when I'm calling<br>
Lord, you catch me when I'm falling<br>
And you've told me who I am (I am)<br>
I am yours<br>
<br>
<br>
Not because of who I am<br>
But because of what you've done<br>
Not because of what I've done<br>
But because of who you are<br>
<br>
I am a flower quickly fading<br>
Here today and gone tomorrow<br>
A wave tossed in the ocean (ocean)<br>
A vapour in the wind<br>
Still you hear me when I'm calling<br>
Lord, you catch me when I'm falling<br>
You've told me who I am (I am)<br>
I am yours (I am yours)<br>
<br>
I am yours<br>
I am yours<br>
<br>
Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear?<br>
'Cause I am yours<br>
I am yours<br>

The first album of Casting Crowns was released on 7 October 2003.<br>
The third single released from this album was the song, Voice of Truth, which was released as a single on 18 September 2004.<br>
<br>
The song references two stories in the Bible...<br>
Peter walking on the water to Jesus, in Matthew 14:22-34,<br>
and David defeating Goliath in the first book of Samuel, Chapter 17.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Voice of Truth" is a song recorded by Casting Crowns, written by Mark Hall and Steven Curtis Chapman.<br>
It was the third song released from Casting Crowns' 2003 debut album, Casting Crowns.<br>
"Voice of Truth" reached number one on the<br>
Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart in 2003<br>
and remained in the top spot for 14 weeks.<br>
<br>
The Album Version of "Voice of Truth" was featured in the<br>
2006 movie, Facing the Giants.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the noughties (2000 to 2010), the Air1 Christian radio network began as a Christian rock-formatted radio network with the slogan "The Positive Alternative".<br>
When Voice of Truth was released, it was also remixed into a Rock Version, giving it a strong rock guitar sound with a heavier bass.<br>
The Rock Version was played and enjoyed many, many times on the Air1 Christian radio network.<br>
However, it was nearly impossible to find this remix anywhere else.<br>
It was not until 2024, when the rock version started to become available online.<br>
It may also be known as the Christian Hits Radio Mix, or the CHR Mix, or the Radio Edit CHR Mix.<br>
This means that there are three different versions of this song.<br>
There is the album version, a radio edit of the album version, and a remix radio edit, known as this CHR Mix or Rock Version.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2003 song, Voice of Truth, by Casting Crowns...<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh what I would do to have<br>
The kind of faith it takes to climb out of this boat I'm in<br>
Onto the crashing waves<br>
<br>
To step out of my comfort zone<br>
Into the realm of the unknown where Jesus is<br>
And He's holding out his hand<br>
<br>
But the waves are calling out my name and they laugh at me<br>
Reminding me of all the times I've tried before and failed<br>
The waves they keep on telling me<br>
Time and time again, "Boy, you'll never win!"<br>
"You'll never win"<br>
<br>
But the voice of truth tells me a different story<br>
And the voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid!"<br>
And the voice of truth says, "This is for My glory"<br>
Out of all the voices calling out to me<br>
I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh what I would do to have<br>
The kind of strength it takes to stand before a giant<br>
With just a sling and a stone<br>
Surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors<br>
Shaking in their armour<br>
Wishing they'd have had the strength to stand<br>
<br>
But the giant's calling out my name and he laughs at me<br>
Reminding me of all the times I've tried before and failed<br>
The giant keeps on telling me<br>
Time and time again, "Boy, you'll never win!"<br>
"You'll never win"<br>
<br>
But the voice of truth tells me a different story<br>
And the voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid!"<br>
And the voice of truth says, "This is for My glory"<br>
Out of all the voices calling out to me (Calling out to me)<br>
I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth<br>
<br>
<br>
But the stone was just the right size<br>
To put the giant on the ground<br>
And the waves they don't seem so high<br>
From on top of them looking down<br>
I will soar with the wings of eagles<br>
When I stop and listen to the sound of Jesus<br>
Singing over me<br>
<br>
The voice of truth tells me a different story<br>
The voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid!"<br>
And the voice of truth says, "This is for My glory"<br>
Out of all the voices calling out to me (calling out to me)<br>
<br>
I will choose to listen and believe<br>
(I will choose to listen and believe)<br>
I will choose to listen and believe<br>
The voice of truth<br>
<br>
I will listen and believe<br>
I will listen and believe the voice of truth<br>
<br>
I will listen and believe<br>
Because Jesus you are the voice of truth<br>
And I will listen to you<br>
You are<br>

We got dust on our Bibles<br>
Brand new iPhones<br>
No wonder why we feel this way<br>
<br>
Hey, how you been?<br>
It's been a while and I'm just checking in<br>
I miss the way things used to be back in 2017<br>
And I just miss my friend<br>
<br>
Hey, I've been fine<br>
I've been struggling to find some peace of mind<br>
It's the problem of our nation and in our generation<br>
We're too busy and can't find the time<br>
Are we busy or is it all a lie?<br>
<br>
We got dust on our Bibles<br>
Brand new iPhones<br>
No wonder why we feel this way<br>
We walk with our eyes closed<br>
Blind leading blind folk<br>
I'm done with those idols and dusty Bibles<br>
<br>
<br>
You only get this one life<br>
I don't wanna sit and watch it pass me by<br>
I'm so done being complacent<br>
'Cause there ain't no replacement<br>
For a life in the light of your way<br>
Oh I'm done, had enough of my way<br>
<br>
With dust on our Bibles<br>
Brand new iPhones<br>
No wonder why we feel this way<br>
We walk with our eyes closed<br>
Blind leading blind folk<br>
And I'm done with those idols and dusty Bibles<br>
<br>
Oh<br>
<br>
I miss the way things used to be back in 2017<br>
And I just miss my friend<br>
Oh I just miss my friend<br>

by Megan Woods.<br>
<br>
<br>
How many times can you hear the same lie<br>
Before you start to believe it?<br>
The enemy keeps whisperin' to me<br>
I swear these days it's all that I'm hearin'<br>
<br>
<br>
I used to know who I was<br>
Now I look in the mirror and I'm not so sure<br>
Lord, I don't wanna listen to the lies<br>
anymore<br>
<br>
<br>
The truth is I am my Father's child<br>
I make Him proud and I make Him smile<br>
I was made in the image of a perfect King<br>
He looks at me and wouldn't change a thing<br>
The truth is I am truly loved<br>
By a God who's good when I'm not good enough<br>
I don't belong to the lies, I belong to You<br>
And that's the truth<br>
<br>
<br>
When I feel like there's so much noise<br>
Livin' rent-free in my head,<br>
Heaven finds me in a still small voice<br>
And it sounds like grace instead<br>
<br>
<br>
You remind me who I am<br>
When I look in the mirror and I'm not so sure<br>
Lord, I don't wanna listen to the lies<br>
anymore<br>
<br>
<br>
The truth is I am my Father's child<br>
I make Him proud and I make Him smile<br>
I was made in the image of a perfect King<br>
He looks at me and wouldn't change a thing<br>
The truth is I am truly loved<br>
By a God who's good when I'm not good enough<br>
I don't belong to the lies, I belong to You<br>
And that's the truth<br>
<br>
<br>
I know who I am<br>
'Cause I know who You are<br>
And I hold Your truth inside of my heart<br>
<br>
I know the lies are always gonna try and find me<br>
But I've never been so sure<br>
<br>
<br>
The truth is I am my Father's child<br>
I make Him proud and I make Him smile<br>
I was made in the image of a perfect King<br>
He looks at me and wouldn't change a thing<br>
The truth is I am truly loved<br>
By a God who's good when I'm not good enough (Not good enough)<br>
I don't belong to the lies, I belong to You (I belong to You)<br>
And that's the truth<br>
<br>
<br>
Hmm<br>

According to Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia,<br>
as of January of 2026,<br>
one of the most popular Christian songs of 2025 was<br>
What An Awesome God,<br>
by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
The original version of this song was from Rich Mullins.<br>
<br>
Rich Mullins was an American contemporary Christian music singer and songwriter,<br>
best known for his worship songs "Awesome God" and "Sometimes by Step".<br>
His work includes 9 studio albums, 6 compilations, and 17 singles, mainly from 1986 to 1997.<br>
He was born in 1955, and he passed away in 1997, at the age of 41.<br>
<br>
Sometimes by Step was also one of the most famous songs by Rich Mullins.<br>
It was released on his 1992 album,<br>
The World as Best as I Remember It, Vol. 2<br>
<br>
In that song, in the main chorus of Sometimes by Step,<br>
Rich Mullins sang this:<br>
<br>
Oh God, You are my God<br>
And I will ever praise You<br>
And I will seek You in the morning<br>
And I will learn to walk in Your ways<br>
And step by step You'll lead me<br>
And I will follow You all of my days<br>
<br>
<br>
But it was his song, Awesome God, that was likely his most famous and most remembered song.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Awesome God" is a contemporary worship song written by Rich Mullins and<br>
first recorded on his 1988 album, his third album, Winds of Heaven, Stuff of Earth.<br>
It was the first single from the album and rose to the number one spot<br>
on Christian AC radio and subsequently became a popular congregational song.<br>
<br>
<br>
From his album, Winds of Heaven, Stuff of Earth,<br>
is the original version of the 1988 song, Awesome God, by Rich Mullins.<br>
<br>
Phil Wickham decided to take that song, and keep the main chorus close to its original version, but create brand new lyrics, and give it a new, fresh sound.<br>
<br>
On 11 April 2025, Phil Wickham released his updated version of the song, titled "What an Awesome God".<br>
It was later released onto his tenth studio album, Song of the Saints, on 12 September 2025.<br>
The song became his first Billboard Hot 100 entry and topped Billboard's Christian Airplay and AC Airplay charts.<br>
<br>
<br>
What was it that made Phil Wickham want to make a new version of the song with new lyrics?<br>
<br>
To find out, we go to Contemporary Christian Music Magazine, better known as CCM Magazine.<br>
Logan Sekulow is the co-editor of CCM Magazine, along with also being a television host and producer, filmmaker, and long-time voice in faith-based media.<br>
He was able to have an Exclusive Interview with Phil Wickham about this song.<br>
His interview was published in CCM Magazine on 11 December 2025, and can be found at this internet address...<br>

<br>
<br>
This CCM Magazine article from Logan Sekulow, is titled,<br>
Why Phil Wickham Reimagined 'Awesome God'  --  Exclusive Interview<br>
<br>
Here are a few selected portions being quoted from that article.<br>
<br>
Logan mentions, "At first glance you may hear a glossy remake with brand new verses and a modernised version of the historic chorus. After talking to Phil about it though, the motivation was clear. What brought him to Awesome God was reverence, memories, and a surprising kind of joy."<br>
<br>
Phil Wickham explains it like this:<br>
Phil Wickham says, "I was in Nashville in my buddy's studio, Jonathan Smith...it was 11, 11:30 at night, and me and a couple guys in the studio were just talking about songs that we loved as kids."<br>
<br>
"So we thought, well, man, what about Awesome God? It'd be great to throw in at the end of a song. And then we started joking around about, like, what if we wrote new verses because we never could sing the verses in the first place?"<br>
<br>
"Someone turned the computer back on, played a beat, I sang a melody, and then 30 minutes later had the song written for What an Awesome God. We just had a fun time, turned it off at 1 a.m., went to bed, woke up the next morning, listened to it, and we all kind of looked at each other thinking like, this kind of hits. Like, this is kind of awesome."<br>
<br>
"I just put it on social media to get a gauge because I don't want to ruin this," Phil said. "I don't want to create a bad situation here, like ruining a song that people love."<br>
<br>
The reaction was instant. "I put it up on social media, and by far, of anything I've ever posted, it got like crazy feedback of people just saying, 'We're so excited. Bring it back. This is something we want to sing again.' And so I just let the audience decide."<br>
<br>
"...I like the old verses too. I'm definitely not trying to replace anything, but more honour a song and bring a chorus into it. It's been so life-giving to bring these choruses into nights again and just remind myself of the first time I met God through these songs."<br>
<br>

I want to pray a prayer where I am really thinking about His name, in English, and in ancient Hebrew.<br>

The name of the Most High ELL-Low-Heem, the name of ELL-ELLE-ON is Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, in English is The Lord of Hosts, also known as the Lord of Spirits in the book of Enoch.<br>
He is the God and Master and Lord of Heaven's Angel Army.<br>
<br>
The Son of God, the Son of ELL-ELLE-ON, the Son of Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, is Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>
In Hebrew, the name of the Son of God, is Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>
In English, this name of the Son of God, is Jesus Christ.<br>
Jesus is the name, and Christ is a title.<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw is the name of the Son of God, and Muh-She-Uck is a title.<br>
This title, Christ, or, Muh-She-Uck -- it means, Messiah. Messiah, Muh-She-Uck, means, Anointed One.<br>
<br>
To anoint someone is to pour oil on them, or to at least apply oil to their head.<br>
When someone was to become a king or high priest, someone would pour oil over their head, anointing them,<br>
to show that special power and authority is being placed upon the one becoming king or high priest.<br>
Jesus is our King AND High Priest, forever.<br>
<br>
The Father sacrificed His only begotten Son, so that whosever believes that Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw is the Son of the Most High ELL-Low-Heem<br>
shall not perish, shall not die, but shall received eternal life and everlasting life.<br>
<br>
If you say out loud, confessing with your mouth, that Jesus is Lord, that Yaw-Who-Shaw is Master,<br>
and you believe in your heart that the Father Yaw-Who-Wah raised up His Son Yaw-Who-Shaw from the grave, you shall be saved.<br>
<br>
I believe that Yaw-Who-Shaw is the Son of Yaw-Who-Wah, and I believe that Yaw-Who-Shaw is Master, King and High Priest, our Anointed One, our Messiah.<br>
I believe that the Father Yaw-Who-Wah raised up His Son Yaw-Who-Shaw from the grave.<br>
<br>
Let us remember again now that we have thankfully received from the Father, through his Son, His gift of Eternal life, Everlasting life, salvation, forgiveness, mercy and grace.<br>
<br>
We believe that Jesus is Salvation. To say that in Hebrew, we would say, we believe that Yaw-Who-Shaw is Yeh-Shoe-Uh.<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw, Yeh-Shoe-Uh is the Son of ELL-ELLE-On Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
Help us obey you, fear you and follow you. Help us stop sinning, now, and forever more. Save us, help us, rescue us, and heal us, strengthen us, encourage us, cleanse us, purify us, perfect us, lead us, guide us, protect us, enter into us, and put into us your love, your joy, your peace, your spirit, your presence and your glory. In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>
