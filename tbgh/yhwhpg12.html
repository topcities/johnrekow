Philippians 4:11 (KJV)<br>
Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 6: verse 6 and 8 (KJV)<br>
6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.<br>
8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 6: verse 6 and 8 -- NLT<br>
6 Yet true godliness with contentment is itself great wealth.<br>
8 So if we have enough food and clothing, let us be content.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 12:9 -- KJV<br>
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:13 -- KJV<br>
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br>
<br>
<br>
My wife's two most favourite Bible verses of all time are these two here...<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 12:9 -- KJV<br>
...My grace is sufficient for thee....<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:13 -- KJV<br>
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:13 & 14 -- KJV<br>
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br>
14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That same selected portion of 2 Corinthians 12:9 in the NLT...<br>
My grace is all you need.<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:11-14 -- NLT<br>
...I have learned how to be content with whatever I have.<br>
12 I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little.<br>
13 For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.<br>
(For I can do everything through the one who gives me strength.)<br>
14 Even so, you have done well to share with me in my present difficulty.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 12: 3-10 -- NLT<br>
<br>
(Yes, only God knows whether I was in my body or outside my body. But I know such a man, that he was caught up to paradise and heard things so astounding that they cannot be expressed in words, things no human is allowed to tell.)<br>
<br>
<br>
3 Yes, only God knows whether I was in my body or outside my body. But I do know<br>
4 that I was caught up to paradise and heard things so astounding that they cannot be expressed in words, things no human is allowed to tell.<br>
5 That experience is worth boasting about, but I'm not going to do it. I will boast only about my weaknesses.<br>
6 If I wanted to boast, I would be no fool in doing so, because I would be telling the truth. But I won't do it, because I don't want anyone to give me credit beyond what they can see in my life or hear in my message,<br>
7 even though I have received such wonderful revelations from God. So to keep me from becoming proud, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud.<br>
8 Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away.<br>
9 Each time he said, "My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness." So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me.<br>
10 That's why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.<br>
<br>
Repeating these two verses one more time...<br>
2 Corinthians 12:9 -- KJV<br>
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:13 -- KJV<br>
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 9:8 (KJV)<br>
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:<br>
<br>

Commentary:<br>
Jonah hates the city of Nineveh, and when the Lord tells him to go there, Jonah boards a ship that is sailing in the opposite direction.<br>
Something interesting happened on the way to Nineveh, whilst trying to travel in the opposite direction, away from Nineveh.<br>
The Lord used Jonah even during the time when he was trying to go the wrong direction on purpose.<br>
Look at the sailors, the mariners.<br>
Look at who their God was before, and then look at who their God was after.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Look at these selected verses in chapter 1, the chapter where<br>
Jonah Runs from the Lord<br>
<br>
Jonah 1: 4 & 5 -- KJV<br>
<br>
(But the Lord cast forth a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship thought to be broken.)<br>
<br>
4 But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.<br>
<br>
5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.<br>
<br>
Jonah 1: 4 & 5 NLT<br>
4 But the Lord hurled a powerful wind over the sea, causing a violent storm that threatened to break the ship apart.<br>
5 Fearing for their lives, the desperate sailors shouted to their gods for help and threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship.<br>
But all this time Jonah was sound asleep down in the hold.<br>
<br>
They woke up Jonah. Jonah told them this...<br>
<br>
Jonah 1: Verse 9 -- KJV<br>
9 And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the Lord (Jehovah), the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jonah 1: Verse 9 -- NLT<br>
9 Jonah answered, "I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the land."<br>
<br>
<br>
Jonah 1: 14-16 -- KJV<br>
14 Wherefore they (the sailors, the mariners) cried unto the Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O Lord, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.<br>
15 So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: (and the sea stood from her raging,) and the sea ceased from her raging.<br>
16 Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord, and made vows.<br>
(Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and sacrifice unto the Lord, and vowed vows.)<br>
<br>
Jonah 1: verse 17 is numbered as chapter 2:1 in the Hebrew text.<br>
<br>
Jonah 1: 14-17 -- NLT<br>
14 Then they (the sailors, the mariners) cried out to the Lord, Jonah's God. "O Lord," they pleaded, "don't make us die for this man's sin. And don't hold us responsible for his death. O Lord, you have sent this storm upon him for your own good reasons."<br>
15 Then the sailors picked Jonah up and threw him into the raging sea, and the storm stopped at once!<br>
16 The sailors were awestruck by the Lord's great power, and they offered him a sacrifice and vowed to serve him.<br>
17 Now the Lord had arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for Fish, has a sound that sounds very much like the English word, dog.<br>
It means, fish.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for Whale, is pronounced, Tan-neen.<br>
Tan-neen was translated into Whale in Genesis 1:21 (KJV)<br>
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
<br>
Tan-neen can be used to mean...<br>
dragon, sea-monster, serpent, venomous snake, whale.<br>
dinosaur, sea or river monster.<br>
It mostly was translated into dragon.<br>
It also was translated as Whale in Job 7:12 and Ezekiel 32:2.<br>
<br>
Let's go back to the book of Jonah.<br>
We will now fast forward in Jonah, past chapter 2<br>
which is mainly Jonah's Prayer --  from inside the fish.<br>
then the Lord ordered the fish to spit Jonah out onto the beach.<br>
Then, Jonah Goes to Nineveh in Chapter 3.<br>
Jonah delivers the Lord's message: "Nineveh will be destroyed!"<br>
The people of Nineveh believed God's message, and began to show their sorrow.<br>
<br>
Let's continue reading in chapter 3, verse 8.<br>
<br>
The ending of the Book of Jonah, chapters 3 & 4<br>
Jonah 3:8 reading all the way to the end of the book of Jonah.<br>
which ends at chapter 4, verse 11.<br>
KJV<br>
<br>
8 ...cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.<br>
9 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?<br>
10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.<br>
1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.<br>
2 And he prayed unto the Lord, and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.<br>
3 Therefore now, O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.<br>
<br>
4 Then said the Lord, (Art thou greatly angry?) Doest thou well to be angry?<br>
<br>
<br>
5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.<br>
<br>
<br>
6 And the Lord God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.<br>
(So Jonah rejoiced with great joy, and was exceeding glad of the Kikajon, or palmcrist.)<br>
<br>
7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.<br>
<br>
8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared (a silent east wind,) a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.<br>
<br>
(And God said to Jonah, Art thou greatly angry? And he said, I am greatly angry, even unto death.)<br>
9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Then said the Lord, Thou hast spared the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which was the son of the night, and perished in a night:)<br>
10 Then said the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:<br>
<br>
<br>
11 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?<br>
<br>
<br>
The ending of the Book of Jonah, chapters 3 & 4<br>
Jonah 3:8 reading all the way to the end of the book of Jonah.<br>
which ends at chapter 4, verse 11.<br>
NLT<br>
8 ...everyone must pray earnestly to God. They must turn from their evil ways and stop all their violence.<br>
9 Who can tell? Perhaps even yet God will change his mind and hold back his fierce anger from destroying us."<br>
10 When God saw what they had done and how they had put a stop to their evil ways, he changed his mind and did not carry out the destruction he had threatened.<br>
1 This change of plans greatly upset Jonah, and he became very angry.<br>
2 So he complained to the Lord about it: "Didn't I say before I left home that you would do this, Lord? That is why I ran away to Tarshish! I knew that you are a merciful and compassionate God, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. You are eager to turn back from destroying people.<br>
3 Just kill me now, Lord! I'd rather be dead than alive if what I predicted will not happen."<br>
4 The Lord replied, "Is it right for you to be angry about this?"<br>
5 Then Jonah went out to the east side of the city and made a shelter to sit under as he waited to see what would happen to the city.<br>
6 And the Lord God arranged for a leafy plant to grow there, and soon it spread its broad leaves over Jonah's head, shading him from the sun. This eased his discomfort, and Jonah was very grateful for the plant.<br>
7 But God also arranged for a worm! The next morning at dawn the worm ate through the stem of the plant so that it withered away.<br>
8 And as the sun grew hot, God arranged for a scorching east wind to blow on Jonah. The sun beat down on his head until he grew faint and wished to die. "Death is certainly better than living like this!" he exclaimed.<br>
9 Then God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry because the plant died?"<br>
"Yes," Jonah retorted, "even angry enough to die!"<br>
10 Then the Lord said, "You feel sorry about the plant, though you did nothing to put it there. It came quickly and died quickly.<br>
<br>
(But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people who don't know their right hand from their left.)<br>
11 But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people living in spiritual darkness, not to mention all the animals. Shouldn't I feel sorry for such a great city?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew, chapter 20: 8-15 -- NLT<br>
8 "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'<br>
9 "The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius.<br>
(A denarius was the usual daily wage of a day labourer.)<br>
10 So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.<br>
11 When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.<br>
12 'These who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'<br>
13 "But he answered one of them, 'I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?<br>
14 Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you.<br>
15 Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?'<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 15: 27-32 -- NLT<br>
27 'Your brother is back,' he was told, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf. We are celebrating because of his safe return.'<br>
28 "The older brother was angry and wouldn't go in. His father came out and begged him,<br>
29 but he replied, 'All these years I've slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to. And in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends.<br>
30 Yet when this son of yours comes back after squandering your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the fattened calf!'<br>
31 "His father said to him, 'Look, dear son, you have always stayed by me, and everything I have is yours.<br>
32 We had to celebrate this happy day. For your brother was dead and has come back to life! He was lost, but now he is found!'"<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
We will now repeat the comments that were given in the Bible Study, titled, The Hired and The Prodigal.<br>
That study was done quite a while ago, back in Christian Essays 6.<br>
In order for the mature Christian to be angry at the new believer, the older Christian has to judge and remember the sins of the new believer, the sins that one did before he or she got saved.<br>
When we get saved, God remembers our sins no more, we are a new creature and a new creation.<br>
The old person that we used to be no longer exists.<br>
We are born again, and all of our sins are forgiven and forgotten.<br>
Remembering the sins of the past, before someone got saved, leads to judging and unforgiveness, and the anger that is seen in all three of these stories.<br>
In all three of these stories, the person who got saved early in life, and the foolish person who eventually repents and gets saved later in life,<br>
both of these types of people both get the same eternal result, which is forgiveness, living forever in heaven, being saved, having eternal life, not ever having to die, and having all of their sins permanently erased, deleted and forgotten.<br>
The Bible tells us to put away all anger and do not judge.<br>
Instead, we are to love each other, forgive each other, and help each other.<br>
Why do we have these three stories in the Bible?<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 6:37 -- KJV<br>
Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:31 & 32 -- KJV<br>
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:<br>
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.<br>
<br>
Mark 11:26<br>
But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 7:9<br>
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.<br>
<br>
In the Old Testament, the story of Jonah said that he was swallowed up by a fish.<br>
We have checked the Hebrew word there and it only means, fish, and not whale.<br>
In the New Testament, however, Jesus mentions Jonah, pronounced as Jonas, and mentions a whale instead of a fish.<br>
Matthew 12:40 KJV -- Whale -- The Greek word used there for Whale, is pronounced, Kah-Paw-Toes.<br>
Kah-Paw-Toes, means,<br>
any sea-monster, huge fish, whale<br>
a huge fish (as gaping for prey)<br>
It can refer to a whale, but it mainly means, huge fish, or sea-monster.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Whomever was on the team for translating the Greek into the KJV English decided to translate the Greek word, Kah-Paw-Toes, into the English word, whale, and apparently did not bother to look at the Old Testament Hebrew word used in Jonah's story.<br>
Jesus is talking about the story of Jonah, but the KJV translator was just doing his job translating Greek into English, and not really thinking about the meaning behind the message.<br>
<br>
The NLT team were at least smart enough to research this out, like we just did here.<br>
Matthew 12:40 NLT used the word, fish.<br>
<br>
<br>
Twice in the book of Matthew, Religious teachers asked Jesus to show them a sign.<br>
Matthew 12<br>
certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees -- demanding -- see a sign from thee<br>
<br>
Matthew 16<br>
Pharisees also with the Sadducees -- desired -- shew them a sign from heaven<br>
<br>
Religious teachers came up to Jesus on two occasions in the book of Matthew, Chapter 12 and Chapter 16, and asked the same question.<br>
They asked the same question two times, and Jesus gives the same answer two times.<br>
His second response is shorter, so let's read his second, shorter answer first.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 16: 1-4 -- KJV<br>
1 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.<br>
2 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.<br>
3 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?<br>
4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 16: 1-4 -- NLT<br>
1 One day the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, demanding that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.<br>
2 He replied, "You know the saying, 'Red sky at night means fair weather tomorrow;<br>
3 red sky in the morning means foul weather all day.' You know how to interpret the weather signs in the sky, but you don't know how to interpret the signs of the times!<br>
4 Only an evil, adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign, but the only sign I will give them is the sign of the prophet Jonah." Then Jesus left them and went away.<br>
<br>
That was in chapter 16.<br>
Now, let's rewind back to chapter 12, and listen to his first answer to the same question, which contains some additional information.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:38-42 (KJV)<br>
38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.<br>
39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:<br>
40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<br>
41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgement with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.<br>
42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgement with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:38-42 -- NLT<br>
38 One day some teachers of religious law and Pharisees came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want you to show us a miraculous sign to prove your authority."<br>
39 But Jesus replied, "Only an evil, adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign; but the only sign I will give them is the sign of the prophet Jonah.<br>
40 For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.<br>
41 "The people of Nineveh will stand up against this generation on judgement day and condemn it, for they repented of their sins at the preaching of Jonah. Now someone greater than Jonah is here -- but you refuse to repent.<br>
42 (The queen of the south,) The queen of Sheba will also stand up against this generation on judgement day and condemn it, for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Now someone greater than Solomon is here -- but you refuse to listen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
This first, longer answer and teaching, that we were just now reading in Matthew 12, is something that Luke also reported on, in Luke 11.<br>
Next, we will go to there, to Luke 11, where this same teaching is mentioned by Luke.<br>
When we read Luke 11, here in just a moment, notice that, when we read verse 35, he talks about a light that can really be darkness.<br>
Think about that. We are going to read that here, next. Consider what that could mean; a light that can really be darkness.<br>
<br>
Have you ever made a video recording of a TV screen or computer monitor, or a sign that is illuminated with LEDs (Light-Emitting Diodes) for light?<br>
Sometimes, in the recording, the screen or light appears as flickering or flashes of light, and not solid, steady light, in the video recording.<br>
The screen is only sending out moments of light, known as frames per second, and the video camera is only recording so many frames per second.<br>
Sometimes, in those many frames per second, the recording captures some moments of light, and sometimes it records those moments of darkness.<br>
Moments of light, mixed with moments of darkness, but the naked eye does not see those moments of darkness mixed in with the moments of light,<br>
because there are so many, many pulses of light per second, in those frames per second, the human eye does not see the darkness secretly mixed into the light.<br>
That is not really pure light. It is not 100% pure, solid and steady light. There is darkness secretly mixed into the man-made, artificial light.<br>
God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. Humans, and even satan himself, also know how to make pretty lights.<br>
<br>
Just because you see a pretty light does not mean that what you are looking at is good.<br>
<br>
How interesting! A fake kind of light that is not really light.<br>
Our eyeballs can only detect a specific range of light frequencies.  There are frequencies of light that our eyeballs cannot see.<br>
The concept is similar to how, mobile phones and police radio communications cannot be received on a regular FM Radio.<br>
There is a kind of light that comes out of TV remote controls.<br>
It is technically light, but it is a range of infrared light frequencies that our eyeballs do not detect.<br>
That's why, when you push buttons on the TV remote in the dark, it is transmitting light, but that light has no benefit in lighting up the darkness.<br>
I can give you a torch, known in the United States as a flashlight, but if I fail to tell you that the batteries in the torch are dead, then your confidence and reliability in that torch is a deception.<br>
Only if you test the torch will you be able to find out if it really will light up the darkness for you, or not.<br>
<br>
Luke's report may also remind you of a similar topic that we looked at here before.<br>
That Bible Study topic was titled, Light and Darkness, which we did back in Christian Essays 5,<br>
also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 5.<br>
So, yes, the Bible does talk about this concept several times, in several places, doing a comparison and contrast of the spiritual warfare, the spiritual aspects and characteristics of good and evil, Light and Darkness.<br>
We were pondering and considering these concepts in that Bible study, titled, Light and Darkness, back then in Christian Essays 5,<br>
and here we are again, thinking about this some more, light and darkness, darkness and light, good and evil, trying to make one look like the other, so that you can't tell which is which.<br>
<br>
It's like wolves, looking like sheep and acting like sheep, so they can get close to the sheep, unnoticed.<br>
<br>
Just because you wear a pretty, white robe and a petty tall, pointy hat, shaped like a fish head, does not mean that you are good and right.<br>
Just because white and right rhyme, does not mean the one wearing white is right.<br>
Beware of someone all dressed in white like that. Beware of his slaves who surround him, all dressed in black all of the time.<br>
Do not worship the fish-god, the half-man, half-fish god, with the hat shaped like a fish or fish head.<br>
If you see that, get away and stay away, and do not believe any of his lies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, let's now read what Luke has to say, as we now read Luke 11: 28-36...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11: 28-36 (KJV)<br>
...blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.<br>
29 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.<br>
30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.<br>
31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgement with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.<br>
32 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgement with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.<br>
33 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.<br>
34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.<br>
35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.<br>
36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many of you may already know that "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.<br>
<br>
Luke 11: 28-36 -- NLT<br>
...blessed are all who hear the word of God and put it into practice."<br>
29 As the crowd pressed in on Jesus, he said, "This evil generation keeps asking me to show them a miraculous sign. But the only sign I will give them is the sign of Jonah.<br>
30 What happened to him was a sign to the people of Nineveh that God had sent him. What happens to the Son of Man will be a sign to these people that he was sent by God.<br>
31 (The queen of the south,) "The queen of Sheba will stand up against this generation on judgement day and condemn it, for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Now someone greater than Solomon is here -- but you refuse to listen.<br>
32 The people of Nineveh will also stand up against this generation on judgement day and condemn it, for they repented of their sins at the preaching of Jonah. Now someone greater than Jonah is here -- but you refuse to repent.<br>
33 "No one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where its light can be seen by all who enter the house.<br>
34 "Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is filled with light. But when it is unhealthy, your body is filled with darkness.<br>
35 Make sure that the light you think you have is not actually darkness.<br>
36 If you are filled with light, with no dark corners, then your whole life will be radiant, as though a floodlight were filling you with light."<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 1:5 (KJV)<br>
This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.<br>
<br>
John 1:1 -- KJV<br>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 1:1 -- NLT<br>
In the beginning the Word already existed.<br>
The Word was with God,<br>
and the Word was God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:105 (KJV)<br>
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 11: 13 & 14 (KJV)<br>
13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.<br>
14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 11: 13 & 14 (NLT)<br>
13 These people are false apostles. They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ.<br>
14 But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.<br>

(...but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to humble thyself to walk with thy God?)<br>
<br>
Micah 6:8 NLT<br>

<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
By meeting these requirements, you are fulfilling the law, the Torah.<br>
But, you have failed to meet all of these requirements all of the time, and so you have failed to fulfil the law.<br>
That's why Jesus came here, so that he can fulfil the law and meet all of these requirements for you, on your behalf.<br>
Now, the requirements have all been met, and the law, the Torah, has been perfectly kept and fulfilled, by Jesus Christ, for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:2 (KJV)<br>
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.<br>
<br>
Matthew 5:17 (KJV) Jesus said,<br>
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br>
<br>
Romans 13:10 (KJV)<br>
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.<br>
<br>
1 John 4:16 (KJV)<br>
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 13:8 (KJV)<br>
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.<br>

<br>
Commentary: The Fruit of the Spirit is something that we are supposed to grow, produce and distribute to others.  We are not fruit inspectors, we are fruit distributors. We are not called to inspect and judge others, we are called to love one another. What kind of fruit are you producing and distributing to others? 
<br>
I should not complain about the toothpick that I see stuck in your eyeball, whilst I still have a telephone pole stuck in my own eyeball.
<br>
The book of John, Chapter 1, tells us that Jesus was the Bible in human form. Jesus was Torah. He knew completely and obeyed perfectly and fulfilled Torah, the Bible, entirely. And yet, knowing all of that, and knowing everything about us, he made the decision to hang out and spend time with alcoholic failures and losers, prostitutes, tax collectors, and other misfits that were despised and rejected by the world. I'd rather be like John the Baptist, staying away from everyone, and hiding in the wilderness, telling everyone to repent, and change direction, for the kingdom of God is at hand, but I need to learn to be more like Jesus.  I might know the Bible better than most people, but with all of that Bible knowledge, I need to not judge, but instead, love one another, forgiving one another, because people know not what they do. I want to and I need to be more like that, and I still need help becoming more and more like that, like Jesus was. Lord Jesus, help me be more like that, more like you, and less of me. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8:4 (KJV)<br>
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 3 & 4 -- NLT<br>
...God declared an end to sin's control over us by giving his Son as a sacrifice for our sins.<br>
4 He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are walking in the flesh, you will produce the Fruit of the Flesh.<br>
If you are walking in the Spirit, you will produce the Fruit of the Spirit.<br>
These two lists are right next to each other, in Galatians 5.<br>
It's always fun to read the list for the Fruit of the Spirit.<br>
But, when was the last time you read the list for the Fruit of the Flesh?<br>
<br>
Fruit of the Spirit<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 22-25 -- KJV<br>
22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,<br>
23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.<br>
24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.<br>
25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 22-25 -- NLT<br>
22 But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<br>
23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!<br>
24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there.<br>
25 Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit's leading in every part of our lives.<br>
26 Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Did you know there is also a Fruit of the Flesh?<br>
<br>
Fruit of the Flesh (a better name for this list would be, the Works of the Flesh.)<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 15-21 -- KJV<br>
15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.<br>
16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.<br>
17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.<br>
18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.<br>
19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,<br>
20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,<br>
21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 7-21 -- NLT<br>
7 You were running the race so well. Who has held you back from following the truth?<br>
8 It certainly isn't God, for he is the one who called you to freedom.<br>
9 This false teaching is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough!<br>
10 I am trusting the Lord to keep you from believing false teachings. God will judge that person, whoever he is, who has been confusing you.<br>
11 (Dear Brothers,) Dear brothers and sisters, if I were still preaching that you must be circumcised -- as some say I do -- why am I still being persecuted? If I were no longer preaching salvation through the cross of Christ, no one would be offended.<br>
12 I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would mutilate themselves.<br>
(I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would castrate themselves.)<br>
(I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would cut themselves off from you.)<br>
(I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would cut themselves off.)<br>
<br>
<br>
13 For you have been called to live in freedom, my brothers and sisters. But don't use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature. Instead, use your freedom to serve one another in love.<br>
14 For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbour as yourself." (quoting from Leviticus 19:18.)<br>
15 But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out! Beware of destroying one another.<br>
16 So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won't be doing what your sinful nature craves.<br>
17 The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions.<br>
18 But when you are directed by the Spirit, you are not under obligation to the law of Moses.<br>
19 When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures,<br>
20 idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarrelling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division,<br>
21 envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember, when you study a Bible verse that's hard to understand, you can always turn it into a prayer, and lift it up and take it up to the Lord in prayer...<br>
Pray that He will help you do and obey it, even if you do not quite understand it.<br>
<br>
Let's do that right now. Let us pray.<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, help us walk according to your will, in the Holy Spirit, producing the fruit of the spirit, and help us stay far away from walking in the sinful nature of the flesh.<br>
May we use these Bible verses like the traffic signs and pavement markings on the road you have us on, so we can clearly discern the difference between staying on the road, and driving off of the road.<br>
May we use these Bible verses like the lines painted on the road that help us see the boundaries of the road in the darkness.<br>
Help us never drive off of the road that you say we should be on, be it by accidental drowsiness and distraction, or even by purposeful rebellion and disobedience. Be our Good Shepard.<br>
Help us consistently and faithfully use our freedom to stay on the right road that you have guided us on, and help us use our freedom to obey your two greatest commandments, loving you, Lord Jesus, and loving others.<br>
Help us do and obey your word and your will.<br>
In Jesus' name, Amen.<br>

<br>
Here is one example of quoting a verse out of context...<br>
<br>
This is a selected part from the book of Job 13:15<br>
<br>
Job 13:15 -- KJV<br>
Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him....<br>
<br>
Job 13:15 -- NLT<br>
15 God might kill me, but I have no other hope.<br>
(God might kill me, but I hope in him.)<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
That might sound great, but take a look at the verses just before and after it.<br>
In fact, look at all of Verse 15, instead of just the part that was selected.<br>
There are good reasons why the book of Job is not always a good place to get cool Bible Verse quotes.<br>
And yet, it is still a very important book in the Bible.<br>
<br>
Let's look at this area of scripture, here in the Book of Job, chapter 13.<br>
We will start at verse 9, and read to verse 22.<br>
Be sure to also look carefully at all of Verse 15.<br>
We quoted part of it, but it has a second part that we should not do, and should not go around quoting.<br>
We should be doing things, His way, not our own way, according to His will, not our own will.<br>
This chapter 13, here in Job, is...<br>
after Job's Fourth Speech, which is A Response to Zophar<br>
here in Chapter 13, Job Wants to Argue His Case with God<br>
and in this area of scripture, Job Asks How He Has Sinned.<br>
Job did not sin.<br>
The Lord was using Job's situation to silence Satan, the accuser.<br>
But, Job did not know this, and he did not know why several bad things had all happened to him in such a short period of time.<br>
Job's so-called friends were trying to comfort him by telling him that he must have done something wrong, but those friends were very mistaken about that, as well as a great many other things.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Job 13: 9-22 -- KJV<br>
9 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?<br>
10 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.<br>
11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?<br>
12 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.<br>
<br>
13 (Be silent from me,) Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.<br>
<br>
14 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?<br>
<br>
15 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.<br>
(but I will prove mine own ways before him.)<br>
(but I will argue mine own ways before him.)<br>
<br>
<br>
16 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.<br>
17 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.<br>
18 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.<br>
19 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.<br>
20 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.<br>
21 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.<br>
22 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Job 13: 9-22 -- NLT<br>
9<br>
What will happen when he finds out what you are doing?<br>
Can you fool him as easily as you fool people?<br>
10<br>
No, you will be in trouble with him<br>
if you secretly slant your testimony in his favour.<br>
11<br>
Doesn't his majesty terrify you?<br>
Doesn't your fear of him overwhelm you?<br>
12<br>
Your platitudes are as valuable as ashes.<br>
Your defence is as fragile as a clay pot.<br>
13<br>
"Be silent now and leave me alone.<br>
Let me speak, and I will face the consequences.<br>
<br>
<br>
14<br>
(Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and take my life in my own hands?)<br>
Why should I put myself in mortal danger<br>
and take my life in my own hands?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
15<br>
(God might kill me, but I hope in him.)<br>
God might kill me, but I have no other hope.<br>
I am going to argue my case with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
16<br>
But this is what will save me -- I am not godless.<br>
If I were, I could not stand before him.<br>
17<br>
"Listen closely to what I am about to say.<br>
Hear me out.<br>
18<br>
I have prepared my case;<br>
I will be proved innocent.<br>
19<br>
Who can argue with me over this?<br>
And if you prove me wrong, I will remain silent and die.<br>
20<br>
"O God, grant me these two things,<br>
and then I will be able to face you.<br>
21<br>
Remove your heavy hand from me,<br>
and don't terrify me with your awesome presence.<br>
22<br>
Now summon me, and I will answer!<br>
Or let me speak to you, and you reply.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Job 23: 9-14 -- KJV<br>
...I cannot see him:<br>
10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.<br>
(But he knoweth the way that is with me: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.)<br>
<br>
11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.<br>
<br>
<br>
12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.<br>
(Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have hid the words of his mouth more than my appointed portion. I have laid up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food, my appointed portion.)<br>
<br>
<br>
13 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.<br>
14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.<br>
<br>
Job 23: 9-14 -- NLT<br>
...he is concealed.<br>
10<br>
"But he knows where I am going.<br>
And when he tests me, I will come out as pure as gold.<br>
11<br>
For I have stayed on God's paths;<br>
I have followed his ways and not turned aside.<br>
12<br>
I have not departed from his commands,<br>
but have treasured his words more than daily food.<br>
13<br>
But once he has made his decision, who can change his mind?<br>
Whatever he wants to do, he does.<br>
14<br>
So he will do to me whatever he has planned.<br>
He controls my destiny.<br>
<br>

Psalms 150:6 -- KJV<br>
6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.<br>
<br>
Psalms 150:6 -- NLT<br>
6 Let everything that breathes sing praises to the Lord!<br>
Praise the Lord!<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 12:13 -- KJV<br>
13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.<br>
(The end of the matter, even all that hath been heard, is, Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 12:13 -- NLT<br>
13 That's the whole story. Here now is my final conclusion: Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone's duty.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some lyrics to an old hymn.<br>
The origin and author is unknown.<br>
It is a Traditional English hymn in the Public Domain.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a beautiful and precious memory of my wife singing this to me...<br>
<br>
He brought me to His banqueting table,<br>
His banner over me is love.<br>
<br>
He brought me to His banqueting table --<br>
His banner over me is love,<br>
His banner over me is love.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord is mine and I am His,<br>
I am my Beloved's and He is mine --<br>
He's fairest of ten thousand to my soul --<br>
He brought me into His banqueting house,<br>
He lifted me up into heavenly places,<br>
He is the vine and we are the branches,<br>
Jesus is the rock of my salvation,<br>
There's one way to peace through the power of the cross,<br>
His banner over me is love.<br>
He brought me to His banqueting table,<br>
His fruit is sweet unto my taste,<br>
I'm my Beloved's and He is mine.<br>
He is the Shepherd and we are the sheep,<br>
He calls us to His Banqueting Table,<br>
He invites us into His banquet table,<br>
He brought me to His banqueting table,<br>
His banner over me is love<br>
His banner over me is love<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Song of Solomon -- Song of Songs 2:4 -- KJV<br>
<br>
(He brought me to the house of wine,)<br>
4 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.<br>
<br>
Song of Solomon -- Song of Songs 2:4 -- NLT<br>
4<br>
He escorts me to the banquet hall;<br>
it's obvious how much he loves me.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
A banner is a standard.<br>
His standard over me was love.<br>
<br>
That Hebrew word that was translated to the English word, Banner -- The Hebrew word there is pronounced, De-Gell (the G makes a Guh sound)<br>
and it is based on a Hebrew word, Daw-Gal, which means,<br>
Flag,<br> 
to flaunt, raise a flag, to be conspicuous.<br>
That's why the NLT said, it's obvious how much he loves me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In the Bible, we see a concept in which, the colour Red represents the old person that we used to be in the past, the imperfect, sinner.<br>
White is the new, forgiven and perfected, glorified person that we will become when we live forever in Heaven. Our journey, basically, is just going from red, to white, where we walk away from the works of the flesh and we begin to show the works of the Spirit. We go from walking in the flesh, to walking in the spirit, going from red, to white.<br>
<br>
We pull out the weeds in the Fruit of the Flesh list, and, instead, we plant and grow the Fruit Of The Spirit.<br>
<br>
We start with red, and then, end up as White.<br>
<br>
We will do a more in-depth and detailed Bible study on doing this, going from red to white concept,<br>
when we eventually do a Bible study, titled, Ruddy.<br>
<br>
This Bible study, titled, Ruddy, is a study that we will do when we eventually get to<br>
Christian Essays 16, which is also known as, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 16.<br>
<br>
For now, here is just one little sample to think about.<br>
We will eventually read again some of these comments and the following verse again in the Ruddy Bible study.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 1:18 -- KJV<br>
18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 1:18 -- NLT<br>
18<br>
"Come now, let's settle this,"<br>
says the Lord.<br>
"Though your sins are like scarlet,<br>
I will make them as white as snow.<br>
Though they are red like crimson,<br>
I will make them as white as wool.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After we did our Bible studies on God's actual Hebrew Name, and, the study called, Roots Before Fruits, we did read all of Isaiah chapter 53 when we were looking around at some random Bible readings, near the end of Christian Essays 8.<br>
<br>
Let's review a little sample of chapter 53.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 53: 4 & 5 -- KJV<br>
4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.<br>
5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.<br>
(But he was tormented for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his bruise we are healed.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 53: 4 & 5 -- NLT<br>
<br>
(Yet it was our sicknesses he carried; it was our diseases that weighed him down.)<br>
<br>
4<br>
Yet it was our weaknesses he carried;<br>
it was our sorrows that weighed him down.<br>
And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God,<br>
a punishment for his own sins!<br>
5<br>
But he was pierced for our rebellion,<br>
crushed for our sins.<br>
He was beaten so we could be whole.<br>
He was whipped so we could be healed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 33: 8 & 9 -- KJV<br>
<br>
8 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.<br>
9 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them....<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 33: 8 & 9 -- NLT<br>
<br>
8 I will cleanse them of their sins against me and forgive all their sins of rebellion.<br>
9 Then this city will bring me joy, glory, and honour before all the nations of the earth! The people of the world will see all the good I do for my people, and they will tremble with awe at the peace and prosperity I provide for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even though this next verse is being quoted out of context, outside of its context, it is, here by itself, still good, encouraging advice for us all...<br>
<br>
Lamentations 3: 40 & 41 -- KJV<br>
40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.<br>
41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.<br>
<br>
Lamentations 3: 40 & 41 -- NLT<br>
...let us test and examine our ways.<br>
Let us turn back to the Lord.<br>
41<br>
Let us lift our hearts and hands<br>
to God in heaven....<br>
<br>
<br>
We read, earlier in Job 23:10<br>
...he knoweth the way that I take... (he knoweth the way that is with me...)<br>
<br>
and we just now read, in Lamentations 3:40<br>
Let us search and try our ways -- let us test and examine our ways<br>
<br>
That reminds me of what Jesus said.<br>
<br>
John 14:6 -- KJV<br>
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>
<br>
John 11:25 -- KJV<br>
Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36: 25-27 -- KJV<br>
25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.<br>
26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.<br>
27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgements, and do them.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36: 25-29 -- NLT<br>
25 "Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship idols.<br>
<br>
26 And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart.<br>
(I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a heart of flesh.)<br>
<br>
<br>
27 And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.<br>
28 "And you will live in Israel, the land I gave your ancestors long ago. You will be my people, and I will be your God.<br>
29 I will cleanse you of your filthy behaviour.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If we take what we just read here, and also remember the Gospel, we have a list...<br>
1. Receive, accept and believe that Jesus is Lord -- Romans 10:9<br>
2. Pray and ask the Lord Jesus to enter into your heart and mind and soul<br>
3. Verse 25 -- He cleans you<br>
4. He remodels you, constructs you, and re-constructs you, doing demolition, remodelling, and new creating and constructing of you from within.<br>
5. Verse 26 -- He gives you a new heart and a new spirit<br>
6. Verse 27 -- He puts His Holy Spirit within you<br>
7. With His Holy Spirit, you can now follow, obey, guard, keep and actually do the Bible, the Torah, the Commandments.<br>
<br>
Again, step 7 is when he gives you the ability to obey and keep his commandments.<br>
You can't do step 7, until he does step 7.<br>
You can't do step 7, until you let him first do steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.<br>
Having trouble doing step 7? Go back and start with step 1, and pray in step 1.<br>
He's the one that does all of these steps, not you.<br>
He does all of this first, then you can observe, guard, keep and obey the Bible, the Torah, the Commandments.<br>
We have the Commandments of the Lord given to Moses in the Old Testament,<br>
and we have the Commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament.<br>
You can do all things through Christ, but without Christ, you can do nothing.<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:13 -- KJV<br>
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br>
<br>
John 15:5 (KJV)<br>
...without me ye can do nothing.<br>
<br>
He is the builder; you are the building.<br>
He is pottery maker, and you are the lump of clay.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 3:20 -- KJV<br>
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When the repairman knocks on the door, let him in so he can get to work and get things fixed.<br>
He's not going to knock if you don't call him, and tell him what needs fixing.<br>
It's not a phone you use to call him, what you use, it's called, prayer.<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:17<br>
Pray without ceasing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 7: 13 & 14 and verse 18 -- KJV<br>
13 ...the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.<br>
14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.<br>
18 ...(the high ones,) the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 7: 13 & 14 and verse 18 -- NLT<br>
13 As my vision continued that night, I saw someone like a Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient One and was led into his presence.<br>
14 He was given authority, honour, and sovereignty over all the nations of the world, so that people of every race and nation and language would obey him. His rule is eternal -- it will never end. His kingdom will never be destroyed.<br>
18 ...in the end, the holy people of the Most High will be given the kingdom, and they will rule forever and ever."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That last verse, verse 18, reminds me of a verse that we have studied<br>
when we were going through the top 500 most popular Bible verses, which we did back in<br>
The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter Zero<br>
at the verse that landed at random Bible verse position number 460.<br>
<br>
Luke 12:32 -- KJV<br>
Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12:32 -- NLT<br>
"So don't be afraid, little flock. For it gives your Father great happiness to give you the Kingdom.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1:4 (NLT)<br>
and we have a priceless inheritance -- an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay.<br>

Amos 5: 13-15 KJV<br>
13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.<br>
14 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the Lord, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.<br>
15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgement in the gate: it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.<br>
<br>
<br>
Amos 5: 13-15 NLT<br>
13<br>
So those who are smart keep their mouths shut,<br>
for it is an evil time.<br>
14<br>
Do what is good and run from evil<br>
so that you may live!<br>
Then the Lord God of Heaven's Armies will be your helper,<br>
just as you have claimed.<br>
15<br>
Hate evil and love what is good;<br>
turn your courts into true halls of justice.<br>
Perhaps even yet the Lord God of Heaven's Armies<br>
will have mercy on the remnant of his people (the remnant of Joseph).<br>

There is one feast where one is supposed to fast on that feast day.<br>
<br>
Feast 6 of 7 is known as The Day of Atonement<br>
Celebrate the Day of Atonement nine days after the Festival of Trumpets.<br>
That would be on the tenth day of the seventh month; This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in September or October.<br>
It is celebrated today as Yom Kippur.<br>
You must observe it as an official day for holy assembly, a day to deny yourselves (a day to fast) and present special gifts to the Lord.<br>
<br>
In the KJV, to fast is, to afflict your souls.<br>
Fasting was translated into, afflict your souls, in the KJV.<br>

<br>
30 On that day (offerings of atonement,) offerings of purification will be made for you, to purify you, and you will be purified in the Lord's presence from all your sins.<br>

28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God.<br>
29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.<br>
30 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.<br>
31 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.<br>
<br>
32 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.<br>

26 Then the Lord said to Moses,<br>
<br>
(on the tenth day of the seventh month; This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in September or October.)<br>
<br>
27 "Be careful to celebrate the Day of Atonement on the tenth day of that same month -- nine days after the Festival of Trumpets. (It is celebrated today as Yom Kippur.) You must observe it as an official day for holy assembly, a day to deny yourselves, a day to fast, and present special gifts to the Lord.)<br>

<br>
28 Do no work during that entire day because it is the Day of Atonement, when offerings of purification are made for you, making you right with the Lord your God.<br>

29 All who do not deny themselves that day will be cut off from God's people.<br>
30 And I will destroy anyone among you who does any work on that day.<br>
31 You must not do any work at all! This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation wherever you live.<br>
32 This will be a Sabbath day of complete rest for you, and on that day you must deny yourselves. This day of rest will begin at sundown on the ninth day of the month and extend until sundown on the tenth day."<br>

Matthew 28: 16-20 KJV<br>
16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.<br>
17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.<br>
18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.<br>
19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br>
20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.<br>
<br>
Matthew 28: 16-20 NLT:<br>
16 Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee, going to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.<br>
17 When they saw him, they worshiped him -- but some of them doubted!<br>
18 Jesus came and told his disciples, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth.<br>
<br>
19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, (make disciples of all peoples,) baptising them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
20 Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
1. Teach all nations -- Gentiles -- Uncircumcised<br>
2. baptising them<br>
3. After that, teach them to obey all the commands<br>
<br>
Teach the Gospel, the Good News, get them Baptised,<br>
then teach them all the commandments.<br>
It especially says to teach them everything that Jesus taught.<br>
<br>
You will have to spend some time in New Testament,<br>
if you are to ever share and teach the New Testament.<br>
<br>
Verse 20 says, in KJV<br>
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I (Jesus) have commanded you....<br>
<br>
The teachings of Jesus were more like the commandments of Jesus.<br>

Romans 1:16-19 KJV<br>
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.<br>
17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.<br>
18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;<br>
19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 1:16-19 NLT<br>
16 For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes -- the Jew first and also the Gentile.<br>
(It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes -- the Jew first and also the Greek.)<br>
<br>
<br>
17 This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, "It is through faith that a righteous person has life."<br>
("The righteous will live by faith." -- Quoting from Habakkuk 2:4.)<br>
<br>
18 But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who suppress the truth by their wickedness.<br>
(But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who, by their wickedness, prevent the truth from being known.)<br>

<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 2:2-4 KJV<br>
2 And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.<br>
3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.<br>
4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 2:2-4 NLT<br>
2<br>
Then the Lord said to me,<br>
"Write my answer plainly on tablets,<br>
so that a runner can carry the correct message to others.<br>
3<br>
This vision is for a future time.<br>
It describes the end, and it will be fulfilled.<br>
If it seems slow in coming, wait patiently,<br>
for it will surely take place.<br>
It will not be delayed.<br>
4<br>
"Look at the proud!<br>
They trust in themselves, and their lives are crooked.<br>
But the righteous will live by their faithfulness to God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Greek version:<br>
If the vision is delayed, wait patiently,<br>
for it will surely come and not delay. <br>
4<br>
I will take no pleasure in anyone who turns away.<br>
But the righteous person will live by my faith.<br>
<br>

21 Since you have heard about Jesus and have learned the truth that comes from him,<br>
22 throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception.<br>
23 Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes.<br>
24 Put on your new nature, created to be like God -- truly righteous and holy.<br>
25 So stop telling lies. Let us tell our neighbours the truth, for we are all parts of the same body.<br>

As for this next verse here, we just read this verse a moment ago in the NLT...<br>

Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2:13-18 NLT<br>
13 But now you have been united with Christ Jesus. Once you were far away from God, but now you have been brought near to him through the blood of Christ.<br>
14 For Christ himself has brought peace to us. He united Jews and Gentiles into one people when, in his own body on the cross, he broke down the wall of hostility that separated us.<br>
15 He did this by ending the system of law with its commandments and regulations. He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself one new people from the two groups.<br>
16 Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of his death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to death.<br>
17 He brought this Good News of peace to you Gentiles who were far away from him, and peace to the Jews who were near.<br>
18 Now all of us can come to the Father through the same Holy Spirit because of what Christ has done for us.<br>
<br>
<br>

Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 5: 16-18 NLT <br>
...At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now!<br>
17 This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!<br>
18 And all of this is a gift from God....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 3:10 (KJV)<br>
And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 3: 10 & 11 (NLT)<br>
10 Put on your new nature, and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him.<br>
<br>
(In this new life, it doesn't matter if you are a Jew or a Greek, circumcised or uncircumcised, a Barbarian, or a Scythian, a slave, or free.)<br>

<br>
Galatians 2:16 KJV<br>
16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.<br>
<br>
Galatians 2:16 NLT<br>
16 Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law."<br>

5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,<br>

2 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.<br>
3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ.<br>
4 Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes.<br>
5 God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure.<br>
6 So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear Son.<br>
(So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out to us in the beloved.)<br>
7 He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins.<br>

7 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel.<br>
8 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord God; this is the day whereof I have spoken.<br>
<br>
9 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:<br>
<br>
(And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the javelins, and the spears, and they shall make a fire of them seven years:)<br>
<br>

9 "Then the people in the towns of Israel will go out and pick up your small and large shields, bows and arrows, javelins and spears, and they will use them for fuel. There will be enough to last them seven years!<br>
10 They won't need to cut wood from the fields or forests, for these weapons will give them all the fuel they need. They will plunder those who planned to plunder them, and they will rob those who planned to rob them, says the Sovereign Lord.<br>

<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:19 NLT<br>
Do not stifle the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Do not stop, suppress, suffocate, kill or almost kill the Holy Spirit, or Holy Ghost.<br>
A spirit can mean, breath or wind. Do not cause the Holy Spirit to be be unable to breathe.<br>
Do not stop the breathing of the Holy Spirit.<br>
Do not prevent the Holy Spirit from continuing his work.<br>
To Quench means to satisfy and Extinguish -- Satisfy a desire, Extinguish a fire, a Holy Fire.<br>
When you are thirsty, and your thirst is quenched, you feel satisfied, and you no longer want to drink water, the living water of the Word.<br>
If someone who is thirsty quenches their thirst, they lose their thirst by having a drink.<br>
Water puts out fire. May we not be so satisfied that we lose interest in the Holy Spirit.<br>
May we always hunger and thirst after righteousness.<br>

Chuck Smith was an American pastor who founded the Calvary Chapel movement.<br>
He was the pastor at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa (CCCM) for 48 years, from 1965 to 2013, in Santa Ana, California (about 34 miles south east of Los Angeles, about 7 miles south of Anaheim).<br>
His final sermon was on Sunday 29 September 2013.<br>
Smith was born on 25 June 1927, and died from lung cancer on Thursday 3 October 2013, at his home in Newport Beach, California, at the age of 86.<br>
After he was buried, a 4-hour public memorial service was held 24 days after his death, on Sunday 27 October 2013, at 5pm, at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California, (about 3 miles east of Disneyland) where more than 200 churches worldwide planned to show his tribute, via a four-hour live webcast.<br>
<br>
Here are a few selected quotes from Pastor Chuck Smith...<br>
<br>
You can't clean the fish before you catch it.<br>
<br>
There's a difference between losing your salvation and leaving your salvation. If you lose something, you don't know where to find it. You can't lose your salvation because you always know where to find it; you can only leave it.<br>
<br>
Ritualism is nothing more than a rut and the only difference between a rut and a grave is the length and the depth.<br>
<br>
What we are really lacking today is a real hatred of evil.<br>
<br>
I think it rather pathetic that so many people are looking forward to heaven to prove that their doctrinal position was correct.<br>

James 3:17 (KJV)<br>
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 3: 13-18 KJV<br>
13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.<br>
14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.<br>
15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.<br>
16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.<br>
17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.<br>
18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.<br>
<br>
James 3: 13-18 NLT<br>
13 If you are wise and understand God's ways, prove it by living an honourable life, doing good works with the humility that comes from wisdom.<br>
14 But if you are bitterly jealous and there is selfish ambition in your heart, don't cover up the truth with boasting and lying.<br>
15 For jealousy and selfishness are not God's kind of wisdom. Such things are earthly, unspiritual, and demonic.<br>
16 For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind.<br>
17 But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and the fruit of good deeds. It shows no favouritism and is always sincere.<br>
18 And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap (a harvest of good things, a harvest of justice,) a harvest of righteousness.<br>

Isaiah 8:10-18 KJV<br>
...Immanuel!...for God is with us.<br>
(For the Lord spake thus to me in strength of hand,)<br>
11 For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,<br>
12 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.<br>
13 Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.<br>
14 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<br>
15 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.<br>
16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.<br>
17 And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.<br>
18 Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 8:10-18 NLT<br>
(Immanuel!) For God is with us!<br>
11 The Lord has given me a strong warning not to think like everyone else does. He said,<br>
12<br>
"Don't call everything a conspiracy, like they do,<br>
and don't live in dread of what frightens them.<br>
13<br>
Make the Lord of Heaven's Armies holy in your life.<br>
He is the one you should fear.<br>
He is the one who should make you tremble.<br>
14<br>
He will keep you safe.<br>
But to Israel and Judah<br>
he will be a stone that makes people stumble,<br>
a rock that makes them fall.<br>
And for the people of Jerusalem<br>
he will be a trap and a snare.<br>
15<br>
Many will stumble and fall,<br>
never to rise again.<br>
They will be snared and captured."<br>
16<br>
Preserve the teaching of God;<br>
entrust his instructions to those who follow me.<br>
17<br>
I will wait for the Lord,<br>
who has turned away from the descendants of Jacob.<br>
I will put my hope in him.<br>
18<br>
I and the children the Lord has given me serve as signs and warnings to Israel from the Lord of Heaven's Armies who dwells in his Temple on Mount Zion.<br>

Isaiah 28:14-18 KJV<br>
14 Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.<br>
15 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:<br>
16 Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.<br>
17 judgement also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.<br>
18 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, (then ye shall be a treading down to it,) then ye shall be trodden down by it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28:14-18 NLT<br>
14<br>
Therefore, listen to this message from the Lord,<br>
you scoffing rulers in Jerusalem.<br>
15<br>
You boast, "We have struck a bargain to cheat death<br>
and have made a deal to dodge the grave.<br>
<br>
(We have struck a bargain to cheat death and have made a deal to dodge Sheol.)<br>
<br>
The coming destruction can never touch us,<br>
for we have built a strong refuge made of lies and deception."<br>
16<br>
Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says:<br>
(Look! I am placing a foundation stone in Zion.)<br>
"Look! I am placing a foundation stone in Jerusalem,<br>
a firm and tested stone.<br>
It is a precious cornerstone that is safe to build on.<br>
Whoever believes need never be shaken.<br>
<br>
Greek version of verse 16:<br>
Look! I am placing a stone in the foundation of Jerusalem, (I am placing a stone in the foundation of Zion,) a precious cornerstone for its foundation, chosen for great honour. Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.<br>
<br>
(The Greek version of this verse is also quoted in Romans 9:33, and 1 Peter 2:6.)<br>
<br>
17<br>
I will test you with the measuring line of justice<br>
and the plumb line of righteousness.<br>
Since your refuge is made of lies,<br>
a hailstorm will knock it down.<br>
Since it is made of deception,<br>
a flood will sweep it away.<br>
18<br>
I will cancel the bargain you made to cheat death,<br>
and I will overturn your deal to dodge the grave.<br>
When the terrible enemy sweeps through,<br>
you will be trampled into the ground.<br>

1 Peter 2: 4-9 KJV<br>
starting in verse 4...<br>
4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,<br>
5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.<br>
6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.<br>
7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,<br>
8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.<br>
9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2: 4-9 NLT<br>
4 You are coming to Christ, who is the living cornerstone of God's temple. He was rejected by people, but he was chosen by God for great honour.<br>
5 And you are living stones that God is building into his spiritual temple. What's more, you are his holy priests, (you are his holy priesthood). Through the mediation of Jesus Christ, you offer spiritual sacrifices that please God.<br>
6<br>
As the Scriptures say,<br>
"I am placing a cornerstone in Jerusalem,<br>
(I am placing a cornerstone in Zion,)<br>
chosen for great honour,<br>
and anyone who trusts in him<br>
will never be disgraced."<br>
<br>
(A quote from the Greek version of Isaiah 28:16.)<br>
<br>
7<br>
Yes, you who trust him recognise the honour God has given him.<br>
(Yes, for you who believe, there is honour.) But for those who reject him,<br>
"The stone that the builders rejected<br>
has now become the cornerstone."<br>
(Quoting from Psalms 118:22)<br>
<br>
8<br>
And, "He is the stone that makes people stumble,<br>
the rock that makes them fall."<br>
(Isaiah 8:14)<br>
They stumble because they do not obey God's word, and so they meet the fate that was planned for them.<br>
9 But you are not like that, for you are a chosen people. You are royal priests, (a royal priesthood,) a holy nation, God's very own possession. As a result, you can show others the goodness of God, for he called you out of the darkness into his wonderful light.<br>

Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 (KJV)<br>
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>
Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 9:30-33 (KJV)<br>
30 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.<br>
31 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.<br>
32 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;<br>
33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 9:30-33 NLT<br>
30 What does all this mean? Even though the Gentiles were not trying to follow God's standards, they were made right with God. And it was by faith that this took place.<br>
31 But the people of Israel, who tried so hard to get right with God by keeping the law, never succeeded.<br>
32 Why not? Because they were trying to get right with God by keeping the law instead of by trusting in him. They stumbled over the great rock in their path.<br>
<br>
(Because they were trying to get right with God by works instead of by trusting in him. They stumbled over the great rock in their path.)<br>
<br>
<br>
33<br>
God warned them of this in the Scriptures when he said,<br>
(I am placing a stone in Zion that makes people stumble, a rock that makes them fall.)<br>
"I am placing a stone in Jerusalem that makes people stumble,<br>
a rock that makes them fall.<br>
But anyone who trusts in him<br>
will never be disgraced."<br>

<br>
Isaiah 64:6 (KJV)<br>
But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 64: 5 & 6 NLT<br>
We are constant sinners;<br>
how can people like us be saved?<br>
6<br>
We are all infected and impure with sin.<br>
When we display our righteous deeds,<br>
they are nothing but filthy rags.<br>
Like autumn leaves, we wither and fall,<br>
and our sins sweep us away like the wind.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Do you know what it means when a woman says that she is, "On the rag?"<br>
Your works, your good deeds, your working attempts of you trying to keep Torah and obey the commandments, they look like filthy rags.<br>
In the eyes of the Lord, you boasting about your good works and your keeping of the law, it looks like a clear plastic bag of filthy rags.<br>
Perhaps, even the kind of filthy material that a woman would throw away during her time of the month.<br>
So, if you should not be boasting about something that has about as much value as a bag of filthy rags, what should you be boasting about instead?<br>
Do you remember Billy Graham's Life Verse, back in Christian Essays 2?<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:14 NLT:<br>
As for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that cross, because of him, my interest in this world has been crucified, and the world's interest in me has also died.<br>

James 1:8 (KJV)<br>
A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1: 5-8 KJV<br>
5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.<br>
6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.<br>
7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.<br>
8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1: 5-8 NLT<br>
5 If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking.<br>
6 But when you ask him, be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind.<br>
7 Such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.<br>
8 Their loyalty is divided between God and the world, and they are unstable in everything they do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 4:8 (KJV)<br>
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.<br>
<br>
James 4:8 NLT<br>
8 Come close to God, and God will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners; purify your hearts, for your loyalty is divided between God and the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 16:13 (KJV)<br>
No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<br>
<br>
Luke 16: 13-15 NLT<br>
13 "No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money."<br>
14 The Pharisees, who dearly loved their money, heard all this and scoffed at him.<br>
15 Then he said to them, "You like to appear righteous in public, but God knows your hearts. What this world honours is detestable in the sight of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3:34<br>
KJV: Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.<br>
NLT: The Lord mocks the mockers but is gracious to the humble.<br>
NLT Greek Version: The Lord opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.<br>
<br>
(The Greek version is also quoted in James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:5.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 4: 6-8 KJV<br>
...God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.<br>
7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 3:18 NLT -- last verse of chapter 3, then we read into chapter 4, to verse 8.<br>
James 4: 1-8 NLT<br>
18 And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap (a harvest of good things, a harvest of justice,) a harvest of righteousness.<br>
1 What is causing the quarrels and fights among you? Don't they come from the evil desires at war within you?<br>
2 You want what you don't have, so you scheme and kill to get it. You are jealous of what others have, but you can't get it, so you fight and wage war to take it away from them. Yet you don't have what you want because you don't ask God for it.<br>
3 And even when you ask, you don't get it because your motives are all wrong -- you want only what will give you pleasure.<br>
4 You adulterers! (You adulteresses!) Don't you realise that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God? I say it again: If you want to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God.<br>
5 Do you think the Scriptures have no meaning? They say that God is passionate that the spirit he has placed within us should be faithful to him.<br>
<br>
(They say that the spirit God has placed within us is filled with envy.)<br>
(They say that the Holy Spirit, whom God has placed within us, opposes our envy.)<br>
<br>
6<br>
And he gives grace generously. As the Scriptures say,<br>
"God opposes the proud<br>
but gives grace to the humble."<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3:34 (Greek version).<br>
<br>
7 So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
8 Come close to God, and God will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners; purify your hearts, for your loyalty is divided between God and the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
In James 1:6, wavering and wavereth are both of the same Greek word, Vee-eh-Kuh-ReeKnow, which means,<br>
<br>
distinguish, discern, doubt, hesitate<br>
separate one from another<br>
separate thoroughly<br>
oppose<br>
discriminate<br>
to get a decision, contend, dispute<br>
to be divided in one's mind, to hesitate, doubt<br>
<br>
<br>
We just read this verse a moment ago.<br>
Think about this verse one more time...<br>
<br>
James 1:6 (KJV)<br>
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:14 (KJV)<br>
That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:12-16 KJV<br>
12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:<br>
13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:<br>
14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;<br>
15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:<br>
16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together....<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:12-16 NLT<br>
...equip God's people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.<br>
13 This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.<br>
14 Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth.<br>
15 Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.<br>
16 He makes the whole body fit together perfectly.<br>

<a name="JAH12FAITHCROWDOWITNEZ"></a><h2>The Hall of Faith</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hall of Faith<br>
The following list of people are a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith.<br>
<br>
The book of Hebrews, chapters 10, 11 and 12.<br>
We will be reading the end of chapter 10, most of chapter 11, and just a little bit of the beginning of chapter 12.<br>
Because it is a long list, we will only read the NLT.<br>
In the book of Hebrews, will we read the following areas of scripture...<br>
Chapter 10, verses 32 to 39,<br>
Chapter 11, verses 1 through 12, and then, at verse 12, we jump down to verse 17, and read verses 17 through 40,<br>
and then, in Chapter 12, we will just read verses 1, 2 and 3.<br>
<br>
(Think back on those early days when you were first enlightened.)<br>
32 Think back on those early days when you first learned about Christ. Remember how you remained faithful even though it meant terrible suffering.<br>
33 Sometimes you were exposed to public ridicule and were beaten, and sometimes you helped others who were suffering the same things.<br>
34 You suffered along with those who were thrown into jail, and when all you owned was taken from you, you accepted it with joy. You knew there were better things waiting for you that will last forever.<br>
35 So do not throw away this confident trust in the Lord. Remember the great reward it brings you!<br>
36 Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God's will. Then you will receive all that he has promised.<br>
37 "For in just a little while, the Coming One will come and not delay.<br>
38 And my righteous ones will live by faith.<br>
(My righteous ones will live by their faithfulness. My righteous one will live by faith.)<br>
But I will take no pleasure in anyone who turns away." (quoting from the book of Habakkuk 2:3-4.)<br>
<br>
39 But we are not like those who turn away from God to their own destruction. We are the faithful ones, whose souls will be saved.<br>
1 Faith shows the reality of what we hope for; it is the evidence of things we cannot see.<br>
2 Through their faith, the people in days of old earned a good reputation.<br>
3 By faith we understand that the entire universe was formed at God's command, that what we now see did not come from anything that can be seen.<br>
4 It was by faith that Abel brought a more acceptable offering to God than Cain did. Abel's offering gave evidence that he was a righteous man, and God showed his approval of his gifts. Although Abel is long dead, he still speaks to us by his example of faith.<br>
<br>
5 It was by faith that Enoch was taken up to heaven without dying -- "he disappeared, because God took him."<br>
(Gen 5:24.)<br>
For before he was taken up, he was known as a person who pleased God.<br>
<br>
<br>
6 And it is impossible to please God without faith. Anyone who wants to come to him must believe that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him.<br>
7 It was by faith that Noah built a large boat to save his family from the flood. He obeyed God, who warned him about things that had never happened before. By his faith Noah condemned the rest of the world, and he received the righteousness that comes by faith.<br>
8 It was by faith that Abraham obeyed when God called him to leave home and go to another land that God would give him as his inheritance. He went without knowing where he was going.<br>
9 And even when he reached the land God promised him, he lived there by faith -- for he was like a foreigner, living in tents. And so did Isaac and Jacob, who inherited the same promise.<br>
10 Abraham was confidently looking forward to a city with eternal foundations, a city designed and built by God.<br>
<br>
11 It was by faith that even Sarah was able to have a child, though she was barren and was too old. She believed that God would keep his promise.<br>
(It was by faith that he, Abraham, was able to have a child, even though Sarah was barren and he was too old. He believed that God would keep his promise.)<br>
<br>
<br>
12 And so a whole nation came from this one man who was as good as dead -- a nation with so many people that, like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore, there is no way to count them.<br>
17 It was by faith that Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God was testing him. Abraham, who had received God's promises, was ready to sacrifice his only son, Isaac,<br>
18 even though God had told him, "Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted." (Gen 21:12.)<br>
<br>
19 Abraham reasoned that if Isaac died, God was able to bring him back to life again. And in a sense, Abraham did receive his son back from the dead.<br>
20 It was by faith that Isaac promised blessings for the future to his sons, Jacob and Esau.<br>
21 It was by faith that Jacob, when he was old and dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons and bowed in worship as he leaned on his staff.<br>
22 It was by faith that Joseph, when he was about to die, said confidently that the people of Israel would leave Egypt. He even commanded them to take his bones with them when they left.<br>
23 It was by faith that Moses' parents hid him for three months when he was born. They saw that God had given them an unusual child, and they were not afraid to disobey the king's command.<br>
24 It was by faith that Moses, when he grew up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.<br>
25 He chose to share the oppression of God's people instead of enjoying the fleeting pleasures of sin.<br>
26 He thought it was better to suffer for the sake of Christ than to own the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his great reward.<br>
27 It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt, not fearing the king's anger. He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible.<br>
28 It was by faith that Moses commanded the people of Israel to keep the Passover and to sprinkle blood on the doorposts so that the angel of death would not kill their firstborn sons.<br>
29 It was by faith that the people of Israel went right through the Red Sea as though they were on dry ground. But when the Egyptians tried to follow, they were all drowned.<br>
30 It was by faith that the people of Israel marched around Jericho for seven days, and the walls came crashing down.<br>
31 It was by faith that Rahab the prostitute was not destroyed with the people in her city who refused to obey God. For she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.<br>
32 How much more do I need to say? It would take too long to recount the stories of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and all the prophets.<br>
33 By faith these people overthrew kingdoms, ruled with justice, and received what God had promised them. They shut the mouths of lions,<br>
34 quenched the flames of fire, and escaped death by the edge of the sword. Their weakness was turned to strength. They became strong in battle and put whole armies to flight.<br>
35 Women received their loved ones back again from death. But others were tortured, refusing to turn from God in order to be set free. They placed their hope in a better life after the resurrection.<br>
36 Some were jeered at, and their backs were cut open with whips. Others were chained in prisons.<br>
<br>
37 Some died by stoning, (some were tested,) some were sawed in half, and others were killed with the sword. Some went about wearing skins of sheep and goats, destitute and oppressed and mistreated.<br>
<br>
<br>
38 They were too good for this world, wandering over deserts and mountains, hiding in caves and holes in the ground.<br>
39 All these people earned a good reputation because of their faith, yet none of them received all that God had promised.<br>
40 For God had something better in mind for us, so that they would not reach perfection without us.<br>
1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith, let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially the sin that so easily trips us up. And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us.<br>
<br>
2 We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus, the champion who initiates and perfects our faith. Because of the joy awaiting him, he endured the cross, disregarding its shame. Now he is seated in the place of honour beside God's throne.<br>
<br>
(Let us run with endurance the race God has set before us. We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus, the originator and perfecter of our faith. Instead of the joy awaiting him, he endured the cross, disregarding its shame. Now he is seated in the place of honour beside God's throne.)<br>
<br>
<br>
(Think of how people hurt themselves by opposing him.)<br>
3 Think of all the hostility he endured from sinful people; then you won't become weary and give up.<br>

James 5: 12-16 KJV<br>
...let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.<br>
13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.<br>
14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:<br>
15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.<br>
16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.<br>
<br>
James 5: 12-16 NLT<br>
Just say a simple yes or no, so that you will not sin and be condemned.<br>
13 Are any of you suffering hardships? You should pray. Are any of you happy? You should sing praises.<br>
14 Are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord.<br>
15 Such a prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will make you well. And if you have committed any sins, you will be forgiven.<br>
16 Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results.<br>

1 Peter 1: 2-9 KJV<br>
2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.<br>
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,<br>
4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,<br>
5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.<br>
6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:<br>
7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:<br>
8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:<br>
9 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1: 2-9 NLT<br>
2 God the Father knew you and chose you long ago, and his Spirit has made you holy. As a result, you have obeyed him and have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ. May God give you more and more grace and peace.<br>
3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is by his great mercy that we have been born again, because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Now we live with great expectation,<br>
4 and we have a priceless inheritance -- an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay.<br>
5 And through your faith, God is protecting you by his power until you receive this salvation, which is ready to be revealed on the last day for all to see.<br>
6 (So you are truly glad.) So be truly glad. There is wonderful joy ahead, even though you must endure many trials for a little while.<br>
7 These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold -- though your faith is far more precious than mere gold. So when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you much praise and glory and honour on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world.<br>
8 You love him even though you have never seen him. Though you do not see him now, you trust him; and you rejoice with a glorious, inexpressible joy.<br>
9 The reward for trusting him will be the salvation of your souls.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2: 20 & 21 KJV<br>
if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.<br>
21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2: 20 & 21 NLT<br>
But if you suffer for doing good and endure it patiently, God is pleased with you.<br>
(For God called you to do good, even if it means suffering, just as Christ died for you.)<br>
21 For God called you to do good, even if it means suffering, just as Christ suffered for you. He is your example, and you must follow in his steps.<br>

1 John 5: 11-13 KJV<br>
11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<br>
12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.<br>
13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 5: 11-13 NLT<br>
11 And this is what God has testified: He has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<br>
12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have God's Son does not have life.<br>
13 I have written this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know you have eternal life.<br>
