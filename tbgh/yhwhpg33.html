Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

In a moment, we will look at a few interesting passages from the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
When we were in Christian Essays 7,<br>
we did a Bible study, titled,<br>
Controlling the Tongue<br>
and in that study, we read<br>
Romans chapter 2, verse 4.<br>
KJV:<br>
4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans chapter 2, verse 4.<br>
NLT:<br>
4 Don't you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?<br>
<br>
<br>
There in verse 4, where the KJV says, the goodness of God,<br>
we looked at that word, goodness, when we were in<br>
Christian Essays 1<br>
when we did the Bible Study, An example of a simple Christian Church Service.<br>
<br>
In that study, we asked this question.<br>
To repent means to change direction. How do we repent?<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (KJV)<br>
...the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.<br>
<br>
Strong's Greek Definition for Goodness comes from the Greek word "chrestos"<br>
which means, kind, easy, better, gracious, fit for use, useful, virtuous, good, benevolent, manageable, mild, pleasant (as opposed to being harsh, hard, sharp or bitter)<br>
<br>
The word, "benevolent" is an interesting word.<br>
<br>
The Chambers 21st Century Dictionary says that benevolent is "showing or involving kindness and generosity... for the benefit of others rather than for profit; charitable."<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (NLT)<br>
...Can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (NIV)<br>
...do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realising that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?<br>
<br>
A form of the word, "benevolent" is something we will see again, here, shortly, in the Eth Cepher, in the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
Back in Christian Essays 13, we had the following Commentary.<br>
Commentary: The seven names of the seven-fold spirit of God are believed to be listed here in Isaiah 11, verse 2.<br>
The spirit of the Lord is the first of the seven spirits listed.<br>
Sevenfold may also be connected with the biblical understanding of the number 7 representing perfection. The "Seven Fold Spirit of God" could be the "perfect" Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 11: 1 & 2 KJV<br>
And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:<br>
<br>
1. And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,<br>
2. the spirit of wisdom<br>
3. and understanding,<br>
4. the spirit of counsel<br>
5. and might,<br>
6. the spirit of knowledge<br>
7. and of the fear of the Lord;<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 11: 1 & 2 NLT<br>
(Out of the stump of the line of Jesse will grow a shoot -- Jesse was King David's father.)<br>
Out of the stump of David's family will grow a shoot --<br>
yes, a new Branch bearing fruit from the old root.<br>
<br>
1. And the Spirit of the Lord will rest on him --<br>
2. the Spirit of wisdom and<br>
3. understanding,<br>
4. the Spirit of counsel and<br>
5. might,<br>
6. the Spirit of knowledge<br>
7. and the fear of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There may be another list of a seven-fold spirit<br>
found in The Book of Enoch.<br>
The English translators are not in agreement on how to number<br>
the chapter numbers and verse numbers.<br>
As a result of this numbering disagreement,<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch chapter 61 verses 8 through 11<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch Chapter 60 verses 10 through 14<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch Chapter 61 verses 10 through 14.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord of spirits and Lord of the spirits, is the Lord of Hosts, and He is<br>
the Master and Lord of Heaven's Angel Armies, known in Hebrew as, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
<br>
The Chosen One, The Elect One is Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck.<br>
The elect ones are the saved believers and followers, the holy set-apart Saints.<br>
The Elect One lives and dwells inside the elect ones.<br>
The light of the world lives and dwells inside the elect ones, making the saved believers and followers the lights of the world.<br>

<br>
THE BOOK OF ENOCH:<br>
TRANSLATED FROM THE ETHIOPIC, WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES.<br>
BY REV. George H. Schodde, PH. D.<br>
PROFESSOR IN CAPITAL UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO.<br>
1882 English Translation.<br>
chapter 61 verses 8 through 11<br>
8. And the Lord of the spirits placed his Chosen One on the throne of his glory, and he will judge all the deeds of the holy ones in heaven, and will weigh their deeds on scales.<br>
9. And when he shall raise his countenance to judge their paths that are secret by the word of the name of the Lord of the spirits, and their path in the way of the just judgement of the highest God, then they will all speak with ONE voice, and bless, and praise, and exalt, and glorify the name of the Lord of the spirits.<br>
10. And then will cry out all the host of the heavens, and all the holy ones above, and the host of God, Cherubim and Seraphim and Ophanim, and all the angels of power, and all the angels of supremacies, and the Chosen One, and the other powers on the earth, above the water, on that day;<br>
11. and will raise ONE voice, and will bless, and glorify, and praise, and exalt, in the spirit of faith [fidelity], and in the spirit of wisdom and of patience, and in the spirit of mercy, and in the spirit of judgement and of peace, and in the spirit of goodness, and will all say with ONE voice;<br>
'Blessed is he, and blessed be the name of the Lord of the spirits, in eternity, and to eternity.'<br>

<br>
The Book of Enoch.<br>
Archbishop Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation<br>
Chapter 60 verses 10 through 14<br>
<br>
10. Then the Lord of spirits seated upon the throne of his glory the Elect One;<br>
11. Who shall judge all the works of the holy, in heaven above, and in a balance shall he weigh their actions. And when he shall lift up his countenance to judge their secret ways in the word of the name of the Lord of spirits, and their progress in the path of the righteous judgement of God most high;<br>
12. They shall all speak with united voice; and bless, glorify, exalt, and praise, in the name of the Lord of spirits.<br>
13. He shall call to every power of the heavens, to all the holy above, and to the power of God. The Cherubim, the Seraphim, and the Ophanin, all the angels of power, and all the angels of the Lords, namely, of the Elect One, and of the other Power, who was upon earth over the water on that day,<br>
14. Shall raise their united voice; shall bless, glorify, praise, and exalt with the spirit of faith, with the spirit of wisdom and patience, with the spirit of mercy, with the spirit of judgement and peace, and with the spirit of benevolence; all shall say with united voice:<br>
Blessed is He; and the name of the Lord of spirits shall be blessed for ever and for ever; all, who sleep not, shall bless it in heaven above.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch Chapter 61 verses 10 through 14.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Spirit of Faith<br>
2. Spirit of Wisdom<br>
3. Spirit of Longsuffering<br>
4. Spirit of Mercy<br>
5. Spirit of Judgement<br>
6. Spirit of Peace<br>
7. Spirit of Benevolence<br>
<br>
What does the word, Benevolence, mean?<br>
Referring again to the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries,<br>
in June 2023, we went to those online Dictionaries to look at, combine and merge together their word definitions<br>
for the word, Benevolence.<br>
According to those online Dictionaries, Benevolence means,<br>
kind and generous<br>
wishing good, the desire to do good; kindness; generosity.<br>
an act of kindness or generosity.<br>
the quality of being kind and helpful:<br>
the quality of being kind, helpful and generous<br>
the act of giving or helping<br>
an act of kindness<br>
inclination or tendency to help or do good to others; charity<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next passage gives us an update about what happened to Wisdom.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has three verses.<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has two verses.<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has two verses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has three verses.<br>
Wisdom did not find a place where she might live, and a dwelling-place was given to her in the heavens.<br>
2. Wisdom came to dwell amongst the children of men, and found no dwelling-place; wisdom returned to her place and took her seat amongst the angels.<br>
3. And injustice came forth from its repository; whom it did not seek, them it found, and dwelt with them, like the rain in the desert, and like dew in the thirsty land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has two verses.<br>
1. Wisdom found not a place on earth where she could inhabit; her dwelling therefore is in heaven.<br>
2. Wisdom went forth to dwell amongst the sons of men, but she obtained not an habitation. Wisdom returned to her place, and seated herself in the midst of the angels. But iniquity went forth after her return, who unwillingly found an habitation, and resided amongst them, as rain in the desert, and as a dew in a thirsty land.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Jeremiah 17: 5 & 6 (KJV)<br>
17:5	Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.<br>
17:6	For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17: 5 & 6 -- NLT<br>
5<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Cursed are those who put their trust in mere humans,<br>
who rely on human strength<br>
and turn their hearts away from the Lord.<br>
6<br>
They are like stunted shrubs in the desert,<br>
with no hope for the future.<br>
They will live in the barren wilderness,<br>
in an uninhabited salty land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:43 (KJV)<br>
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12: 43-45 (NLT)<br>
43 "When an evil (unclean) spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none.<br>
44 Then it says, 'I will return to the person I came from.' So it returns and finds its former home empty, swept, and in order.<br>
45 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before. That will be the experience of this evil generation."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11:24 (KJV)<br>
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.<br>
<br>
Luke 11: 24-26 (NLT)<br>
24 "When an evil (unclean) spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, searching for rest. But when it finds none, it says, 'I will return to the person I came from.'<br>
25 So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order.<br>
26 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next passage talks about a desert, called, Dudel.<br>
Could this desert be the location of the "dry places" where devils and demons go,<br>
when they are rebuked and cast out, and are gone out of a man?<br>
We will find out here, in just a moment. The answer is found...<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 4 through 6<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 6 through 9<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 6 through 9.<br>
<br>
But before we go there, take a look at this...<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
Enoch Chapter 8, verse 1 and 2<br>
1. And Azazel taught mankind to make swords and knives and shields and coats of mail, and taught them to see what was behind them, and their works of art: bracelets and ornaments, and the use of rouge, and the beautifying of the eye-brows, and the dearest and choicest stones and all colouring substances and the metals of the earth.<br>
2. And there was great wickedness and much fornication, and they sinned, and all their ways were corrupt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Different translations spell Azazel's name differently.<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
Enoch Chapter 8, verse 1 and 2<br>
1. Moreover Azazyel taught men to make swords, knives, shields, breastplates, the fabrication of mirrors.<br>
(the fabrication of mirrors was so that it made them see that which was behind them.)<br>
2. Impiety increased; fornication multiplied; and they transgressed and corrupted all their ways, and the workmanship of bracelets and ornaments, the use of paint, the beautifying of the eyebrows, the use of stones of every valuable and select kind, and of all sorts of dyes, so that the world became altered.<br>
<br>
<br>
This one, Azazel, that taught all of this, we will read what happened to him here, next.<br>
He gets sent to a dry place, a desert.<br>
As for this Evil Knowledge he taught,<br>
He had other associates that also taught additional things.<br>
His associates, and what they taught, are also mentioned there in Enoch Chapter 8.<br>
If you want to look at a longer list of this Evil Knowledge that was taught...<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 69<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 68<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 69.<br>
<br>
We have a quickly-made list of that Evil Knowledge<br>
and you can see the compiled list<br>
in the Bible study, titled, Evil Knowledge<br>
which is at the end of Christian Essays 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
Different translations spell his name differently.<br>
<br>
What happened to this one, Azazel, that taught this Evil Knowledge?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 4 through 6<br>
4. And again the Lord spoke to Rufael: "Bind Azazel hand and foot, and put him in the darkness; make an opening in the desert, which is in Dudael, and put him there.<br>
5. And lay upon him rough and pointed rocks, and cover him with darkness that he may remain there forever, and cover his face that he may not see the light!<br>
6. And on the great day of judgement he will be cast into the fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 6 through 9<br>
6. Again the Lord said to Raphael, Bind Azazyel hand and foot; cast him into darkness; and opening the desert which is in Dudael, cast him in there.<br>
7. Throw upon him hurled and pointed stones, covering him with darkness;<br>
8. There shall he remain for ever; cover his face, that he may not see the light.<br>
9. And in the great day of judgement let him be cast into the fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next passage seems to describe the mansions or dwelling places<br>
that we will call home when we get to heaven.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord of spirits and Lord of the spirits, is the Lord of Hosts, and He is<br>
the Master and Lord of Heaven's Angel Armies, known in Hebrew as, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
<br>
The Elect One is Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck.<br>
The elect ones are the saved believers and followers, the holy set-apart Saints,<br>
also known as the just ones, the holy and the elect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
4. And here I saw another vision, the dwellings of the just and the resting-places of the holy.<br>
5. Here my eyes saw their dwellings with the angels, and their resting-places with the holy, and they asked and petitioned and prayed in behalf of the children of men, and justice like water flowed before them, and mercy like dew on the earth; thus it is amongst them to all eternity.<br>
6. And in those days my eyes saw the place of the chosen of justice and of faith [fidelity], and how justice will be in their days, and the just and chosen without number before him to all eternity.<br>
7. And I saw their dwelling under the wings of the Lord of the spirits; and all the just and chosen before him are ornamented as with the light of fire, and their mouths are full of blessings, and their lips praise the name of the Lord of the spirits, and justice before him will not cease.<br>
8. Here I desired to dwell, and my soul longed for this place; here my portion has been before, for such is established concerning me before the Lord of the spirits.<br>
9. And in those days I blessed and exalted the name of the Lord of the spirits with blessings and praise, for he has strengthened me in blessing and praise according to the will of the Lord of the spirits.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
4. There I saw another vision; I saw the habitations and couches of the saints. There my eyes beheld their habitations with the angels, and their couches with the holy ones. They were entreating, supplicating, and praying for the sons of men; whilst righteousness like water flowed before them, and mercy like dew was scattered over the earth.<br>
And thus shall it be with them for ever and for ever.<br>
5. At that time my eyes beheld the dwelling (place)<br>
6. Countless shall be the number of the holy and the elect, (in his presence)<br>
in the presence of God of the elect, of truth, faith, and righteousness.<br>
<br>
7. Their residence I beheld under the wings of the Lord of spirits.<br>
All the holy and the elect sung before him, in appearance like a blaze of fire; their mouths being full of blessings, and their lips glorifying the name of the Lord of spirits. And righteousness incessantly dwelt before him, for ever and for ever.<br>
8. There was I desirous of remaining, and my soul longed for that habitation.<br>
There was my antecedent inheritance; for thus had I prevailed before the Lord of spirits.<br>
(There was my portion before; for thus had it been prevailed respecting me.)<br>
<br>
9. At that time I glorified and extolled the name of the Lord of spirits with blessing and with praise; for he has established it with blessing and with praise, according to his own good pleasure.<br>
(according to the will of the Lord of spirits.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And we see Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck,<br>
assigning our mansions, or dwelling places, to us in this next passage...<br>

3. On that day the chosen One will sit upon the throne of glory, and will choose amongst their deeds [men's deeds] and places without number, and their spirit will become strong in them when they see my Chosen One and those who have called upon my holy and glorious name.<br>
4. And on that day I will cause my Chosen One to dwell amongst them, and will transform heaven and make it a blessing and a light eternally.<br>
5. And I will transform the earth and make it a blessing, and will cause my chosen ones to dwell thereon; and those who have committed sins and crimes will not step on it.<br>
6. For I have seen and satisfied with peace my just ones, and have placed them before me; but for the sinners there awaits before me a judgement, that I may destroy them from the face of the earth.<br>

My righteous ones will I satisfy with peace, placing them before me; but the condemnation of sinners shall draw near, that I may destroy them from the face of the earth.<br>

<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>

<br>
<br>
To lament is to express sadness, regret, annoyance or disappointment about something you think is unsatisfactory or unfair.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 10 through 13<br>
10. And thus also is one such apartment made for the sinners when they die, and are buried in the earth, without a judgement having been passed upon them during their lives.<br>
11. Here their souls are separated in this great affliction until the great day of judgement and punishment and affliction upon the revilers to eternity, and the vengeance for their souls, and here he binds them to eternity.<br>
12. And if it was before eternity, then this apartment has been made for the souls of those who lament and those who reveal their destruction when they were killed in the days of the sinners.<br>
13. And thus it has been created for the souls of men who were not just, but sinners, who were complete in their crimes; and they will be with criminals like themselves; but their souls will not be killed on the day of judgement and will not be taken from here."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 11 through 13<br>
11. And in the same way likewise are sinners separated when they die, and are buried in the earth; judgement not overtaking them in their lifetime.<br>
12. Here their souls are separated. Moreover, abundant is their suffering until the time of the great judgement, the castigation, (the chastisement, the criticism, the severe punishment) and the torment of those who eternally execrate, (who eternally curse and express strong disapproval or hatred,) whose souls are punished and bound there for ever.<br>
13. And thus has it been front the beginning of the world. (And thus has it been from the beginning of the world.) Thus has there existed a separation between the souls of those who utter complaints, and of those who watch for their destruction, to slaughter them in the day of sinners.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: As we now finish this look at these selected passages from the Book of Enoch, here is one final thought to ponder.<br>
In that last verse, we see...<br>
the souls of those who utter complaints,<br>
and of those who watch for their destruction.<br>
Those who watch for their destruction?<br>
Think about that. We are told to to be sober and watch.<br>
Being a sober watchman is one thing, but maybe, this verse may suggest that being extra worried and fearful of coming destruction can develop into a form of sin.<br>
The Bible does promise that, the fearful shall go into the lake which burneth with fire.<br>
Let us be a vigilant, sober watchmen, without becoming fearful of coming destruction, and may we not have a certain fearful looking for of judgement.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:6 (KJV)<br>
Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 4:7 (KJV)<br>
But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5:8 (KJV)<br>
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:8 (KJV)<br>
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:8 -- NLT<br>
"But cowards, unbelievers, the corrupt, murderers, the immoral, those who practice witchcraft, idol worshipers, and all liars -- their fate is in the fiery lake of burning sulphur. This is the second death."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10: 26-29 (KJV)<br>
10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,<br>
10:27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgement and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.<br>
10:28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:<br>
10:29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10: 26-29 -- NLT<br>
26 Dear friends, if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice that will cover these sins.<br>
27 There is only the terrible expectation of God's judgement and the raging fire that will consume his enemies.<br>
28 For anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.<br>
29 Just think how much worse the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God, and have treated the blood of the covenant, which made us holy, as if it were common and unholy, and have insulted and disdained the Holy Spirit who brings God's mercy to us.<br>

<br>
They Love His Holy Name<br>
<br>
The End of the Book of Enoch is a very interesting area to study.<br>
This is Enoch's last chance to tell the people what he has seen just before is ascends up into heaven.<br>
Jasher Chapter 3 tells us that a fiery, horse-like creature is pacing back and forth up in the sky, waiting for Enoch to finish up his message before transporting him to heaven.<br>
Let's read these last few verses of The End of the Book of Enoch here next.<br>
As you carefully study this, you will see how he sees a hell-like place where sinners go,<br>
and he sees the kingdom of Heaven, where the Saints, the Elect Ones, the holy, set-apart believers, are going.<br>
He looks back and forth, between these two eternal destinations.<br>
Notice carefully how he describes the Saints, the Elect Ones, the holy, set-apart believers.<br>
He describes the how their life has been, and all of the bad things that happened to them, just before they go to heaven.<br>
The believers realise how short and temporary their earthly life is, and the many bad ways how the world has treated them.<br>
They love and prefer the eternal life that is to come more than their temporary life in this physical world.<br>
In spite of all the abuse, they remain clean and pure, and they love His Holy Name, as He leads them home and gives them rest.<br>
You will see all of this and so much more, just in these last few verses of the Book of Enoch. Check it out...<br>

5. And I asked one of the holy angels who were with me, and said to him; "What is this shining thing? for it is not a heaven, but only the flame of a burning fire, and the voice of shouting and crying and lamenting and of great pain."<br>
6. And he said to me: "This place which thou seest -- here are brought the souls of the sinners and of the revilers and of those who do evil and change everything that God speaks through the mouth of the prophets concerning things to take place.<br>
7. For some of these have been written down, and noted above in heaven, that the angels may read and know what will happen to the sinners and to the spirits of the humble who have chastised their bodies, and for that receive their reward from God, and of those who are reviled by wicked men;<br>
8. who loved God, and did not love gold or silver or all the riches of the world, but gave over their bodies to torture;<br>
9. and who, since they existed, did not long for terrestrial food, but considered themselves a breath that passes away, and lived accordingly, and were often tried by God, and their spirits were found in cleanness to praise his name.<br>
10. All the blessings they received I have marked down in the books; and he has destined for them their wages, because they have been shown as those who loved the everlasting heaven more than their life, and whilst they were trodden down by wicked men, and heard abuse and reviling from them, praised me."<br>
11. And now I will call to the spirits of the good, from the generation of light, and change those who were born in darkness, who have not been rewarded in their bodies with honour, as was meet for their fidelity.<br>
12. And I will lead out in a shining light those who love my holy name, and will set each one on the throne of honour, of his honour.<br>
13. And they will glitter in times without number, for justice is the judgement of God, for he will give fidelity to the faithful in the dwellings of the paths of rectitude.<br>
14. And they will see how those who were born in darkness will be cast into darkness, whilst the just will glitter.<br>
15. And the sinners will cry, and see them as they shine; and they will go there where days and times are written for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in the End of the Book of Enoch 105: 23-27<br>
23. He (one of the holy angels) said, There, into that place which thou beholdest, shall be thrust the spirits of sinners and blasphemers; of those who shall do evil, and who shall pervert all which God has spoken by the mouth of the prophets; all which they ought to do.<br>
For respecting these things there shall be writings and impressions above in heaven, that the angels may read them and know what shall happen both to sinners and to the spirits of the humble; to those who have suffered in their bodies, but have been rewarded by God; who have been injuriously treated by wicked men; who have loved God; who have been attached neither to gold nor silver, nor to any good thing in the world, but have given their bodies to torment;<br>
<br>
(To those who from the time they were have not been covetous of earthly riches;)<br>
24. To those who from the period of their birth have not been covetous of earthly riches; but have regarded themselves as a breath passing away.<br>
<br>
(And this have they kept)<br>
25. Such has been their conduct; and much has the Lord tried them; and their spirits have been found pure, that they might bless his name.<br>
All their blessings have I related in a book; and He has rewarded them; for they have been found to love heaven with an everlasting aspiration. God has said, Whilst they have been trodden down by wicked men, they have heard from them revilings and blasphemies; and have been ignominiously treated, whilst they were blessing me. And now will I call the spirits of the good from the generation of light, and will change those who have been born in darkness; who have not in their bodies been recompensed with glory, as their faith may have merited.<br>
26. I will bring them into the splendid light of those who love my holy name: and I will place each of them on a throne of glory, of glory peculiarly his own, and they shall be at rest during unnumbered periods. Righteous is the judgement of God;<br>
<br>
(For to the faithful shall he give faith in the habitations of upright ways.)<br>
27. For to the faithful shall he give faith in the habitations of uprightness. They shall see those, who having been born in darkness unto darkness shall be cast; whilst the righteous shall be at rest. Sinners shall cry out, beholding them, whilst they exist in splendour and proceed forwards to the days and periods prescribed to them.<br>
(they exist in splendour and proceed forwards to the days and periods written down for them.)<br>

Commentary:<br>
As we now finish this Bible study,<br>
there is one final thing to mention.<br>
<br>
Here in this Bible study<br>
we looked at the End of the Book of Enoch, in<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation, and<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation.<br>
<br>
When we get to<br>
Christian Essays 35,<br>
also known as, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 35,<br>
at a random moment, almost half of the way into that chapter,<br>
we will look at the End of the Book of Enoch once again,<br>

<br>
The Torah Before Torah<br>
<br>
When we did the Bible study, titled, The Hired and The Prodigal,<br>
which was back in Christian Essays 6,<br>
we had mentioned this little bit of passage from Genesis 19.<br>
<br>
Genesis 19: 5-7 -- KJV<br>
19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.<br>
19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,<br>
19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 19: 5-7 -- NLT<br>
5 They shouted to Lot, "Where are the men who came to spend the night with you? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them!"<br>
6 So Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him.<br>
7 "Please, my brothers," he begged, "don't do such a wicked thing.<br>
<br>
Lot is saying, "don't do such a wicked thing."<br>
Moses had not yet been born, and the Torah, the commandments in the Bible,<br>
had not yet been given out. How did Lot know that it was a wicked thing?<br>
Was there some kind of set of laws, some set of instructions and commandments, some kind of Torah before there was a Torah?<br>
Yes. Was it written down? Maybe, or it was at least taught orally, from generation to generation, until Moses wrote it all down again.<br>
One indication that there was a Torah before there offically was a writen-down Torah, is found in The Book of Jasher.<br>
Can you guess who it was that originally presented this first version of a Torah?<br>
Let's find out!<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of Jasher is not in the Bible anymore.<br>
This English translation is from a Hebrew book printed in 1613.<br>
The paper version was printed and published in Salt Lake City,<br>
by J.H. Parry and Company, in the year 1887.<br>
<br>
The Book of Jasher can be read for free at the following web address, which takes us to the Internet Sacred Text Archive website...<br>

<br>
<br>
Jasher 3: 24-26<br>
24 When at that time Enoch heard this he went and assembled all the inhabitants of the earth, and taught them wisdom and knowledge and gave them divine instructions, and he said to them, I have been required to ascend into heaven, I therefore do not know the day of my going.<br>
25 And now therefore I will teach you wisdom and knowledge and will give you instruction before I leave you, how to act upon earth whereby you may live; and he did so.<br>
26 And he taught them wisdom and knowledge, and gave them instruction, and he reproved them, and he placed before them statutes and judgements to do upon earth, and he made peace amongst them, and he taught them everlasting life, and dwelt with them some time teaching them all these things.<br>

<br>
<br>
The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015)<br>
is an English translation that kept the Hebrew word, "Torah" in their translation.<br>
Here is a very short, incomplete, and very tiny sample of just a few places in the TS2009,<br>
in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament,<br>
where we can appreciate and respect the Torah.<br>
The Hebrew name for God, is Elohim, and it is pronounced, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
(The Eth Cepher spells that same word with a Y instead of a letter I.)<br>
<br>
(John) 1:1 (TS2009)<br>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Elohim, and the Word was Elohim.<br>
<br>
(Romans) 3:31 (TS2009)<br>
Do we then nullify the Torah through the belief? Let it not be! On the contrary, we establish the Torah.<br>
<br>
(Romans) 7:1 (TS2009)<br>
Or do you not know, brothers -- for I speak to those knowing the Torah -- that the Torah rules over a man as long as he lives?<br>
<br>
(Romans) 2:13 (TS2009)<br>
For not the hearers of the Torah are righteous in the sight of Elohim, but the doers of the Torah shall be declared right.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:18 (TS2009)<br>
Open my eyes, that I might see Wonders from Your Torah.<br>
<br>

Your righteousness is righteousness forever, And Your Torah is truth.<br>

I have hated falsehood and loathe it, Your Torah I have loved.<br>

(The Pharisees said,) "But this crowd that does not know the Torah is accursed."<br>
<br>
(Galatians) 6:2 (TS2009)<br>
Bear one another's burdens, and so complete the Torah of Messiah.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:29 (TS2009)<br>
Remove from me the way of falsehood, And favour me with Your Torah.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:51 (TS2009)<br>
The proud have utterly scorned me, I did not turn aside from Your Torah.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 94:12 (TS2009)<br>
Blessed is the man You discipline, O Yah, And instruct out of Your Torah,<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 37:31 (TS2009)<br>
The Torah of his Elohim is in his heart; His steps do not slide.<br>
<br>
(Romans) 10:4 (TS2009)<br>
For Messiah is the goal of the 'Torah unto righteousness' to everyone who believes.<br>
<br>
(James) 1:25 (TS2009)<br>
But he that looked into the perfect Torah, that of freedom, and continues in it, not becoming a hearer that forgets, but a doer of work, this one shall be blessed in his doing of the Torah.<br>

(Psalms) 119:34 (TS2009)<br>
Make me understand, that I might observe Your Torah, And guard it with all my heart.<br>

Great peace have those loving Your Torah, And for them there is no stumbling-block.<br>
<br>
(Proverbs) 28:9 (TS2009)<br>
He who turns away his ear from hearing the Torah, Even his prayer is an abomination.<br>
<br>
(Galatians) 3:12 (TS2009)<br>
And the Torah is not of belief, but (as mentioned in Leviticus 18:5) "The man who does them shall live by them."<br>
<br>
(Titus) 3:9 (TS2009)<br>
But keep away from foolish questions, and genealogies, and strife and quarrels about the Torah, for they are unprofitable and useless.<br>

Worthy<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If He is wanting us to do things for Him, are we worthy enough to accept the task and perform it to completion successfully?<br>
Are we worthy of being His, and belonging to Him?<br>
Are we living in such a way as to be counted worthy?<br>
Are we walking a worthy walk?<br>
Are we living a worthy life?<br>
Are our hearts worthy?<br>
It might be worthy of your time to study these Bible verses that talk about being worthy.<br>
And then, we will conclude by looking at the one who truly is worthy, in the Book of Revelation.<br>

Matthew 10: 37-42 -- NLT<br>
37 "If you love your father or mother more than you love me, you are not worthy of being mine; or if you love your son or daughter more than me, you are not worthy of being mine.<br>
38 If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, you are not worthy of being mine.<br>
39 If you cling to your life, you will lose it; but if you give up your life for me, you will find it.<br>
40 "Anyone who receives you receives me, and anyone who receives me receives the Father who sent me.<br>
(If you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet, you will be given the same reward as a prophet.)<br>
41 If you receive a prophet as one who speaks for God, you will be given the same reward as a prophet. And if you receive righteous people because of their righteousness, you will be given a reward like theirs.<br>
42 And if you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers, you will surely be rewarded."<br>

Revelation 5: 6-12 (KJV)<br>
5:6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<br>
5:7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.<br>
5:8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps,<br>
(and golden vials full of incense, which are the prayers of saints)<br>
and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.<br>
5:9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;<br>
5:10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.<br>
5:11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;<br>
5:12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 5: 6-12 (NLT)<br>
6 Then I saw a Lamb that looked as if it had been slaughtered, but it was now standing between the throne and the four living beings and amongst the twenty-four elders.<br>
(He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God that is sent out into every part of the earth.)<br>
He had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the sevenfold Spirit of God that is sent out into every part of the earth.<br>
7 He stepped forward and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.<br>
8 And when he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp, and they held gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of God's people.<br>
9<br>
And they sang a new song with these words:<br>
"You are worthy to take the scroll<br>
and break its seals and open it.<br>
For you were slaughtered, and your blood has ransomed people for God<br>
from every tribe and language and people and nation.<br>
10<br>
And you have caused them to become<br>
a Kingdom of priests for our God.<br>
And they will reign on the earth."<br>
(And they are reigning on the earth.")<br>
11<br>
Then I looked again, and I heard the voices of thousands and millions of angels around the throne and of the living beings and the elders.<br>
12<br>
And they sang in a mighty chorus:<br>
"Worthy is the Lamb who was slaughtered --<br>
to receive power and riches<br>
and wisdom and strength<br>
and honour and glory and blessing."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

7 And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him sitting on the throne.<br>
8 And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the set-apart ones.<br>
9 And they sang a renewed song, saying, "You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals, because You were slain, and have redeemed us to Elohim by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,<br>
10 and made us sovereigns and priests to our Elohim, and we shall reign upon the earth."<br>
11 And I looked, and I heard the voice of many messengers around the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders. And the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,<br>
12 saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb having been slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and respect and esteem and blessing!"<br>

About 297 miles east of Miami, Florida, are thousands of islands known as, The Bahamas.<br>
And from The Bahamas main island, 36 miles east of there, is a little island,<br>
known as Nassau.<br>
Nassau is the capital and largest city of the islands of The Bahamas surrounding the area.<br>
On this little island, Nassau,<br>
is a Christian church, called, Chapel On The Hill.<br>
A man there, that is serving as an Elder and Youth Director is also the person that manages the Media and Technology for this church, and his name is Moses Pierre-Paul.<br>
He is also the author of an e-book, titled, Input/Output: Change Your Environment, Change Your Life.<br>
and it has been said that this book is a Great testimony of an overcomer.<br>
Moses Pierre-Paul is also the founder of the website, TheWiseBeliever.com.<br>
On his website, he published an article back on the 17th August 2022.<br>
The article is titled, Three Bible Stories of Impatience and Lessons Learnt<br>
<br>
In August of 2023, this article could be found at this Internet address...<br>
<a href="https://thewisebeliever.com/bible-stories-of-impatience-lessons/">https://thewisebeliever.com/bible-stories-of-impatience-lessons/</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Let's begin by reading some selected quotations from this article by Moses Pierre-Paul.<br>
<br>
<br>
Abraham and Sarah are generally a model couple, but their impatience, when it came to having a child, shows us how rushing a process can lead to stress.<br>
<br>
Although God had blessed Abraham and promised to make him a great nation, all that seemed insignificant to Abraham in light of him not having any children.<br>
<br>
As they got older, it seemed more unlikely that they would have a child of their own. So in their impatience, they concluded that it was probably through another woman that they would have the promised child. As a result, Abraham slept with Sarah's servant Hagar.<br>
<br>
Hagar conceived, but when the child was born, it was the start of stress for both Abraham and Sarah. Hagar began to despise Sarah and in turn, Sarah began to cast blame on Abraham for her misery.<br>
<br>
In time, Abraham did have a child through Sarah as God intended, but since they were impatient, they had brought on themselves stress on the path to getting there.<br>
<br>
Although God chose the Israelites to be a blessing to other nations, they had much to work on as individuals. One of those things was patience. In one particular story, their impatience caused them to do something so bad in the sight of God that it made God want to destroy them.<br>
<br>
In the eyes of the Israelites, Moses was taking too long to come down from the mountain and so they told Moses' assistant Aaron:<br>
<br>
"Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."<br>
(Exodus 32:1 NIV)<br>
<br>
<br>
Sensing their impatience, Aaron gave in to their request and used their gold earrings to make them an idol in the form of a golden calf.<br>
<br>
That made God angry and He was prepared to destroy them. Thankfully for them, Moses convinced God to relent from his anger, but in the end, they were still punished. About 3,000 of them died because of actions stemming from impatience (Genesis 32:28).<br>
<br>
A lesson that stands out in the story of the golden calf is that our impatience could cause us to seek inferior substitutes. In the case of the Israelites, Moses' delay led them to find an idol to worship instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And that concludes the selected quotations from the 2022 article by Moses Pierre-Paul.<br>
<br>
Another example of impatience can be seen in Jasher chapter 75.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jasher chapter 75, all of chapter 75, all 22 verses -- from the J.H. Parry and Company 1887 English Translation<br>
1 At that time, in the hundred and eightieth year of the Israelites going down into Egypt, there went forth from Egypt valiant men, thirty thousand on foot, from the children of Israel, who were all of the tribe of Joseph, of the children of Ephraim the son of Joseph.<br>
2 For they said the period was completed which the Lord had appointed to the children of Israel in the times of old, which he had spoken to Abraham.<br>
3 And these men girded themselves, and they put each man his sword at his side, and every man his armour upon him, and they trusted to their strength, and they went out together from Egypt with a mighty hand.<br>
4 But they brought no provision for the road, only silver and gold, not even bread for that day did they bring in their hands, for they thought of getting their provision for pay from the Philistines, and if not they would take it by force.<br>
5 And these men were very mighty and valiant men, one man could pursue a thousand and two could rout ten thousand, so they trusted to their strength and went together as they were.<br>
6 And they directed their course toward the land of Gath, and they went down and found the shepherds of Gath feeding the cattle of the children of Gath.<br>
7 And they said to the shepherds, Give us some of the sheep for pay, that we may eat, for we are hungry, for we have eaten no bread this day.<br>
8 And the shepherds said, Are they our sheep or cattle that we should give them to you even for pay? so the children of Ephraim approached to take them by force.<br>
9 And the shepherds of Gath shouted over them that their cry was heard at a distance, so all the children of Gath went out to them.<br>
<br>
10 And when the children of Gath saw the evil doings of the children of Ephraim, they returned and assembled the men of Gath, and they put on each man his armour, and came forth to the children of Ephraim for battle.<br>
11 And they engaged with them in the valley of Gath, and the battle was severe, and they smote from each other a great many on that day.<br>
12 And on the second day the children of Gath sent to all the cities of the Philistines that they should come to their help, saying,<br>
13 Come up unto us and help us, that we may smite the children of Ephraim who have come forth from Egypt to take our cattle, and to fight against us without cause.<br>
14 Now the souls of the children of Ephraim were exhausted with hunger and thirst, for they had eaten no bread for three days. And forty thousand men went forth from the cities of the Philistines to the assistance of the men of Gath.<br>
15 And these men were engaged in battle with the children of Ephraim, and the Lord delivered the children of Ephraim into the hands of the Philistines.<br>
16 And they smote all the children of Ephraim, all who had gone forth from Egypt, none were remaining but ten men who had run away from the engagement.<br>
<br>
17 For this evil was from the Lord against the children of Ephraim, for they transgressed the word of the Lord in going forth from Egypt, before the period had arrived which the Lord in the days of old had appointed to Israel.<br>
18 And of the Philistines also there fell a great many, about twenty thousand men, and their brethren carried them and buried them in their cities.<br>
19 And the slain of the children of Ephraim remained forsaken in the valley of Gath for many days and years, and were not brought to burial, and the valley was filled with men's bones.<br>
20 And the men who had escaped from the battle came to Egypt, and told all the children of Israel all that had befallen them.<br>
21 And their father Ephraim mourned over them for many days, and his brethren came to console him.<br>
22 And he came unto his wife and she bare a son, and he called his name Beriah, for she was unfortunate in his house.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
This story might sound like it has a sad ending.<br>
But this right here may not be the end. There is something going on in Ezekiel 37.<br>
We were looking at what appears to be a restoration of them<br>
in the Bible study, titled, Dry Bones, which we were looking at<br>
when we were in<br>
Christian Essays 3, which is, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 3.<br>
Here is a quick review of some things from that Bible study, titled, Dry Bones.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Abraham was told that all his offspring, which would eventually be known as the Israelites,<br>
would all be living in Egypt for a certain number of years.<br>
Then, they would leave Egypt and all go to the promised land.<br>
Here in Jasher chapter 75, some impatient people thought that it was time to leave Egypt, so they just got up and tried to leave.<br>
They were wrong.<br>
They did not know that there was a future plan for someone named Moses to eventually escort them all out of Egypt.<br>
Did any of these people think to stop and ask and pray to the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah?<br>
Pray to Him, ask him what we should do next. Seek Him first and wait for His answer.<br>
Did Abraham and Sarah pray about it before they decided to help God out by making a baby for them, using Sarah's servant Hagar?<br>
Did Aaron and the Israelites pray about it before deciding to make a gold calf?<br>
Did Lot pray about it before deciding to move to Sodom and Gomorrah?<br>
Let's just say that, the way how the men of Sodom and Gomorrah say hello to each other is not done by using a nice, firm handshake.<br>
Are you going to pray about it before you make a big move or take an important job or make a major financial decision?<br>
<br>
God is Love, Love is patient and kind.<br>
What if God, ELL-Low-Heem, Love and patience are all interconnected?<br>
Choosing not to have patience, means no patience, which equals, no love and no God.<br>
God and love and patience are all connected to each other.<br>
Turning off patience can also turn off love, and can turn you off to God, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
Pray. <br>
Sometimes the answer is, Yes.<br>
Sometimes the answer is, No.<br>
Sometimes the answer is, Wait.<br>
Sometimes His answer is, "Interesting. Let's spend some more time together talking about this and praying about this some more."<br>
Sometimes the answer is, what does the Bible say about this thing you're praying about right now?<br>
Seek Him first, then wait for His answer in His good timing and His due season, not yours.<br>
Not in your season, in His season.<br>
<br>
Psalms 62:1 KJV<br>
Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.<br>
<br>

But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.<br>
<br>
Psalms 62:5 KJV<br>
My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.<br>
<br>
KJV:<br>
Psalms 25:3 -- Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed....<br>
Psalms 25:21 -- Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:14 KJV<br>
Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:14 NLT<br>
Wait patiently for the Lord.<br>
Be brave and courageous.<br>
Yes, wait patiently for the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7:7 KJV<br>
Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 3:1 KJV<br>
To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:9 KJV<br>
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:9 NLT<br>
So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 1:3 KJV<br>
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither (shall not fade); and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.<br>
<br>
<br>
We now conclude by remembering some verses shared in<br>
the Bible Study about times and seasons,<br>
Which is right after random Bible verse number 501,<br>
on the Parallel Bible Page, which is, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter Zero.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 2:21 (KJV)<br>
and he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:<br>
<br>
Daniel 2:21 (NLT)<br>
He controls the course of world events; he removes kings and sets up other kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the scholars.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 1:7 KJV<br>
...It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.<br>
<br>
Acts 1: 7-9 NLT<br>
7 He replied, "The Father alone has the authority to set those dates and times, and they are not for you to know.<br>
8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere -- in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."<br>
9 After saying this, he was taken up into a cloud while they were watching, and they could no longer see him.<br>

Matthew 16:24 -- KJV<br>
...take up his cross and follow me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 16:24 -- Hebrew to English Translation, from The Hebrew Gospels<br>
...take his lengthwise and crosswise and follow after me.<br>
...take his warp and woof and follow after me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
What is, "warp and woof?"<br>
<br>
In this context, "warp and woof" refers to the fundamental elements of a person's life or character.<br>
This phrase originates from textile weaving, where the "warp" are the vertical threads<br>
and the "woof" (or "weft") are the horizontal threads. Together, they create the fabric.<br>
<br>
Woof/weft are passed over and under the fixed threads of the warp.<br>
Warp is the set of threads going under and over.<br>
<br>
Woof/weft goes horizontally over and under the warp, and<br>
warp goes vertically under and over the weft.<br>
<br>
<br>
As of January of 2026:<br>
Chambers 21st Century Dictionary:<br>
Woof is the weft, the texture of a fabric.<br>
Weft are the threads that are (horizontally) passed over and under the fixed threads of the warp in a loom.<br>
Weft is the thread carried by the shuttle (also called woof).<br>
In weaving, the warp is the set of threads stretched lengthways in a loom.<br>
The warp passes (vertically) under and over the widthways (the horizontal) set of threads (the weft or woof).<br>
<br>
<br>
So, again, in textile weaving, the "warp" are the vertical threads,<br>
and the "woof" (or "weft") are the horizontal threads, going across the length in a loom.<br>
<br>
Could warp and woof be a picture of obeying the two greatest commandments?<br>
<br>
Matthew 22: 35-40 (KJV)<br>
35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,<br>
36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<br>
37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<br>
38 This is the first and great commandment.<br>
39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
On these two greatest commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<br>
Hang out with Jesus, He hung out for you.<br>
<br>
By using "warp and woof," Yaw-Who-Shaw (Jesus) is likely urging his students to consider the entire fabric of their being or essence when choosing to follow Him. It emphasises the need to integrate and weave their core values, beliefs, and identity into their commitment, suggesting a total dedication and transformation in their way of life.<br>
<br>
In this context, "warp and woof" signifies the very foundation of who they are, encouraging the students to bring their whole selves into the journey of following Him.<br>
If they do not do this, they cannot be His student.<br>
If YOU do not do this, YOU cannot be His student.<br>
<br>
Luke 14:27 -- KJV<br>
And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.<br>
<br>
We will read Luke 14:27 again, here, in just a moment.<br>

The Hebrew Gospels<br>
from Sepharad<br>
The Gospel according to<br>
Matthew<br>
Translated by Justin J. Van Rensburg<br>
Version 2.2 -- March 2021<br>
A literal translation of a medieval Hebrew manuscript in the Vatican Library<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 16: 24-26 -- Hebrew to English Translation<br>
<br>
Talmidim are the students who learn from their teacher and follow his example.<br>
The Hebrew 'Talmid' is a student who learns from his teacher and follows his example.<br>
"Talmidim" is the masculine plural form.<br>
Talmid is a student, which is a disciple.<br>
Disciples is a plural word which means, students.<br>
<br>
(And then Yaw-Who-Shaw said to his talmidim, (his students, his disciples,)  "Whosoever wants to follow after me -- it is obligated that he should give up hope for himself, and that<br>
he take his warp and woof and follow after me.)<br>
<br>
24 And then Yaw-Who-Shaw said to his students, "Whosoever wants to follow after me is obligated that he should give up hope for himself, and that he take his warp and woof and follow after me.<br>
<br>
(Whosoever wants to follow after me is obligated that he should give up hope for himself, and that<br>
he take his lengthwise and crosswise and follow after me.)<br>
<br>
(lengthwise and crosswise was used in medieval Hebrew to refer to a 'cross.')<br>
<br>
25 For he who wants to save his breath, life or soul in this world can save it, but he will lose it because of me.<br>
<br>
(For he who wants to save his breath, life or soul in this world will save it when he loses it for me.)<br>
<br>
<br>
26 What will it profit a man if he gains all the underground treasures of the world, and the breath, life or soul is lost?<br>
<br>
(What will it profit a man if he gains all the secret treasures of the world, and the breath, life or soul is lost?)<br>
<br>
And what good exchange is the man able to make for his breath, life or soul?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
...take up his cross and follow me. (Mark 8:34)<br>

<br>
Mark 8: 34-36 -- Hebrew to English Translation<br>
34 And he called the people and his talmidim, (his students, his disciples,) and said to them, "He who wants to follow after me must deny himself, and take (and bring) warp and woof with him, and follow after me.<br>
35 And whosoever wants to save his life, (his breath, life, or soul) he will lose it. But he who loses it because of me, and because of the good news, he will save it.<br>
36 And what will it profit a man, even if he will have all the world for himself, (even if he owns all the world) but he loses his breath, life, or soul?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
...take up his cross daily and follow me. (Luke 9:23)<br>
<br>
Luke 9:23 & 24 -- KJV<br>
9:23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.<br>
9:24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 9:23 & 24 -- NLT<br>
23 Then he said to the crowd, "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross daily, and follow me.<br>
24 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 9: 23-25 -- TS2009<br>
23 And He said to them all, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his stake daily, and follow Me.<br>
24 "For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake shall save it.<br>
25 For what is a man profited if he gains all the world, and is himself destroyed or lost?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 14: 26 & 27 -- KJV<br>
14:26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.<br>
14:27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 14: 26 & 27 -- NLT<br>
26 "If you want to be my disciple, you must, by comparison, hate everyone else -- your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters -- yes, even your own life. Otherwise, you cannot be my disciple.<br>
27 And if you do not carry your own cross and follow me, you cannot be my disciple.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 14: 26 & 27 -- TS2009<br>
<br>
(If anyone comes to Me and does not love less his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and his own life too, he is unable to be My taught one.)<br>
<br>
26 If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and his own life too, he is unable to be My taught one.<br>
27 "And whoever does not bear his stake and come after Me is unable to be My taught one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What we have just looked at here in Luke 14: 26 & 27,<br>
this concept of hating the world,<br>
could be poinitng to something found at the End of the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the Bible study that we did earlier, here on this page, here in Christian Essays 33, titled,<br>
They Love His Holy Name<br>
<br>
we saw something there that this could be referring to in the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
Loving ELL-Low-Heem more, and loving everything else in the world less.<br>
Here is part of that again.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found at the End of the Book of Enoch 108: 8 & 9<br>
8. who loved God, and did not love gold or silver or all the riches of the world, but gave over their bodies to torture;<br>
9. and who, since they existed, did not long for terrestrial food, but considered themselves a breath that passes away, and lived accordingly, and were often tried by God, and their spirits were found in cleanness to praise his name.<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found at the End of the Book of Enoch 105: 23-26<br>
...the spirits of the humble; to those who have suffered in their bodies, but have been rewarded by God; who have been injuriously treated by wicked men; who have loved God; who have been attached neither to gold nor silver, nor to any good thing in the world, but have given their bodies to torment;<br>
<br>
(To those who from the time they were have not been covetous of earthly riches;)<br>
24. To those who from the period of their birth have not been covetous of earthly riches; but have regarded themselves as a breath passing away.<br>
<br>
(And this have they kept)<br>
25. Such has been their conduct; and much has the Lord tried them; and their spirits have been found pure, that they might bless his name.<br>
All their blessings have I related in a book; and He has rewarded them; for they have been found to love heaven with an everlasting aspiration. God has said, Whilst they have been trodden down by wicked men, they have heard from them revilings and blasphemies; and have been ignominiously treated, whilst they were blessing me. And now will I call the spirits of the good from the generation of light, and will change those who have been born in darkness; who have not in their bodies been recompensed with glory, as their faith may have merited.<br>
26. I will bring them into the splendid light of those who love my holy name: and I will place each of them on a throne of glory, of glory peculiarly his own, and they shall be at rest during unnumbered periods. Righteous is the judgement of God;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Right after Jesus gets all done talking about<br>
evil spirits entering into a person and living inside someone and controlling someone,<br>
right at that moment, a woman in the crowd suddenly says this...<br>
<br>
Luke 11:27 & 28 -- KJV<br>
11:27 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.<br>
11:28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11:27 & 28 -- NLT<br>
27 As he was speaking, a woman in the crowd called out, "God bless your mother -- the womb from which you came, and the breasts that nursed you!"<br>
28 Jesus replied, "But even more blessed are all who hear the word of God and put it into practice."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11:27 & 28 -- TS2009<br>
27 And it came to be, as He was saying this, a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, "Blessed is the womb that bore You, and the breasts which You sucked!"<br>
28 But He said, "Blessed rather are those hearing the Word of ELL-Low-Heem and watching over it!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What are the very last words that Jesus' mother says in the Bible?<br>
Her final and last words are in John 2:5.<br>
She points to his son, Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, and she tells the servants this...<br>
<br>
John 2:5 -- KJV<br>
His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 2:5 -- NLT<br>
But his mother told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."<br>
<br>
John 2:5 -- TS2009<br>
His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever He says to you."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you His servant, His good and faithful servant?<br>
Do whatever he tells you.<br>
The Bible does not tell us to pray to Mary.<br>
The Bible never told you to do that, ever!<br>
The Bible does not tell us to pray to Mary, but please follow her final advice!<br>
Do whatever Yaw-Who-Shaw tells you.<br>
Obey Yaw-Who-Shaw, study and obey your Bible!<br>
<br>

Commentary: In early August of 2023, our family was going through a long and difficult season, more than two years, and counting, with no idea on how much longer and when or if things would get better, or not. The kind of thoughts and feelings that can be stirring in one's heart, mind and soul, in seasons of affliction, can be difficult to put into words. One morning, my wife, decided to open up her Eth Cepher to a random page, and she just happened to land on Psalms 77.<br>
<br>
The kinds of questions and thoughts of doubt, difficult to say or pray, were all right there in Psalms 77.  It validated the feelings that one might have in stressful, uncertain times of difficulty. And then, just a couple of days later, on the first Sabbath (Shuh-Bot) day of rest in August 2023, we all decided to watch, for the first time, The Chosen TV Series, Season 3, Episode 8.  And, guess what! Episode 8 starts off with Asaph reading Psalms 77.<br>
<br>
With all of that, this Bible study just happens to feature some verses that just might be referencing some of the content and scenes in The Chosen TV Series, Season 3, Episode 8. Let's begin by reading Psalms 77. You also just might find some things in there that seem to be talking about some of the things that you have been going through, and the questions and doubts that might come across the minds, hearts and souls of believers everywhere, all around the world.<br>
<br>
I'd rather not say it or pray it quite like that, but there it is, anyway. It validates our feelings. He gets us. He's got this. Don't give up.<br>

Psalms 77,<br>
All of Psalms 77, all 20 verses -- KJV<br>
77:1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.<br>
<br>
77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord:<br>
(my hand ran in the night,)<br>
my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.<br>
<br>
77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.<br>
77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.<br>
77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.<br>
77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.<br>
77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?<br>
<br>
77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?<br>
(doth his promise fail to generation and generation?)<br>
<br>
77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.<br>
77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.<br>
77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.<br>
77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.<br>
77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?<br>
77:14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength amongst the people.<br>
77:15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.<br>
77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.<br>
(The clouds were poured forth with water:)<br>
77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.<br>
<br>
77:18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.<br>
77:19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.<br>
77:20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.<br>

All of Psalms 77, all 20 verses -- NLT<br>
For Jeduthun, the choir director: A psalm of Asaph.<br>
1<br>
I cry out to God; yes, I shout.<br>
Oh, that God would listen to me!<br>
2<br>
When I was in deep trouble,<br>
I searched for the Lord.<br>
All night long I prayed, with hands lifted toward heaven,<br>
but my soul was not comforted.<br>
3<br>
I think of God, and I moan,<br>
overwhelmed with longing for his help.<br>
Interlude<br>
4<br>
You don't let me sleep.<br>
I am too distressed even to pray!<br>
5<br>
I think of the good old days,<br>
long since ended,<br>
6<br>
when my nights were filled with joyful songs.<br>
I search my soul and ponder the difference now.<br>
7<br>
Has the Lord rejected me forever?<br>
Will he never again be kind to me?<br>
8<br>
Is his unfailing love gone forever?<br>
Have his promises permanently failed?<br>
9<br>
Has God forgotten to be gracious?<br>
Has he slammed the door on his compassion?<br>
Interlude<br>
10<br>
And I said, "This is my fate;<br>
the Most High has turned his hand against me."<br>
11<br>
But then I recall all you have done, O Lord;<br>
I remember your wonderful deeds of long ago.<br>
12<br>
They are constantly in my thoughts.<br>
I cannot stop thinking about your mighty works.<br>
13<br>
O God, your ways are holy.<br>
Is there any god as mighty as you?<br>
14<br>
You are the God of great wonders!<br>
You demonstrate your awesome power amongst the nations.<br>
15<br>
By your strong arm, you redeemed your people,<br>
the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.<br>
Interlude<br>
16<br>
(When the waters saw you, O God,)<br>
When the Red Sea saw you, O God,<br>
its waters looked and trembled!<br>
The sea quaked to its very depths.<br>
17<br>
The clouds poured down rain;<br>
the thunder rumbled in the sky.<br>
Your arrows of lightning flashed.<br>
18<br>
Your thunder roared from the whirlwind;<br>
the lightning lit up the world!<br>
The earth trembled and shook.<br>
19<br>
Your road led through the sea,<br>
your pathway through the mighty waters --<br>
a pathway no one knew was there!<br>
20<br>
You led your people along that road like a flock of sheep,<br>
with Moses and Aaron as their shepherds.<br>

All of Psalms 77, all 20 verses -- TS2009<br>
1 My voice is to ELL-Low-Heem, and I cry; My voice is to ELL-Low-Heem, and He listened to me.<br>
2 In the day of my distress I sought Yaw-Who-Wah; My hand was stretched out in the night And it did not cease, My being refused to be comforted.<br>
3 I remembered ELL-Low-Heem, and groaned; I complained, and my spirit grew faint. Selah.<br>
4 You ceased the watches of my eyes, I was too troubled to speak.<br>
5 I have thought about the days of old, The years long past.<br>
6 I remember my song in the night, I meditate within my heart, And my spirit searches diligently.<br>
7 Would Yaw-Who-Wah reject forever, And never again be pleased?<br>
8 Has His loving-commitment ceased forever, Has the promise failed for all generations?<br>
9 Has ELL forgotten to show favour? Has He shut up His compassions in displeasure? Selah.<br>
10 And I said, "This is my grief: That the right hand of the Most High has changed."<br>
11 I remember the deeds of Yah, For I remember Your wonders of old.<br>
12 And I shall meditate on all Your work, And talk of Your deeds.<br>
13 Your way, O ELL-Low-Heem, is in Set-apartness; Who is a great ELL like ELL-Low-Heem?<br>
14 You are the ELL who does wonders; You have made known Your strength amongst the peoples.<br>
15 By Your arm You have redeemed Your people, The sons of Yah-Coab and Yoh-Sef. Selah.<br>
16 The waters saw You, O ELL-Low-Heem; The waters saw You, they were afraid; The depths also trembled.<br>
17 The clouds poured out water; The heavens rumbled; Also, Your arrows flashed back and forth.<br>
18 The voice of Your thunder rolled along; Lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.<br>
19 Your way was in the sea, And Your path in the great waters, And Your footsteps were not known.<br>
20 You did lead Your people like a flock By the hand of Moe-Shay and Aharon.<br>

107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;<br>
107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.<br>
(and from the sea.)<br>
107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.<br>
107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.<br>
107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.<br>
107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.<br>

Some wandered in the wilderness,<br>
lost and homeless.<br>
5<br>
Hungry and thirsty,<br>
they nearly died.<br>
6<br>
"Lord, help!" they cried in their trouble,<br>
and he rescued them from their distress.<br>
7<br>
He led them straight to safety,<br>
to a city where they could live.<br>
8<br>
Let them praise the Lord for his great love<br>

4 They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert way; They found no city to dwell in.<br>
5 Hungry and thirsty, Their being in them grew faint.<br>
6 Then they cried out to Yaw-Who-Wah in their distress, He delivered them out of their troubles.<br>
7 And He guided them by the right way, To go to a city to settle.<br>
8 Let them give thanks to Yaw-Who-Wah for His loving-commitment, And His wonders to the children of men!<br>

Next, we go to the book of John, and we read what sounds like a different story with a different ending...<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6: 19-21 (KJV)<br>
6:19 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.<br>
6:20 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.<br>
6:21 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6: 19-21 -- NLT<br>
(They had rowed 25 or 30 stadia, which is 4.6 or 5.5 kilometres,)<br>
19 They had rowed three or four miles when suddenly they saw Jesus walking on the water toward the boat. They were terrified,<br>
(But he called out to them, I am. The 'I Am' is here.)<br>
20 but he called out to them, "Don't be afraid. I am here!"<br>
21 Then they were eager to let him in the boat, and immediately they arrived at their destination!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6: 19-21 -- TS2009<br>
(When they had rowed about 5 to 6 kilometres, or, 3 to 4 miles,)<br>

20 And He said to them, "It is I, do not be afraid."<br>
21 They wished therefore to take Him into the boat, and at once the boat was at the land where they were going.<br>

<br>
James 4:7 (KJV)<br>
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: paraphrase of a part of verse 9 (NLT)<br>
Stand firm against (your great enemy, the devil,) and be strong in your faith.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5:9 (KJV)<br>
whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: end of verse 9 (NLT)<br>
...Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
It does not say, families...are going through....<br>
It says, family...is going through.<br>
We are all one single family of many believers all over the world.<br>
We are different body parts of one single body, with the Messiah being the head of this one single body, this one single family.<br>
In the English translations, the saved believers that are going to heaven are all part of one single, big family.<br>
These family members are known as, brothers and sisters, and they are sometimes just called, brothers or brethren.<br>
<br>
The Bible also teaches that, of the saved believers that are going to heaven, there are only a small number of them.<br>
Most people are not going to heaven. Only a small number are the saved believers that are going to heaven.<br>
As for those saved believers that are going to heaven, the bible promises them a life of difficulty, troubles, trials, tribulations, persecutions, afflictions and sufferings, here in this world, before they go to heaven.<br>
The evil spirits of darkness living in the unbelievers hate the light that lives in the saved believers.<br>
The people going to hell hate the saved believers that are going to heaven.<br>
Here are some of the Bible verses that tell us all of this...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: 8 & 9 (NLT)<br>
8 Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.<br>
9 Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.<br>
(Remember that your brotherhood all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.)<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: 8 & 9 -- KJV<br>
5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br>
5:9 Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<br>
<br>
Once again...<br>
James 4:7 (KJV)<br>
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
<br>
James 4:7 (NLT)<br>
So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
<br>
James 4:7 -- TS2009<br>
So then subject yourselves to Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem). Resist the devil and he shall flee from you.<br>
(Resist the adversary and he shall flee from you.)<br>

James 4: 11 & 12 (KJV)<br>
4:11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.<br>
4:12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?<br>
<br>
<br>
James 4: 11 & 12 -- NLT<br>
11 Don't speak evil against each other, dear brothers and sisters. If you criticise and judge each other, then you are criticising and judging God's law. But your job is to obey the law, not to judge whether it applies to you.<br>
12 God alone, who gave the law, is the Judge. He alone has the power to save or to destroy. So what right do you have to judge your neighbour?<br>
<br>
<br>
James 4: 11 & 12 -- TS2009<br>
11 Brothers, do not speak against one another. He that speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against Torah and judges Torah. And if you judge Torah, you are not a doer of Torah but a judge.<br>
12 There is one Lawgiver and Judge, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another?<br>

For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, (or Greeks,) whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.<br>

Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.<br>

1 John 3: 13-18 (KJV)<br>
3:13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.<br>
3:14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.<br>
3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.<br>
3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<br>
3:17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?<br>
3:18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 3: 13-18 -- NLT<br>
13 So don't be surprised, dear brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.<br>
(If we love our brothers,)<br>
14 If we love our brothers and sisters who are believers, it proves that we have passed from death to life. But a person who has no love is still dead.<br>
15 Anyone who hates another brother or sister is really a murderer at heart. And you know that murderers don't have eternal life within them.<br>
16 We know what real love is because Jesus gave up his life for us. So we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters.<br>
17 If someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister in need but shows no compassion -- how can God's love be in that person?<br>
18 Dear children, let's not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 3: 13-19 -- TS2009<br>
13 Do not marvel, my brothers, if the world hates you.<br>
14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. The one not loving his brother stays in death.<br>
15 Everyone hating his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has everlasting life staying in him.<br>
16 By this we have known love, because He laid down His life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.<br>
17 But whoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his tender affections from him, how does the love of Elohim stay in him?<br>
18 My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.<br>
19 And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall set our hearts at rest before Him,<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Revelation 2:10 -- NLT<br>

26 He thought it was better to suffer for the sake of Christ than to own the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his great reward.<br>

4 so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:<br>
5 which is a manifest token of the righteous judgement of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:<br>
6 seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;<br>
<br>
7 and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,<br>
(and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power,)<br>
(in flaming fire yielding vengeance on them that know not God,)<br>
8 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:<br>
<br>
9 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;<br>
10 when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony amongst you was believed) in that day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 1: 3-11 -- NLT<br>
3 Dear brothers and sisters, we can't help but thank God for you, because your faith is flourishing and your love for one another is growing.<br>
4 We proudly tell God's other churches about your endurance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and hardships you are suffering.<br>
5 And God will use this persecution to show his justice and to make you worthy of his Kingdom, for which you are suffering.<br>
6 In his justice he will pay back those who persecute you.<br>
7 And God will provide rest for you who are being persecuted and also for us when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven. He will come with his mighty angels,<br>
8 in flaming fire, bringing judgement on those who don't know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus.<br>
9 They will be punished with eternal destruction, forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power.<br>
10 When he comes on that day, he will receive glory from his holy people -- praise from all who believe. And this includes you, for you believed what we told you about him.<br>
11 So we keep on praying for you, asking our God to enable you to live a life worthy of his call. May he give you the power to accomplish all the good things your faith prompts you to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 1: 3-12 -- TS2009<br>
3 We ought to give thanks to Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem) always for you, brothers, as it is proper, because your belief grows exceedingly, and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing,<br>
4 so that we ourselves boast of you amongst the assemblies of Elohim for your endurance and belief in all your persecutions and afflictions which you are bearing,<br>
5 clear evidence of the righteous judgement of Elohim, in order for you to be counted worthy of the reign of Elohim, for which you also suffer,<br>
6 since Elohim shall rightly repay with affliction those who afflict you,<br>
7 and to give you who are afflicted rest with us when the Master Yaw-Who-Shaw is revealed from heaven with His mighty messengers,<br>
8 in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know Elohim, and on those who do not obey the Good News of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck,<br>
9 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Master and from the esteem of His strength,<br>
10 when He comes to be esteemed in His set-apart ones and to be admired amongst all those who believe in that Day, because our witness to you was believed.<br>
11 To this end we always pray for you that our Elohim would count you worthy of this calling, and complete all the good pleasure of goodness, and the work of belief with power,<br>
12 so that the Name of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck is esteemed in you, and you in Him, according to the favour of our Elohim and the Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1: 3-11 KJV<br>
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
(which according to his much mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope)<br>
which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,<br>
<br>
4 to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,<br>
(reserved in heaven for us,)<br>
5 who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.<br>
6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:<br>
7 that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:<br>
8 whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:<br>
9 receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.<br>
10 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:<br>
11 searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1: 3-11 -- NLT<br>
3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is by his great mercy that we have been born again, because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Now we live with great expectation,<br>
4 and we have a priceless inheritance -- an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay.<br>
5 And through your faith, God is protecting you by his power until you receive this salvation, which is ready to be revealed on the last day for all to see.<br>
(So you are truly glad.)<br>
6 So be truly glad. There is wonderful joy ahead, even though you must endure many trials for a little while.<br>
7 These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold -- though your faith is far more precious than mere gold. So when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you much praise and glory and honour on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world.<br>
8 You love him even though you have never seen him. Though you do not see him now, you trust him; and you rejoice with a glorious, inexpressible joy.<br>
9 The reward for trusting him will be the salvation of your souls.<br>
10 This salvation was something even the prophets wanted to know more about when they prophesied about this gracious salvation prepared for you.<br>
11 They wondered what time or situation the Spirit of Christ within them was talking about when he told them in advance about Christ's suffering and his great glory afterward.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1: 3-11 -- TS2009<br>
3 Blessed be the Elohim and Father of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck, who according to His great compassion has caused us to be born again to a living expectation through the resurrection of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck from the dead,<br>
4 to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, having been kept in the heavens for you,<br>
5 who are protected by the power of Elohim through belief, for a deliverance ready to be revealed in the last time,<br>
6 in which you exult, even though for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by manifold trials,<br>
7 in order that the proving of your belief  --  much more precious than gold that perishes, and proven by fire -- might be found to result in praise and respect and esteem at the revelation of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck,<br>
8 whom having not seen, you love; in whom you exult with unspeakable and esteemed joy, yet not seeing, but believing,<br>
9 obtaining the goal of your belief: a deliverance of lives.<br>
10 Concerning this deliverance the prophets have sought out and searched out, prophesying concerning the favour for you,<br>
11 searching to know what, or what sort of time, the Spirit which was in them was pointing out concerning Messiah (Muh-Shee-Uck), when it was bearing witness beforehand the sufferings of Messiah, and the esteems that would follow,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 3-6 KJV<br>
3 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;<br>
4 who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.<br>
5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.<br>
6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation,<br>
(which is wrought in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:)<br>
which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 3-6 -- NLT<br>
3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is our merciful Father and the source of all comfort.<br>
4 He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others. When they are troubled, we will be able to give them the same comfort God has given us.<br>
5 For the more we suffer for Christ, the more God will shower us with his comfort through Christ.<br>
6 Even when we are weighed down with troubles, it is for your comfort and salvation! For when we ourselves are comforted, we will certainly comfort you. Then you can patiently endure the same things we suffer.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 3-7 -- TS2009<br>
3 Blessed be the Elohim and Father of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck, the Father of compassion and Elohim of all comfort,<br>
4 who is comforting us in all our pressure, enabling us to comfort those who are in every pressure, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by Elohim.<br>
5 Because, as the sufferings of Messiah overflow in us, so our comfort also overflows through Messiah (Muh-Shee-Uck).<br>
6 And if we suffer pressure, it is for your comfort and deliverance, being worked out in enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort and deliverance.<br>
7 And our expectation for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are sharing in the sufferings  --  so also in the comfort.<br>

7:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:<br>

14 "Because the gate is narrow and the way is hard pressed which leads to life, and there are few who find it.<br>
<br>
<br>

Throughout the ages<br>

Great in majesty divine<br>
Great in Your salvation,<br>
Be great in my life<br>
<br>
Great in love and mercy<br>
Great in perfect sacrifice<br>
Great in resurrection,<br>
Be great in my life<br>

There is a city<br>
Shining high above the stars<br>
You call me closer<br>
To discover who You are<br>
<br>
This is my purpose<br>
That I would know the risen Christ<br>
So let Your kingdom,<br>
Be great in my life<br>
<br>
Great in power and glory<br>
Great in majesty divine<br>
Great in Your salvation,<br>
Be great in my life<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember those walls that we called sin and shame<br>
They were like prisons that we couldn't escape<br>
But He came and He died and He rose<br>
Those walls are rubble now<br>
<br>
Remember those giants we called death and grave<br>
They were like mountains that stood in our way<br>
But He came and He died and He rose<br>
Those giants are dead now<br>
<br>
This is our God<br>
This is who He is<br>
He loves us<br>
This is our God<br>
This is what He does<br>
He saves us<br>
He bore the cross<br>
Beat the grave<br>
Let heaven and earth proclaim<br>
This is our God<br>
King Jesus<br>
<br>
Remember that fear that took our breath away<br>
Faith so weak that we could barely pray<br>
But He heard every word, every whisper<br>
<br>
Now those altars in the wilderness<br>
Tell the story of His faithfulness<br>
Never once did He fail and He never will<br>
<br>
<br>
This is our God<br>
This is who He is<br>
He loves us<br>
This is our God<br>
This is what He does<br>
He saves us<br>
He bore the cross<br>
Beat the grave<br>
Let heaven and earth proclaim<br>
This is our God<br>
King Jesus<br>
<br>
<br>
Who pulled me out of that pit<br>
He did, He did<br>
Who paid for all of our sin<br>
Nobody but Jesus<br>
<br>
Who pulled me out of that pit<br>
He did, He did<br>
Who paid for all of our sin<br>
Nobody but Jesus<br>
<br>
Who rescued me from that grave<br>
Yahweh, Yahweh<br>
Who gets the glory and praise<br>
Nobody but Jesus<br>
<br>
Who rescued me from that grave<br>
Yahweh, Yahweh<br>
Who gets the glory and praise<br>
Nobody but Him<br>
<br>
<br>
This is our God<br>
This is who He is<br>
He loves us<br>
This is our God<br>
This is what He does<br>
He saves us<br>
He bore the cross<br>
Beat the grave<br>

In Acts 14, Paul and Barnabas preach in Iconium,<br>
then they go to Lystra and Derbe.<br>
When Paul and Barnabas Return to Antioch of Syria, they preach this message...<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 14: 21-23 -- KJV<br>
14:21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,<br>
14:22 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.<br>
14:23 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts of the Apostles 14: 21-23 -- NLT<br>
21 After preaching the Good News in Derbe and making many disciples, Paul and Barnabas returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch of Pisidia,<br>
22 where they strengthened the believers. They encouraged them to continue in the faith, reminding them that we must suffer many hardships to enter the Kingdom of God.<br>
23 Paul and Barnabas also appointed elders in every church. With prayer and fasting, they turned the elders over to the care of the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 14: 21-23 -- TS2009<br>
21 And having brought the Good News to that city, and having made many taught ones, they returned to Lustra, and Ikonion, and Antioch,<br>
22 strengthening the beings of the taught ones, encouraging them to continue in the belief, and that through many pressures we have to enter the reign of Elohim.<br>
23 And having appointed elders in every assembly, having prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Master in whom they had believed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If we summarise verse 22, as it was seen in these three English translations,<br>
They were strengthening the students, which are known as the disciples.<br>
They were students that were studying the Bible, studying and learning and doing what the Bible says.<br>
They were strengthening the students, making the students stronger.<br>
They were encouraging these students to continue in their belief and faith, reminding them that<br>
we must go through many tribulations, many sufferings, many hardships, and many pressures to enter into the reign and Kingdom of ELL-Low-Heem, the Kingdom of Heaven, the Kingdom of God.<br>

28 Jesus knew that his mission was now finished, and to fulfil Scripture he said, "I am thirsty."<br>
29 A jar of sour wine was sitting there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put it on a hyssop branch, and held it up to his lips.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;<br>
and for comforters, but I found none.<br>

You know of my shame, scorn, and disgrace.<br>
You see all that my enemies are doing.<br>
20<br>
Their insults have broken my heart,<br>
and I am in despair.<br>
If only one person would show some pity;<br>
if only one would turn and comfort me.<br>
<br>
21<br>
But instead, they give me poison for food;<br>
(they give me gall for food;)<br>
they offer me sour wine for my thirst.<br>

15:19	If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.<br>
15:20	Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.<br>
15:21	But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.<br>
15:22	If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:<br>
(but now they have no excuse for their sin.)<br>
but now they have no cloke for their sin.<br>
15:23	He that hateth me hateth my Father also.<br>
15:24	If I had not done amongst them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<br>
15:25	But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.<br>

John 15: 18-25 -- NLT<br>
18 "If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first.<br>
19 The world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it, but you are no longer part of the world. I chose you to come out of the world, so it hates you.<br>
20 Do you remember what I told you? 'A slave is not greater than the master.' Since they persecuted me, naturally they will persecute you. And if they had listened to me, they would listen to you.<br>
21 They will do all this to you because of me, for they have rejected the one who sent me.<br>
22 They would not be guilty if I had not come and spoken to them. But now they have no excuse for their sin.<br>
23 Anyone who hates me also hates my Father.<br>
24 If I hadn't done such miraculous signs amongst them that no one else could do, they would not be guilty. But as it is, they have seen everything I did, yet they still hate me and my Father.<br>
(This fulfils what is written in their law:)<br>
25 This fulfils what is written in their Scriptures: 'They hated me without cause.'<br>

John 15: 18-25 -- TS2009<br>
18 If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you.<br>
19 "If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, for that reason the world hates you.<br>
20 "Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they shall persecute you too. If they have guarded My Word, they would guard yours too.<br>
21 "But all this they shall do to you because of My Name, because they do not know Him who sent Me.<br>
22 "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.<br>
23 "He who hates Me hates My Father as well.<br>
24 If I did not do amongst them the works which no one else did, they would have no sin. But now they have both seen and have hated both Me and My Father,"<br>
25 but...that the word might be filled which was written in their Torah, 'They hated Me without a cause.'<br>

1 We who are strong must be considerate of those who are sensitive about things like this. We must not just please ourselves.<br>

69:1 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.<br>
<br>
(I sink in the mire of depth, where there is no standing: I am come into depth of waters, where the floods overflow me.)<br>
69:2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.<br>
<br>
69:3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail whilst I wait for my God.<br>
69:4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.<br>
<br>
69:5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.<br>
(and my guiltiness is not hid from thee.)<br>
69:6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.<br>
69:7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.<br>
69:8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.<br>
69:9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.<br>
69:10 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.<br>
69:11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.<br>
<br>
69:12 They that sit in the gate speak against me;<br>
and I was the song of the drunkards.<br>
(and I was the song of the drinkers of strong drink.)<br>
69:13 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.<br>
69:14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.<br>
69:15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.<br>
69:16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.<br>
<br>
69:17 And hide not thy face from thy servant;<br>
for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.<br>
(make haste to hear me.)<br>
69:18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.<br>
69:19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.<br>
<br>
69:20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness:<br>
(and I looked for some to lament with me, but there was none;)<br>
and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;<br>
and for comforters, but I found none.<br>
<br>
69:21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<br>
69:22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.<br>
69:23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.<br>
69:24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.<br>
<br>
(Let their palace be desolate; and let there not be a dweller in their tents.)<br>
69:25 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.<br>

<br>
(Add punishment of iniquity:)<br>
69:27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.<br>
<br>
69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.<br>
69:29 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.<br>
69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br>
69:31 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.<br>
(The meek shall see this,)<br>
69:32 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.<br>
69:33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.<br>
<br>
69:34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.<br>
(and every thing that creepeth therein.)<br>

69:35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.<br>

For the choir director:<br>
A psalm of David, to be sung to the tune "Lilies."<br>
<br>
1<br>
Save me, O God,<br>
for the floodwaters are up to my neck.<br>
2<br>
Deeper and deeper I sink into the mire;<br>
I can't find a foothold.<br>
I am in deep water,<br>
and the floods overwhelm me.<br>
<br>
3<br>
I am exhausted from crying for help;<br>
my throat is parched.<br>
My eyes are swollen with weeping,<br>
waiting for my God to help me.<br>
4<br>
Those who hate me without cause<br>
outnumber the hairs on my head.<br>
Many enemies try to destroy me with lies,<br>
demanding that I give back what I didn't steal.<br>
5<br>
O God, you know how foolish I am;<br>
my sins cannot be hidden from you.<br>
6<br>
Don't let those who trust in you be ashamed because of me,<br>
O Sovereign Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
Don't let me cause them to be humiliated,<br>
O God of Israel.<br>
7<br>
For I endure insults for your sake;<br>
humiliation is written all over my face.<br>
8<br>
Even my own brothers pretend they don't know me;<br>
they treat me like a stranger.<br>
9<br>
Passion for your house has consumed me,<br>
and the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.<br>
10<br>
When I weep and fast,<br>
they scoff at me.<br>
11<br>
When I dress in burlap to show sorrow,<br>
they make fun of me.<br>
12<br>
I am the favourite topic of town gossip,<br>
and all the drunks sing about me.<br>
13<br>
But I keep praying to you, Lord,<br>
hoping this time you will show me favour.<br>
In your unfailing love, O God,<br>
answer my prayer with your sure salvation.<br>
14<br>
Rescue me from the mud;<br>
don't let me sink any deeper!<br>
Save me from those who hate me,<br>
and pull me from these deep waters.<br>
15<br>
Don't let the floods overwhelm me,<br>
or the deep waters swallow me,<br>
or the pit of death devour me.<br>
16<br>
Answer my prayers, O Lord,<br>
for your unfailing love is wonderful.<br>
Take care of me,<br>
for your mercy is so plentiful.<br>
17<br>
Don't hide from your servant;<br>
answer me quickly, for I am in deep trouble!<br>
18<br>
Come and redeem me;<br>
free me from my enemies.<br>
19<br>
You know of my shame, scorn, and disgrace.<br>
You see all that my enemies are doing.<br>
20<br>
Their insults have broken my heart,<br>
and I am in despair.<br>
If only one person would show some pity;<br>
if only one would turn and comfort me.<br>
<br>
21<br>
But instead, they give me poison for food;<br>
(they give me gall for food;)<br>
they offer me sour wine for my thirst.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Let their bountiful table set before them become a snare,<br>
a trap that makes them think all is well.<br>
Let their blessings cause them to stumble,<br>
and let them get what they deserve,<br>
and let their backs be bent forever.)<br>
<br>
<br>
22<br>
Let the bountiful table set before them become a snare<br>
and their prosperity become a trap.<br>
23<br>
Let their eyes go blind so they cannot see,<br>
and make their bodies shake continually.<br>
24<br>
Pour out your fury on them;<br>
consume them with your burning anger.<br>
25<br>
Let their homes become desolate<br>
and their tents be deserted.<br>
26<br>
To the one you have punished, they add insult to injury;<br>
they add to the pain of those you have hurt.<br>
27<br>
Pile their sins up high,<br>
and don't let them go free.<br>
28<br>
Erase their names from the Book of Life;<br>
don't let them be counted amongst the righteous.<br>
29<br>
I am suffering and in pain.<br>
Rescue me, O God, by your saving power.<br>
30<br>
Then I will praise God's name with singing,<br>
and I will honour him with thanksgiving.<br>
31<br>
For this will please the Lord more than sacrificing cattle,<br>
more than presenting a bull with its horns and hooves.<br>
32<br>
The humble will see their God at work and be glad.<br>
Let all who seek God's help be encouraged.<br>
33<br>
For the Lord hears the cries of the needy;<br>
he does not despise his imprisoned people.<br>
34<br>
Praise him, O heaven and earth,<br>
the seas and all that move in them.<br>
<br>
(For God will save Zion)<br>
35<br>
For God will save Jerusalem<br>
and rebuild the towns of Judah.<br>
His people will live there<br>
and settle in their own land.<br>
36<br>
The descendants of those who obey him will inherit the land,<br>
and those who love him will live there in safety.<br>

2 I have sunk in deep mud, And there is no place to stand; I have come into deep waters, And the floods overflow me.<br>
<br>
3 I am worn out from my crying; My throat is dry; My eyes grow dim As I wait for my Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem).<br>
4 Those who hate me without a cause Are more than the hairs of my head; They are mighty who would destroy me, My lying enemies; What I did not steal, I restored.<br>
5 O Elohim, You Yourself know my foolishness; And my guilt has not been hidden from You.<br>
6 Let not those who wait for You, O Master Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, Be ashamed because of me; Let not those who seek You Be humbled because of me, O Elohim of Yis-Rye-eLL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL).<br>
7 Because I have borne reproach for Your sake; Shame has covered my face.<br>
8 I have become a stranger to my brothers, And a foreigner to my mother's children;<br>
9 Because ardour for Your house has eaten me up, And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.<br>
10 And I wept in my being with fasting, And it became my reproach.<br>
11 And when I put on sackcloth, I became a proverb to them.<br>
12 They who sit in the gate talk about me, And I am the song of the drunkards.<br>
13 But as for me, my prayer is to You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, At an acceptable time, O Elohim. In the greatness of Your loving-commitment, Answer me in the truth of Your deliverance.<br>
14 Rescue me out of the mire, And let me not sink. Let me be rescued from those who hate me, And out of the deep waters.<br>
15 Let not a flood of waters overflow me, Nor let the deep swallow me up, Nor let the pit shut its mouth on me.<br>
16 Answer me, O Yaw-Who-Wah, for Your loving-commitment is good. According to the greatness of Your compassion, turn to me.<br>
17 And do not hide Your face from Your servant, For I am in distress; Answer me speedily.<br>
18 Draw near to my being, redeem it; Ransom me because of my enemies.<br>
19 You Yourself know my reproach, And my shame and my confusion; My adversaries are all before You.<br>
20 Reproach has broken my heart and I am sick; I looked for sympathy, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.<br>
<br>
21 And they gave me gall for my food, And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<br>
22 Let their table before them become a snare, And a trap to those at ease.<br>
23 Let their eyes be darkened, so as not to see; And make their loins shake continually.<br>
24 Pour out Your wrath upon them, And let Your burning displeasure overtake them.<br>
25 Let their encampments be deserted; Let no one dwell in their tents.<br>
26 For they persecute him whom You have stricken, And talk about the pain of those You have wounded.<br>
27 Add crookedness to their crookedness, And let them not enter into Your righteousness.<br>
28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, And not be written with the righteous.<br>
29 But I am poor and in pain; Let Your deliverance, O Elohim, set me up on high.<br>
30 I praise the Name of Elohim with a song, And I make Him great with thanksgiving.<br>
31 And this pleases Yaw-Who-Wah more than an ox, A bull with horns and hooves.<br>
32 The humble shall see, they rejoice, You who seek Elohim, and your hearts live.<br>
33 For Yaw-Who-Wah hears the poor, And He shall not despise His captives.<br>
34 Let the heavens and earth praise Him, The seas and all that moves in them.<br>
35 For Elohim shall save Tsiyon And build the cities of Yeh-Who-Duh (Judah). And they shall dwell there and possess it,<br>
36 And the seed of His servants inherit it, And those who love His Name dwell in it.<br>

The Hebrew word, Belial, means, without profit, worthlessness, destruction, wickedness, evil, naughty, ungodly (people), wicked.<br>
<br>
Psalms 101, verses 3 and 4 -- KJV<br>
3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes (I will set no thing of Belial before mine eyes): I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.<br>
4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In Jubilees Chapter 1, the "spirit of Beliar" represents a force of wickedness and rebellion against God, embodying deception, moral corruption, and opposition to divine will.<br>
Beliar is linked to the forces of evil that lead humanity astray, influencing disobedience and idolatry.<br>
The term emphasises wickedness and harmful intent. It reflects the broader theme of spiritual warfare in the text, where Beliar's spirit contrasts with faithfulness to God and His covenant.<br>
<br>
Beliar and Belial both signify opposition to God and embody forces of evil. Beliar, primarily from Jubilees, represents wickedness, deception, and rebellion as a spiritual entity leading humanity astray. Belial, a Hebrew term found in the Bible, means "worthless" or "lawless" and often refers to individuals or forces embodying moral corruption and rebellion against God.<br>
<br>
Whilst both share themes of wickedness and lawlessness, Beliar is more explicitly tied to cosmic or demonic forces, whereas Belial often describes moral depravity or worthlessness in human actions. The two overlap in essence but differ in scope and usage.<br>

Jubilees Chapter 1 -- All of Chapter 1, All 24 verses -- George Henry Schodde 1888 English Translation<br>
<br>
1 And it happened in the first year of the exodus of the children of Israel out of Egypt, in the 3rd month, on the 16th of this month, and the Lord spoke to Moses saying: "Ascend to me here on the mountain, and I will give to thee the two stone tablets of the law and the commandments; as I have written them, thou shalt make them known."<br>
2 And Moses ascended the mountain of the Lord, and the glory of the Lord dwelt on the mountain of Sinai, and a cloud overshadowed it six days.<br>
3 And the Lord called to Moses on the seventh day in the midst of the cloud; and he saw the glory of the Lord like a flaming fire on the top of the mountain.<br>
4 And Moses was there on the mountain forty days and forty nights, and the Lord instructed him in regard to what was past and what would be, the words of the division of days, both in the law and the testimony.<br>
5 And he said to him: "Incline thy heart to every word which I shall speak to thee, and write them into a book, in order that their generations may see how I have left them on account of all the evil which they do, in rebelling and in deserting the covenant which I established between me and thee this day on Mount Sinai for their generations.<br>
6 And it will be and these words shall declare it thus when all the punishments shall come over them, and they will know that I am more righteous than they in all their judgements and their desires, and they will know that I was with them.<br>
7 And thou, write for thyself all these words which I make known to thee this day (for I know their rebellion and their stiff neck) before I shall lead them into the land which I have sworn to their fathers, to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob, saying, "To your seed I will give this land, which flows with milk and honey; and they shall eat and be satisfied.<br>
8 And they will turn themselves to false gods, who did not deliver them from all their oppression; and this testimony will be heard against them for a testimony.<br>
9 For they will forget all my ordinances which I have commanded them, and will walk after the gentiles and after their impurity and after their shame, and will serve their gods, and these will become for them an offence unto oppression and misfortune and for a trap.<br>
10 And many will be destroyed and will be taken captive and will fall into the hands of the enemy, because they have deserted my ordinances and my commands and the festivals of my covenant, and my sabbaths and that which I have sanctified to myself in their midst, and my tabernacle and my sanctuary which I have sanctified to myself in the midst of the land that I should set my name over it and it should dwell there.<br>
11 And they will make to themselves altars on heights and groves and sculptured idols, and each one will worship his own idol for sin, and they will offer their children to the demons and to all the deeds of the error of their hearts.<br>
12 And I will send witnesses to them that I may testify over them, but they will not hear and will slay my witnesses, and they will cast out those who seek the law, and will abolish the whole [law], and will begin to do evil before my eyes.<br>
13 And I will hide my face from them and I will deliver them over to the gentiles for captivity and for binding and for devouring and for expelling them from the midst of the land, and I shall scatter them in the midst of the gentiles.<br>
14 And they will forget all my law and all my commandments and all my judgement, and they will err in reference to new moons and sabbaths and festivals and jubilees and ordinances.<br>
15 And then they will turn themselves to me from the midst of the gentiles with all their hearts and all their soul and all their power, and I shall gather them from amongst all the gentiles, and they will seek me that I may be found for them when they seek me with all their heart and with all their soul, and I will open to them much peace and righteousness.<br>
16 And I will transplant them as a plant of righteousness, with all my heart and with all my soul, and they will be to me for a blessing and not for a curse, a head and not, a tail; and I will build up my sanctuary in their midst, and I will dwell with them, and I will be to them their God, and they shall be to me my people, in truth and in righteousness, and I will not desert them and will not deny them, for I am the Lord their God."<br>
17 And Moses fell down upon his face, and he prayed and said: "My Lord and my God, do not forsake thy people and thy inheritance to wander in the error of their hearts, and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies, the gentiles, that these may not rule over them, and that they do not make them to sin against thee.<br>
18 O Lord, let thy mercy be raised over thy people, and create for them a righteous mind, and let not the spirit of Beliar rule over them to accuse them before thee, to entrap them away from the path of righteousness, that they be destroyed from before thy face.<br>
19 But they are thy people and thy inheritance, which thou hast delivered from the hands of the Egyptians with thy great power; and create in them a clean heart and a holy spirit, and let them not be entrapped in their sins from now on and to eternity!"<br>
20 And the Lord said to Moses: "I know their contrariness and their thoughts and their stiff neck, and they will not obey until they learn their sins and the sins of their fathers. And after this they will turn to me in all righteousness and with their whole heart and with their whole soul, and I will circumcise the foreskin of their hearts and the foreskin of the hearts of their seed, and I will create for them a holy spirit, and will cleanse them so that they do not turn away from me from this day to eternity.<br>
21 And their souls will cling to me and to all my commandments, and my commandments shall return to them, and I will be to them a father, and they shall be to me children. And they shall all be called the children of the living God, and will know all things of the spirit and all things of service, and it will be known that they are my children and that I am their father in righteousness and in truth, and that I love them.<br>
22 And thou, write down for thyself all these words which I have this day made known to thee on this mountain, the first and the last and what is future, according to all the division of days in the law and in the testimony, and according to the weeks of the jubilees to eternity, until I descend and dwell with them in all eternity."<br>
23 And he said to the angel of the face: "Write for Moses from the beginning of creation until my sanctuary shall have been established in their midst for all eternity, and the Lord will have appeared to the eyes of all, and all will know that I am the God of Israel and the Father of all of the children of Jacob and King on Mount Zion from eternity to eternity. And Zion and Jerusalem will be holy."<br>
24 And the angel of the face, who went before the tents of Israel, took the tablets of the division of years from the time of the creation, the law and the testimony for the weeks and the jubilees, each year according to all its numbers and the jubilees according to years from the day of the new creation, when heaven and earth were created new, and also all creation according to the powers of heaven and all the creation of the earth, until then when the sanctuary of the Lord will be made in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, and all the luminaries will be renewed for a healing and for peace and for a blessing for all the chosen of Israel, that it may be thus from this day on and to all the days of the world!<br>

Commentary:<br>
The numbering of the chapter verses is different in the English translations.<br>
Chapter 1 was made to have 24 verses in the George Henry Schodde translation.<br>
In the next English translation, R.H. (Robert Henry) Charles decided to<br>
take the same Chapter 1 and have it be numbered with 28 verses.<br>
<br>
The phrase "[2450 Anno Mundi]" in Jubilees 1:1, as translated by R.H. Charles, refers to the year 2450 in the Anno Mundi ("Year of the World") system, which counts years from the creation of the world according to biblical chronology.<br>
This dating method is used in some Jewish traditions and ancient texts to provide a timeline of events based on a literal interpretation of the Bible.<br>
Thus, 2450 AM places the events of Jubilees 1:1 within that framework, aligning with the biblical narrative.<br>
<br>
Converting 2450 Anno Mundi to today's common and popular Gregorian calendar depends on the specific chronology used to date the creation.<br>
In most Jewish traditions, creation is placed at 3761 BC.<br>
Adding 2450 years places the event of Jubilees 1:1 in 1311 BC.<br>
However, variations in biblical interpretations and calendar systems can yield different results.<br>
Absolute conversion remains uncertain due to discrepancies between Anno Mundi calculations and historical dating methods.<br>

Jubilees Chapter 1 -- All of Chapter 1, All 28 verses --<br>
R.H. (Robert Henry) Charles English Translation (1895, 1902, 1913, 1917)<br>
<br>
1 And it came to pass in the first year of the exodus of the children of Israel out of Egypt, in the third month, on the sixteenth day of the month, [2450 Anno Mundi] that God spake to Moses, saying: 'Come up to Me on the Mount, and I will give thee two tables of stone of the law and of the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayst teach them.'<br>
2 And Moses went up into the mount of God, and the glory of the Lord abode on Mount Sinai, and a cloud overshadowed it six days.<br>
3 And He called to Moses on the seventh day out of the midst of the cloud, and the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a flaming fire on the top of the mount.<br>
4 And Moses was on the Mount forty days and forty nights, and God taught him the earlier and the later history of the division of all the days of the law and of the testimony.<br>
5 And He said: 'Incline thine heart to every word which I shall speak to thee on this mount, and write them in a book in order that their generations may see how I have not forsaken them for all the evil which they have wrought in transgressing the covenant which I establish between Me and thee for their generations this day on Mount Sinai.<br>
6 And thus it will come to pass when all these things come upon them, that they will recognise that I am more righteous than they in all their judgements and in all their actions, and they will recognise that I have been truly with them.<br>
7 And do thou write for thyself all these words which I declare unto, thee this day, for I know their rebellion and their stiff neck, before I bring them into the land of which I sware to their fathers, to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob, saying: ' Unto your seed will I give a land flowing with milk and honey.<br>
8 And they will eat and be satisfied, and they will turn to strange gods, to (gods) which cannot deliver them from aught of their tribulation: and this witness shall be heard for a witness against them. For they will forget all My commandments, (even) all that I command them, and they will walk after the Gentiles, and after their uncleanness, and after their shame, and will serve their gods, and these will prove unto them an offence and a tribulation and an affliction and a snare.<br>
9 And many will perish and they will be taken captive, and will fall into the hands of the enemy, because they have forsaken My ordinances and My commandments, and the festivals of My covenant, and My sabbaths, and My holy place which I have hallowed for Myself in their midst, and My tabernacle, and My sanctuary, which I have hallowed for Myself in the midst of the land, that I should set my name upon it, and that it should dwell (there).<br>
10 And they will make to themselves high places and groves and graven images, and they will worship, each his own (graven image), so as to go astray, and they will sacrifice their children to demons, and to all the works of the error of their hearts.<br>
11 And I will send witnesses unto them, that I may witness against them, but they will not hear, and will slay the witnesses also, and they will persecute those who seek the law, and they will abrogate and change everything so as to work evil before My eyes.<br>
12 And I will hide My face from them, and I will deliver them into the hand of the Gentiles for captivity, and for a prey, and for devouring, and I will remove them from the midst of the land, and I will scatter them amongst the Gentiles.<br>
13 And they will forget all My law and all My commandments and all My judgements, and will go astray as to new moons, and sabbaths, and festivals, and jubilees, and ordinances.<br>
14 And after this they will turn to Me from amongst the Gentiles with all their heart and with all their soul and with all their strength, and I will gather them from amongst all the Gentiles, and they will seek me, so that I shall be found of them, when they seek me with all their heart and with all their soul.<br>
15 And I will disclose to them abounding peace with righteousness, and I will remove them the plant of uprightness, with all My heart and with all My soul, and they shall be for a blessing and not for a curse, and they shall be the head and not the tail.<br>
16 And I will build My sanctuary in their midst, and I will dwell with them, and I will be their God and they shall be My people in truth and righteousness.<br>
17 And I will not forsake them nor fail them; for I am the Lord their God.'<br>
18 And Moses fell on his face and prayed and said, 'O Lord my God, do not forsake Thy people and Thy inheritance, so that they should wander in the error of their hearts, and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies, the Gentiles, lest they should rule over them and cause them to sin against Thee.<br>
19 Let thy mercy, O Lord, be lifted up upon Thy people, and create in them an upright spirit, and let not the spirit of Beliar rule over them to accuse them before Thee, and to ensnare them from all the paths of righteousness, so that they may perish from before Thy face.<br>
20 But they are Thy people and Thy inheritance, which thou hast delivered with thy great power from the hands of the Egyptians: create in them a clean heart and a holy spirit, and let them not be ensnared in their sins from henceforth until eternity.'<br>
21 And the Lord said unto Moses: 'I know their contrariness and their thoughts and their stiffneckedness, and they will not be obedient till they confess their own sin and the sin of their fathers.<br>
22 And after this they will turn to Me in all uprightness and with all (their) heart and with all (their) soul, and I will circumcise the foreskin of their heart and the foreskin of the heart of their seed, and I will create in them a holy spirit, and I will cleanse them so that they shall not turn away from Me from that day unto eternity.<br>
23 And their souls will cleave to Me and to all My commandments, and they will fulfil My commandments, and I will be their Father and they shall be My children.<br>
24 And they all shall be called children of the living God, and every angel and every spirit shall know, yea, they shall know that these are My children, and that I am their Father in uprightness and righteousness, and that I love them.<br>
25 And do thou write down for thyself all these words which I declare unto thee on this mountain, the first and the last, which shall come to pass in all the divisions of the days in the law and in the testimony and in the weeks and the jubilees unto eternity, until I descend and dwell with them throughout eternity.'<br>
26 And He said to the angel of the presence: Write for Moses from the beginning of creation till My sanctuary has been built among them for all eternity.<br>
27 And the Lord will appear to the eyes of all, and all shall know that I am the God of Israel and the Father of all the children of Jacob, and King on Mount Zion for all eternity. And Zion and Jerusalem shall be holy.'<br>
28 And the angel of the presence who went before the camp of Israel took the tables of the divisions of the years -from the time of the creation- of the law and of the testimony of the weeks of the jubilees, according to the individual years, according to all the number of the jubilees [according, to the individual years], from the day of the [new] creation when the heavens and the earth shall be renewed and all their creation according to the powers of the heaven, and according to all the creation of the earth, until the sanctuary of the Lord shall be made in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, and all the luminaries be renewed for healing and for peace and for blessing for all the elect of Israel, and that thus it may be from that day and unto all the days of the earth.<br>

Psalms 110:1 -- KJV<br>
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 110:1 -- NLT<br>
The Lord said to my Lord,<br>
"Sit in the place of honour at my right hand<br>
until I humble your enemies,<br>
making them a footstool under your feet."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If Father God is Yaw-Who-Wah, and his son is the Master Yaw-Who-Shaw, Psalms 110:1 makes more sense when you see what is actually going on the Hebrew.<br>
The first word, Lord, is the name of Yaw-Who-Wah, and the second Lord name is the Hebrew word, Ah-Doan, which is singular, and there is also Ah-Doe-Nye which is the plural form, which means, Master, husband, king.<br>
In the KJV, the first Lord would be in all uppercase letters and the second Lord is not.<br>
The TS2009 sees this difference between these two different Hebrew words, and does a better job translating Psalms 110:1.<br>
The Father is telling His son, our Master, to "Sit at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."<br>
This is where our Messiah is, seated at the right hand of ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 110:1 -- TS2009<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah said to my Master, "Sit at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."<br>

Colossians 2:20, and we keep reading into the next chapter,<br>
stopping at Colossians 3:4 -- KJV<br>
2:20 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,<br>
2:21 (Touch not; taste not; handle not;<br>
2:22 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?<br>
2:23 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.<br>
3:1 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<br>
3:2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.<br>
3:3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<br>
3:4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 2:20, and we keep reading into the next chapter,<br>
stopping at Colossians 3:4 -- NLT<br>
20 You have died with Christ, and he has set you free from the spiritual powers of this world. So why do you keep on following the rules of the world, such as,<br>
21 "Don't handle! Don't taste! Don't touch!"?<br>
22 Such rules are mere human teachings about things that deteriorate as we use them.<br>
23 These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion, pious self-denial, and severe bodily discipline. But they provide no help in conquering a person's evil desires.<br>
1 Since you have been raised to new life with Christ, set your sights on the realities of heaven, where Christ sits in the place of honour at God's right hand.<br>
2 Think about the things of heaven, not the things of earth.<br>
3 For you died to this life, and your real life is hidden with Christ in God.<br>
(And when Christ, who is our life,)<br>
4 And when Christ, who is your life, is revealed to the whole world, you will share in all his glory.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 2:20, and we keep reading into the next chapter,<br>
stopping at Colossians 3:4 -- TS2009<br>
<br>
20 If, then, you died with Messiah from the elementary matters of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to dogmas:<br>
21 "Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle" --<br>
22 which are all to perish with use -- according to the commands and teachings of men?<br>
23 These indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed worship, humiliation and harsh treatment of the body -- of no value at all, only for satisfaction of the flesh.<br>
1 If, then, you were raised with Messiah, seek the matters which are above, where Messiah is, seated at the right hand of Elohim.<br>
2 Mind the matters above, not those on the earth.<br>
3 For you have died, and your life has been hidden with Messiah in Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem).<br>
4 When the Messiah, who is our life, is manifested, then you also shall be manifested with Him in esteem.<br>

<br>
In January of 2025, I was remembering my family and my marriage that I have joyfully had for over 25 years.<br>
The Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, through His Son, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck has shown us His love, His mercy and His grace,<br>
time and time again, through all of these years, many of which seemed difficult, and yet, His blessing never stopped.<br>
I could type a million paragraphs about how He has loved us during this past quarter of a century, and still not adequately communicate<br>
the richness of His blessing and His love from Him, and from and through my family.<br>
<br>
One of the best and strongest times of enjoying Him, being in a good church, and being blessed to be around his beautiful people,<br>
was a season for us that was from 2006 to 2012 in Southern Oregon.<br>
<br>
Thirteen miles south west of downtown Medford, Oregon is the small community of Ruch, Oregon.<br>
The town's name was spelled, R U C H, but it was pronounced, Roo-Sh.<br>
It was there that my family enjoyed the services of a megachurch known as Applegate Christian Fellowship (ACF) from 2006 to 2012.
<br>
Even as we carry on in this year of 2025, we still continue to choose, time and time again, the recordings of the praise and worship songs<br>
that were produced and released by the musicians of Applegate Christian Fellowship from 2008 through 2011.<br>
<br>
We were very blessed by the services and musical performances of that time. There were good teachings by pastor Jon Courson<br>
and his son, Ben Courson, and occasionally from Jon's older son, Peter-John Courson.<br>
<br>
The pastors and the musicians of that time have all left and have moved on, and so have we, but the beautiful fellowship of real friends, loving families,<br>
and the sprit-filled concerts and sermons, is something we have never quite been able to experience so deeply and powerfully as it was back then.<br>
<br>
My expectation of it being that good again, and even better than that, will be in the Kingdom of Heaven, forever.<br>
<br>
Some of those musicians of Applegate Christian Fellowship at that time were previously part of a band, called, Seven Places.<br>
<br>
Seven Places was a Christian rock band founded in the year 2000.<br>
The group disbanded in 2005 to pursue other projects.<br>
Their last album that was under the name of Seven Places,<br>
was titled, Glowing, and was released on 26 June 2007.<br>
After 2007, some of the members of Seven Places wrote and performed<br>
music for Applegate Christian Fellowship in Southern Oregon.<br>
<br>
They released three albums, under the name of Applegate Christian Fellowship.<br>
<br>
The three albums that they had released were...<br>
The Psalms Project in 2008.<br>
The Psalms Revisited (EP) (Volume 2) in 2010, and<br>
The Psalms Project, Volume 3 in 2011.<br>
<br>
<br>
Applegate Christian Fellowship<br>
included former band members from Seven Places, and<br>
featured performances by<br>
Seth Gilbert, Christy Gilbert,<br>
Demian Norvell, Carrie Miller,<br>
Justin Zigenis, Matthew Zigenis, Andy Pallotta,<br>
Kat Walker and Matt Hamilton.<br>
<br>
Matthew Zigenis took over as lead singer during Seth Gilbert's absence<br>
in 2008, 2009 and in 2012.<br>
<br>
Matthew Zigenis and fellow musician Bill ("Billy") Beckman<br>
were last seen in January of 2025 doing<br>
home renovation and remodelling work in Portland, Oregon.<br>
<br>
I wanted to share with you the words to five of their songs from their<br>
2008 album, The Psalms Project.<br>
<br>
Seth Gilbert did the lead vocals during the album's production in 2008,<br>
and then brothers Justin Zigenis and Matthew Zigenis did the lead vocals<br>
during Seth Gilbert's absence in 2008, 2009 and 2012.<br>
<br>
Again, all five of these songs all come from their 2008 album, The Psalms Project.<br>

2<br>
I will praise the Lord as long as I live.<br>
I will sing praises to my God with my dying breath.<br>
3<br>
Don't put your confidence in powerful people;<br>
there is no help for you there.<br>
4<br>
When they breathe their last, they return to the earth,<br>
and all their plans die with them.<br>
5<br>
(But joyful are those who have the God of Jacob as their helper,)<br>
But joyful are those who have the God of Israel as their helper,<br>
whose hope is in the Lord their God.<br>
6<br>
He made heaven and earth,<br>
the sea, and everything in them.<br>
He keeps every promise forever.<br>
7<br>
He gives justice to the oppressed<br>
and food to the hungry.<br>
The Lord frees the prisoners.<br>
8<br>
The Lord opens the eyes of the blind.<br>
The Lord lifts up those who are weighed down.<br>
The Lord loves the godly.<br>

The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind<br>

Psalms 86, all of Psalms 86, all 17 verses -- KJV<br>
86:1 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.<br>
86:2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy:<br>
(Preserve my soul; for I am one whom thou favourest:)<br>
O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.<br>
86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.<br>
(Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee all the day.)<br>
86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.<br>
86:5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.<br>
86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.<br>
86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.<br>
86:8 Amongst the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.<br>
86:9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.<br>
86:10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.<br>
86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.<br>
86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.<br>
86:13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.<br>
(from the lowest grave)<br>
86:14 O God, the proud are risen against me,<br>
and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul;<br>
(and the assemblies of terrible men have sought after my soul;)<br>
and have not set thee before them.<br>
86:15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.<br>
86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.<br>
86:17 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.<br>

Psalms 86, all of Psalms 86, all 17 verses -- NLT<br>
A prayer of David.<br>
1<br>
Bend down, O Lord, and hear my prayer;<br>
answer me, for I need your help.<br>
2<br>
Protect me, for I am devoted to you.<br>
Save me, for I serve you and trust you.<br>
You are my God.<br>
3<br>
Be merciful to me, O Lord,<br>
for I am calling on you constantly.<br>
4<br>
Give me happiness, O Lord,<br>
for I give myself to you.<br>
5<br>
O Lord, you are so good, so ready to forgive,<br>
so full of unfailing love for all who ask for your help.<br>
6<br>
Listen closely to my prayer, O Lord;<br>
hear my urgent cry.<br>
7<br>
I will call to you whenever I'm in trouble,<br>
and you will answer me.<br>
8<br>
No pagan god is like you, O Lord.<br>
None can do what you do!<br>
9<br>
All the nations you made<br>
will come and bow before you, Lord;<br>
they will praise your holy name.<br>
10<br>
For you are great and perform wonderful deeds.<br>
You alone are God.<br>
11<br>
Teach me your ways, O Lord,<br>
that I may live according to your truth!<br>
Grant me purity of heart,<br>
so that I may honour you.<br>
12<br>
With all my heart I will praise you, O Lord my God.<br>
I will give glory to your name forever,<br>
13<br>
for your love for me is very great.<br>
You have rescued me from the depths of death.<br>
(You have rescued me from the depths of Sheol.)<br>
14<br>
O God, insolent people rise up against me;<br>
a violent gang is trying to kill me.<br>
You mean nothing to them.<br>
15<br>
But you, O Lord,<br>
are a God of compassion and mercy,<br>
slow to get angry<br>
and filled with unfailing love and faithfulness.<br>
16<br>
Look down and have mercy on me.<br>
Give your strength to your servant;<br>
save me, the son of your servant.<br>
17<br>
Send me a sign of your favour.<br>
Then those who hate me will be put to shame,<br>
for you, O Lord, help and comfort me.<br>
<br>

Psalms 86, all of Psalms 86, all 17 verses -- TS2009<br>
1 Incline Your ear, O Yaw-Who-Wah, Answer me, for I am poor and needy.<br>
2 Guard my being, for I am lovingly-committed; You are my Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem); Save Your servant who is trusting in You!<br>
3 Show favour to me, O Yaw-Who-Wah, For I cry to You all day long.<br>
4 Bring joy to the being of Your servant, For to You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, I lift up my being.<br>
5 For You, Yaw-Who-Wah, are good, and ready to forgive, And great in loving-commitment to all those who call upon You.<br>
6 Give ear, O Yaw-Who-Wah, to my prayer; And listen to the voice of my pleadings.<br>
7 In the day of my distress I call upon You, For You answer me.<br>
8 There is none like You amongst the mighty ones, O Yaw-Who-Wah; And like Your works there are none.<br>
9 Let all nations You have made Come and bow themselves before You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, And give esteem to Your Name.<br>
10 For You are great, and are doing wonders; You are Elohim, You alone.<br>
11 Teach me Your way, O Yaw-Who-Wah; Let me walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your Name.<br>
12 I praise You, O Yaw-Who-Wah my Elohim, with all my heart, And I esteem Your Name forever.<br>
13 For Your loving-commitment is great toward me, And You have delivered my being From the depths of She'ol.<br>
14 O Elohim, the proud have risen against me, And a band of dreaded men have sought my life, And have not set You before them.<br>
15 But You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, Are a compassionate ELL-Low-Heem and showing favour, Patient and great in loving-commitment and truth.<br>
16 Turn to me, and show favour to me! Give Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your female servant.<br>
17 Show me a sign for good, And let those hating me see it and be ashamed, For You, Yaw-Who-Wah, have helped me and comforted me.<br>

Next, we will read about Paul telling us about his Hardships.<br>
<br>
<br>
We will now start reading the last two verses of<br>
2 Corinthians 5, starting at<br>
2 Corinthians 5:20<br>
and we keep on reading into the next chapter,<br>
stopping when we get to<br>
2 Corinthians 6:10 -- TS2009<br>
20 Therefore we are envoys on behalf of Messiah, as though Elohim were pleading through us. We beg, on behalf of Messiah: Be restored to favour with Elohim.<br>
21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of Elohim.<br>
1 And working together, we also call upon you not to receive the favour of Elohim in vain --<br>
2 For He says, "In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in a day of deliverance I have helped you." See, now is the well-accepted time, see, now is a day of deliverance --<br>
3 giving no cause of stumbling in whatever, so that the service is not blamed.<br>
4 Rather, we commend ourselves as servants of Elohim in every way: in much endurance, in pressures, in hardships, in distresses,<br>
5 in stripes, in imprisonments, in disturbances, in toils, in watchings, in fastings,<br>
6 in cleanness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, (by the Roo-Awk Haw-Coh-Desh) in the Set-apart Spirit, in love unfeigned,<br>
7 in the word of truth, in the power of Elohim, through the weapons of righteousness, on the right and on the left,<br>
8 through esteem and disrespect, through evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers, and yet true;<br>
9 as unknown, and yet well-known; as dying, and see, we live; as disciplined, and yet not killed;<br>
10 as sad, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having none, and yet possessing all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We will now start reading again the last two verses of<br>
2 Corinthians 5, starting at<br>
2 Corinthians 5:20<br>
and we keep on reading into the next chapter,<br>
stopping when we get to<br>
2 Corinthians 6:10 -- NLT<br>
20 So we are Christ's ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us. We speak for Christ when we plead, "Come back to God!"<br>
21 For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin,<br>
(For God made Christ, who never sinned, to become sin itself,)<br>
so that we could be made right with God through Christ.<br>
(As we work together,)<br>
1 As God's partners, we beg you not to accept this marvellous gift of God's kindness and then ignore it.<br>
(In the Greek Version of Isaiah 49:8, it says this...)<br>
2<br>
For God says,<br>
"At just the right time, I heard you.<br>
On the day of salvation, I helped you."<br>
Indeed, the "right time" is now. Today is the day of salvation.<br>
3 We live in such a way that no one will stumble because of us, and no one will find fault with our ministry.<br>
4 In everything we do, we show that we are true ministers of God. We patiently endure troubles and hardships and calamities of every kind.<br>
5 We have been beaten, been put in prison, faced angry mobs, worked to exhaustion, endured sleepless nights, and gone without food.<br>
6 We prove ourselves by our purity, our understanding, our patience, our kindness,<br>
(by our holiness of spirit, by the Roo-Awk Haw-Coh-Desh)<br>
by the Holy Spirit within us, and by our sincere love.<br>
7 We faithfully preach the truth. God's power is working in us. We use the weapons of righteousness in the right hand for attack and the left hand for defence.<br>
8 We serve God whether people honour us or despise us, whether they slander us or praise us. We are honest, but they call us impostors.<br>
9 We are ignored, even though we are well known. We live close to death, but we are still alive. We have been beaten, but we have not been killed.<br>
10 Our hearts ache, but we always have joy. We are poor, but we give spiritual riches to others. We own nothing, and yet we have everything.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That was mainly in 2 Corinthians, Chapter 6.<br>
Later on, when we get to Chapter 11, Paul talks again about his Hardships and Many Trials.<br>
He repeats some of the things that we have just now looked at in Chapter 6, and he gives some additional details about some other things in Chapter 11.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 11: 22-29 -- TS2009<br>
22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they of Yis-Rye-eLL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL)? So am I. Are they the seed of Ah-Vrah-Hom? So am I.<br>
23 Are they servants of Messiah? -- I speak as beside myself -- I am more, in labours much more, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths many times.<br>
24 Five times I received from (the Jewish leaders) the Yeh-Who-Deem forty stripes less one.<br>
25 Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have been in the deep,<br>
26 in many travels, in dangers of waters, in dangers of robbers, in dangers from my own race, in dangers from the nations, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the desert, in dangers in the sea, in dangers amongst false brothers;<br>
27 in toil and hardship, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness,<br>
28 besides the matters from outside, what comes upon me daily: the anxiety for all the assemblies.<br>
29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn inwardly?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 11: 22-29 -- NLT<br>
22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.<br>
23 Are they servants of Christ? I know I sound like a madman, but I have served him far more! I have worked harder, been put in prison more often, been whipped times without number, and faced death again and again.<br>
24 Five different times the Jewish leaders gave me thirty-nine lashes.<br>
25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. Once I spent a whole night and a day adrift at sea.<br>
26 I have travelled on many long journeys. I have faced danger from rivers and from robbers. I have faced danger from my own people, the Jews, as well as from the Gentiles. I have faced danger in the cities, in the deserts, and on the seas.<br>
(And I have faced danger from false brothers.)<br>
And I have faced danger from men who claim to be believers but are not.<br>
<br>
27 I have worked hard and long, enduring many sleepless nights. I have been hungry and thirsty and have often gone without food. I have shivered in the cold, without enough clothing to keep me warm.<br>
28 Then, besides all this, I have the daily burden of my concern for all the churches.<br>
29 Who is weak without my feeling that weakness? Who is led astray, and I do not burn with anger?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 3: 7-10 (KJV)<br>
3:7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.<br>
3:8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,<br>
3:9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:<br>
3:10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 3: 7-10 -- TS2009<br>
7 But what might have been a gain to me, I have counted as loss, because of Messiah.<br>
8 What is more, I even count all to be loss because of the excellence of the knowledge of Messiah Yaw-Who-Shaw my Master, for whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them as refuse, in order to gain Messiah,<br>
9 and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through belief in Messiah, the righteousness which is from ELL-Low-Heem on the basis of belief,<br>
10 to know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 3: 5-16 -- NLT<br>
5 I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I am a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjamin -- a real Hebrew if there ever was one! I was a member of the Pharisees, who demand the strictest obedience to the Jewish law.<br>
6 I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church. And as for righteousness, I obeyed the law without fault.<br>
7 I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done.<br>
8 Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ<br>
9 and become one with him. I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law; rather,<br>
I become righteous through faith in Christ.<br>
(I become righteous through the faithfulness of Christ.)<br>
For God's way of making us right with himself depends on faith.<br>
<br>
10 I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead. I want to suffer with him, sharing in his death,<br>
11 so that one way or another I will experience the resurrection from the dead!<br>
12 I don't mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me.<br>
13 No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it,<br>
(I have not yet achieved it,)<br>
but I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead,<br>
14 I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us.<br>
15 Let all who are spiritually mature agree on these things. If you disagree on some point, I believe God will make it plain to you.<br>
16 But we must hold on to the progress we have already made.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Right now, we pray to the most high God, the Lord, the Master, ELL-ELLE-ON, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat,<br>
and His only begotten son, the son of ELL-ELLE-ON, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck,<br>
that you, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out of myself, my family, my marriage, and my home,<br>
and the immediate surroundings of where we are and where we live, all days, all hours, and all locations,<br>
rebuke and cast out and protect us<br>
against principalities, against evil, dark powers,<br>
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,<br>
against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>
against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world,<br>
against mighty powers in this dark world,<br>
and against evil spirits in the heavenly places,<br>
against demons of the night,<br>
and things that cause depression, terror, anger, fear and torment<br>
and from demons of the noon and of the morning,<br>
and from malignant spirits arid phantoms.<br>
rebuke and cast out and protect us against<br>
evil, unclean spirits<br>
phantoms, devils, demons, offspring of the fallen watchers,<br>
all satanic people that travel about without a body,<br>
against satan, all of satan's followers, all satanic people,<br>
all anti-christs, all false prophets, the beast and his followers,<br>
all genetically defiled and genetically-modified creatures,<br>
including all genetically defiled and genetically-modified humans,<br>
<br>
rebuke and cast out and protect us against<br>
all wolves pretending to be sheep,<br>
and all evil, satanic portals and gateways.<br>
if a portal or gateway opens up anywhere, in any room inside our home,<br>
and if that portal or gateway is not an officially-approved, authorised, holy operation of ELL-ELLE-ON, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat,<br>
that Heaven's Holy Angel Army personnel would instantly detect and force such a portal or gateway to instantly close,<br>
without any hesitation or delay,<br>
and refuse and stop all that would attempt to look through or travel through<br>
and that the ones who caused the portal or gateway to be opened, would have all such power and ability be taken away from them,<br>
and that all of their powers and authorities would be permanently removed and disabled, to never again be able to do that,<br>
and that all wrongful, evil, unclean relationships, attachments, soul-ties, and relationship connections of any kind be<br>
completely amputated and divorced and severed completely<br>
including all magic spells, hexes, curses, or any other witchcraft attack, satanic attack or magic attack,<br>
would be completely neutralised, deactivated and made of no effect<br>
upon ourselves, our family, our health, and our home.<br>
Forgive us for having any evil, unclean relationship with any person or fellowship or church or congregation, and heal us from all harms, damages, injuries and curses<br>
that were inflicted upon this family that were caused by such present or past relationship attempts.<br>
that Heaven's Holy Angel Army personnel<br>
would continually enforce an impenetrable parameter of protection, safety and security,<br>
from all such kinds of evil, unclean spiritual entities, as we travel, and where we go, where we fellowship, where we live and where we sleep.<br>
<br>
protect us from all actual or perceived uncertainties, insecurities and instabilities,<br>
protect us from all sides, within, and without, protect us from all evil, satanic attacks that may attempt to be invoked spiritually, physically, technologically (using technology as a weapon against us), electronically, magically, pharmaceutically,<br>
coming from above, below, within, without, in front, in back, left, right, north, south, east and west, protect us in all rooms, all vehicles, from all objects and instruments, and protect us in all relationships, encounters, contacts and connections.<br>
<br>
In the name of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, Ah-Main.<br>
<br>

Commentary:<br>
Are you aware of all of the many kinds of satanic rituals that try to strengthen and prolong ageing abominably and scornfully before the Lord?<br>
The Lord Yaw-Who-Wah will rescue his elect ones from every wicked work, every evil work and every evil attack,<br>
and He will preserve them and bring them safely into his heavenly Kingdom.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jasher 18:11 -- 1887 English Translation by J.H. Parry and Company<br>
11 In those days all the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and of the whole five cities, were exceedingly wicked and sinful against the Lord and they provoked the Lord with their abominations, and they strengthened in ageing abominably and scornfully before the Lord, and their wickedness and crimes were in those days great before the Lord.<br>
