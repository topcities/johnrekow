Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

Hebrews 12: 18-25 -- KJV<br>
12:18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,<br>
12:19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:<br>
12:20 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:<br>
12:21 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)<br>
12:22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,<br>
12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn,<br>
(which are enrolled in heaven,)<br>
which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,<br>
(And to Jesus the mediator of the new Testament,)<br>
12:24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.<br>
12:25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 18-25 -- NLT<br>
18 You have not come to a physical mountain,<br>
(to something that can be touched,)<br>
to a place of flaming fire, darkness, gloom, and whirlwind, as the Israelites did at Mount Sinai.<br>
19 For they heard an awesome trumpet blast and a voice so terrible that they begged God to stop speaking.<br>
(which is referring to what the Israelites said in Exodus 20:19)<br>
20 They staggered back under God's command:<br>
"If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death."<br>
(quoting from Exodus 19:13)<br>
21 Moses himself was so frightened at the sight that he said,<br>
"I am terrified and trembling." (which is referring to Deuteronomy 9:19)<br>
22 No, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless thousands of angels in a joyful gathering.<br>
23 You have come to the assembly of God's firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect.<br>
24 You have come to Jesus, the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel.<br>
25 Be careful that you do not refuse to listen to the One who is speaking. For if the people of Israel did not escape when they refused to listen to Moses, the earthly messenger, we will certainly not escape if we reject the One who speaks to us from heaven!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 18-25 -- TS2009<br>
18 For you have not drawn near to a mountain touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness and storm,<br>
19 and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of words, so that those who heard it begged that no further Word should be spoken to them,<br>
(which is referring to what the Israelites said in Exodus 20:19)<br>
20 for they could not bear what was commanded, <br>
"If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot through with an arrow."<br>
(quoting from Exodus 19:13)<br>
21 And so fearsome was the sight that Moh-Shay said, (Moses said,)<br>
"I exceedingly fear and tremble." (which is referring to Deuteronomy 9:19)<br>
22 But you have drawn near to Mount Tsiyon and to the city of the living Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem), to the heavenly Yerushalayim, (the heavenly Jerusalem,) to myriads of messengers,<br>
23 to the entire gathering and assembly of the first-born having been enrolled in heaven, and to Elohim the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,<br>
24 and to Yaw-Who-Shaw the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks better than the blood of Heh-Bell (the blood of Abel).<br>
25 Take heed not to refuse the One speaking. For if those did not escape who refused the warning on earth, much less we who turn away from Him from heaven,<br>
<br>

Commentary:<br>
There are several places in the Bible, and in the traditions of cultural history, about the firstborn.<br>
Referring to this general traditional history of ancient cultures, and to the content found throughout the Bible...<br>
The firstborn, especially the firstborn son...<br>
was given certain unique rights, responsibilities, and privileges,<br>
was given priority and pre-eminence in the family, and the best of the inheritance,<br>
was believed to represent the prime of human strength and vitality, from when the parents were young and healthy.<br>
The firstborn was the "opener of the womb," and<br>
became the primary heir of the family.<br>
The firstborn's birthright traditionally involved a double portion of the inheritance of the household estate<br>
and the firstborn was given the leadership of the family if the father became incapacitated or was absent for some reason.<br>
<br>
In heaven, all of the saved, righteous children of God (the children of ELL-Low-Heem) will all be treated as if each one of them was the firstborn.<br>
The saved believers will all be saved, forgiven, pure, clean, perfect, immortal, and righteous, and He will treat them all as if they were the firstborn.<br>
Every child will be treated like the firstborn child in the kingdom of Heaven.<br>
<br>
Here are two Bible verses that support this. We read the first one just a moment ago.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:23 -- KJV<br>
12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn,<br>
(which are enrolled in heaven,)<br>
which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:23 -- NLT<br>
You have come to the assembly of God's firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:23 -- TS2009<br>
to the entire gathering and assembly of the first-born having been enrolled in heaven, and to Elohim the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:18 -- KJV<br>
1:18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:18 -- NLT<br>
He chose to give birth to us by giving us his true word.<br>
(And we became a kind of firstfruit of his creatures.)<br>
And we, out of all creation, became his prized possession.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:18 -- TS2009<br>
Having purposed it, He brought us forth by the Word of truth, for us to be a kind of first-fruits of His creatures.<br>

Commentary: I could easily desire to share with you at least twenty more songs that I really enjoy from Phil Wickham.<br>
In a moment, we will take a quick look at one that came out, back in the year of 2007.<br>
<br>
This song really captures how I was feeling at many times during the year of 2023, right on up to and into November of 2023.<br>
I would rather see myself and my family all depart from the earth in one moment, in the twinkling of an eye,<br>
and see us all be, what one might call, being raptured or translated, like Enoch and Elijah did. I would love and prefer to see my family all depart at one moment like that, together, so that one would not have to mourn during the absence of the other.<br>
<br>
But, if it should not be that way, and there was to be a funeral for me, I think that this next song is definitely the song I would want to have played at my funeral, or at the funeral of a believer that was suffering through hardships in their final days and months before they moved to their eternal, better dwelling place.<br>
<br>
My only disappointment in this next song is the technical detail about the mentioning of tears of joy. There is no crying and no tears in heaven. Tears from earth are stored in bottles, and every tear is documented with the full story about why each and every tear was cried. This is what the Bible teaches, and we have studied this already, during a random Bible study moment, back in Christian Essays 28, also known as, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 28.<br>
<br>
So, if you don't mind overlooking this small technical inaccuracy, the rest of this next song really tells the story behind how my heart was feeling at times, back in 2023, up into November 2023.<br>
<br>
<br>
And so, here, right now, is another moment when we take a look at another song by<br>
American contemporary Christian musician, singer and songwriter from San Diego, California,<br>
Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
The album, titled, Cannons, is the second commercial studio album by American contemporary Christian singer<br>
Phil Wickham, which was first released on 2 October 2007.<br>
<br>
From this 2007 album, Cannons, we find in there, at Track number 11,<br>
the song, titled, Home.<br>
<br>
<br>
From his album, Cannons, here are the words to the 2007 song, Home, by Phil Wickham...<br>
<br>
<br>
Come riding on a rushing wind<br>
Blow through our hair and touch our skin<br>
I want to feel you now like I felt you then<br>
Strip away my calloused heart<br>
Set your arrow, hit your mark<br>
Can you take me back to where love starts<br>
Can you take me back to where you are<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Back where I belong<br>
<br>
<br>
I know you've heard this all before<br>
When I'm down and crying on the floor<br>
Singing, "I want you and nothing more"<br>
But I'm breaking in my heart tonight<br>
I've tried to stand, I've tried to fight<br>
But I cannot see without your light<br>
No I cannot breathe without you<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Back where I belong<br>
<br>
<br>
When I saw you I was ashamed<br>
You were pure and I was stained<br>
But you ran to me and you called my name<br>
There were tears of joy upon your face<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Back into your arms<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
I'm back where I belong<br>

<br>
Leviticus 17:7 -- NLT<br>
(The people must no longer be unfaithful to the Lord by offering sacrifices to the goat demons.)<br>
The people must no longer be unfaithful to the Lord by offering sacrifices to the goat idols. This is a permanent law for them, to be observed from generation to generation.<br>

And let them no longer slaughter their slaughterings to demons, after whom they whored. This is a law forever for them throughout their generations." ' "<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Let's consult again are reference material which mainly includes the following two sources.<br>
We will consult The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, generally known as Strong's Concordance, which is a Bible concordance, an index of every word in the King James Version (KJV), constructed under the direction of James Strong, first published in the year of 1890.<br>
And will look at what is said in A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, by Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver, and Charles Augustus Briggs, more commonly known as Brown-Driver-Briggs or BDB (from the name of its three authors), first published in the year of 1906.<br>
<br>
In Leviticus 17:7<br>
KJV says, devils<br>
NLT said, goat demons or goat idols.<br>
What is that?<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word being used right there is pronounced, Saw-Ear.<br>
It could be pronounced a few different ways in the Hebrew.<br>
It could be pronounced, Saw-Ear, Saw-Air or Shaw-Air, with a slight rolling of the R sound at the end, perhaps.<br>
Here is what that Hebrew word can mean...<br>
faun -- which is a genetically-modified person with the body of a man and the legs and horns of a goat. It was one of the manipulated creations of the fallen watchers, and later became a rural deity worshipped by shepherds and farmers.<br>
satyr -- pronounced, Sat-Uh -- another name for a half human and half goat, a lecherous woodland god, part man, part goat, having or showing great or excessive sexual desire, especially in ways which are offensive.<br>
A hairy goat, a hairy, rough male goat.<br>
he-goat, buck, a demon in a male goat form,<br>
or having goat's feet,<br>
satyr, may refer to a demon possessed goat<br>
goat-demons; goat-idols<br>
satyr -- pronounced, Sat-Uh -- a god of the woods, with a man's face and body and a goat's legs and horns<br>
idols that Jeroboam had manufactured.<br>
King Josiah's revival probably involved the breaking down of the high places of the goat-demons, in 2 Kings 23:8.<br>
<br>
2 Kings 23:8 (NLT)<br>
Josiah brought to Jerusalem all the priests who were living in other towns of Judah. He also defiled the pagan shrines, where they had offered sacrifices -- all the way from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the shrines at the entrance to the gate of Joshua, the governor of Jerusalem. This gate was located to the left of the city gate as one enters the city.<br>

<a name="JAH34CONVOCREQD"></a><h2>Some Assembly Required</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Some Assembly Required<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:24-25<br>
KJV: And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.<br>
NLT: Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When it comes to the the assembling of ourselves together, our meeting together, there are certain days that we are required by a permanent law to gather together in an official, set-apart, holy assembly.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the NLT, there is what is called an official day for holy assembly.<br>
In the KJV, the same thing is called a holy convocation.<br>
<br>
What is identified as a permanent law in the NLT is called, in the KJV, an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.<br>
The KJV also talks about a permanent law by saying, that shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.<br>
So, the KJV ordinance for ever is called a permanent law in the NLT.<br>
The KJV may also say that a permanent law shall be a statute for ever in your generations, throughout your generations in all your dwellings.<br>
Let take a look at some official days for holy assembly and some permanent laws that are to be obeyed forever, no matter where you live.<br>
These permanent laws must be observed wherever you live, forever.<br>
It does not matter where you live right now. Wherever you live right now, you are to obey these permanent laws forever, and you should not forsake the meeting together, the assembling of ourselves together, on every official day for holy assembly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sabbath day of complete rest -- permanent law in the Ten Commandments.<br>
Every Saturday is an official day for holy assembly.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Exodus 19:8 "Remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23:3 (NLT)<br>
"You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of complete rest, an official day for holy assembly. It is the Lord's Sabbath day, and it must be observed wherever you live.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23:2 (NLT)<br>
"Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. These are the Lord's appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim as official days for holy assembly.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We now conclude with this final verse to think about...<br>
<br>
Leviticus 3:17 (NLT)<br>
"You must never eat any fat or blood. This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation, wherever you live."<br>
<br>
That points to a Bible study that we did a long time ago.<br>
That would be the Bible study, titled, Blood, which is in Christian Essays 10, which is the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 10.<br>
<br>
Since none of us ever could completely complete the obedience of the Torah completely, we need someone to help us complete it and accomplish all that the Torah is trying to accomplish in our lives.<br>
We need someone to complete what we could not complete, and accomplish what we could not accomplish. We need a Saviour to rescue us from our own self.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5:17 (NLT)<br>
Don't misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose.<br>
<br>
(Matthew) 5:17 (TS2009)<br>
Do not think that I came to destroy the Torah or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to complete.<br>

Commentary: Even in the areas of the Bible where the stories do not sound very happy, there are still lessons we can learn that are hiding in these stories that may not be quite so delightful to study.<br>
<br>
We have examples and stories where people made big decisions, but did not pray about it first.<br>
<br>
Before you make a big decision, pray about it first, and ask the Lord to give you wisdom and direction.<br>
Should you accept that job?<br>
Should you enter or start a business relationship with that person or business?<br>
Should you marry that person?<br>
Should you end that relationship?<br>
Should you move here or there, say yes or no, or should you sign that contract or agreement?<br>
Pray about it first.<br>
We have another example where people made big decisions but did not pray about it first.<br>
We mentioned in another Bible study about how, Lot made a decision to move somewhere, but did not pray about it first.<br>
He made the decision based on what he was physically and visually looking at only.<br>
Here is another example about some people that made a decision based on what they were looking at, but they did not pray about it.<br>
KJV: They asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.<br>
NLT: They did not consult the Lord.<br>
TS2009: They did not ask the mouth of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 20: 16 & 17 (KJV)<br>
20:16 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:<br>
20:17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 20: 16-18 (NLT)<br>
16 In those towns that the Lord your God is giving you as a special possession, destroy every living thing.<br>
17 You must completely destroy the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, just as the Lord your God has commanded you.<br>
18 This will prevent the people of the land from teaching you to imitate their detestable customs in the worship of their gods, which would cause you to sin deeply against the Lord your God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 7: 2-4 -- KJV<br>
7:2 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:<br>
7:3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.<br>
7:4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Looking at the term in the KJV, in verse 2, where it said, utterly destroy, in the NLT, they translated it as, completely destroy.<br>
Almost every time the NLT uses the term, "completely destroy," this is because, the original Hebrew language is referring to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 7: 2-4 -- NLT<br>
2 When the Lord your God hands these nations over to you and you conquer them, you must completely destroy them. Make no treaties with them and show them no mercy.<br>
3 You must not intermarry with them. Do not let your daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters,<br>
4 for they will lead your children away from me to worship other gods. Then the anger of the Lord will burn against you, and he will quickly destroy you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 7: 2-4 -- TS2009<br>
2 "And when Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem gives them over to you, you shall strike them and put them under the ban, completely. Make no covenant with them, and show them no favour.<br>
3 And do not intermarry with them – you do not give your daughter to his son, and you do not take his daughter for your son,"<br>
4 for he turns your sons away from following Me, to serve other mighty ones. Then the displeasure of Yaw-Who-Wah shall burn against you and promptly destroy you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: One day, some men just suddenly show up at Joshua's camp at Gilgal.<br>
Joshua and the people of Israel have no idea who these men are.<br>
They ask them who they are, but these men will not clearly identify themselves.<br>
Joshua does not know that these men are actually Hivites.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 9: 6-27 (reading to end of Chapter 9) -- KJV<br>
9:6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.<br>
9:7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell amongst us; and how shall we make a league with you?<br>
9:8 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?<br>
9:9 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,<br>
9:10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.<br>
<br>
9:11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying,<br>
(Take victuals in your hand for the journey,)<br>
Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.<br>
<br>
9:12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:<br>
9:13 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.<br>
(And they received the men by reason of their victuals,)<br>
9:14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.<br>
<br>
9:15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.<br>
9:16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt amongst them.<br>
9:17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.<br>
9:18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.<br>
9:19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.<br>
9:20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.<br>
9:21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.<br>
9:22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell amongst us?<br>
<br>
9:23 Now therefore ye are cursed,<br>
(and there shall not be cut off from you from being bondmen,)<br>
and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.<br>
<br>
9:24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.<br>
9:25 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.<br>
9:26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.<br>
9:27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 9: 6-27 -- NLT<br>
6 When they arrived at the camp of Israel at Gilgal, they told Joshua and the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant land to ask you to make a peace treaty with us."<br>
7 The Israelites replied to these Hivites, "How do we know you don't live nearby? For if you do, we cannot make a treaty with you."<br>
8 They replied, "We are your servants."<br>
"But who are you?" Joshua demanded. "Where do you come from?"<br>
9 They answered, "Your servants have come from a very distant country. We have heard of the might of the Lord your God and of all he did in Egypt.<br>
10 We have also heard what he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River -- King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan (who lived in Ashtaroth).<br>
11 So our elders and all our people instructed us, 'Take supplies for a long journey. Go meet with the people of Israel and tell them, "We are your servants; please make a treaty with us."'<br>
12 "This bread was hot from the ovens when we left our homes. But now, as you can see, it is dry and mouldy.<br>
13 These wineskins were new when we filled them, but now they are old and split open. And our clothing and sandals are worn out from our very long journey."<br>
14 So the Israelites examined their food, but they did not consult the Lord.<br>
15 Then Joshua made a peace treaty with them and guaranteed their safety, and the leaders of the community ratified their agreement with a binding oath.<br>
16 Three days after making the treaty, they learned that these people actually lived nearby!<br>
17 The Israelites set out at once to investigate and reached their towns in three days. The names of these towns were Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.<br>
18 But the Israelites did not attack the towns, for the Israelite leaders had made a vow to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.<br>
The people of Israel grumbled against their leaders because of the treaty.<br>
19 But the leaders replied, "Since we have sworn an oath in the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel, we cannot touch them.<br>
20 This is what we must do. We must let them live, for divine anger would come upon us if we broke our oath.<br>
21 Let them live." So they made them woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community, as the Israelite leaders directed.<br>
22 Joshua called together the Gibeonites and said, "Why did you lie to us? Why did you say that you live in a distant land when you live right here amongst us?<br>
23 May you be cursed! From now on you will always be servants who cut wood and carry water for the house of my God."<br>
24 They replied, "We did it because we -- your servants -- were clearly told that the Lord your God commanded his servant Moses to give you this entire land and to destroy all the people living in it. So we feared greatly for our lives because of you. That is why we have done this.<br>
25 Now we are at your mercy -- do to us whatever you think is right."<br>
26 So Joshua did not allow the people of Israel to kill them.<br>
27 But that day he made the Gibeonites the woodcutters and water carriers for the community of Israel and for the altar of the Lord -- wherever the Lord would choose to build it. And that is what they do to this day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 9: 6-27 -- TS2009<br>
6 And they went to Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua), to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), "We have come from a far land, and now, make a covenant with us."<br>
7 But the men of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) said to the Hiwwites, "It could be that you dwell in our midst, so how would we make a covenant with you?"<br>
8 And they said to Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua), "We are your servants." And Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua) said to them, "Who are you, and where do you come from?"<br>
9 So they said to him, "From a land very far off your servants have come, because of the Name of Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem. For we have heard the report of Him, and all that He did in Meets-Rye-EEm (Egypt),<br>
10 and all that He had done to the two sovereigns of the Amorites who were beyond the Yarden (Jordan River), to Sihon sovereign of Heshbon, and Ogg sovereign of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.<br>
11 "So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spoke to us, saying, 'Take food with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, "We are your servants, and now, make a covenant with us." '<br>
12 "This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day that we left to come to you. But now, see, it is dry and it is crumby.<br>
13 "And these wineskins which we filled were new, and see, they are torn. And these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey."<br>
14 And the men of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) took some of their food, but they did not ask the mouth of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
15 And Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua) made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live, and the rulers of the congregation swore to them.<br>
16 And it came to be at the end of three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours who dwelt near them.<br>
17 And the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Kephirah, and Be'eroth, and Qiryath Ye'arim.<br>
18 But the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) did not strike them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by Yaw-Who-Wah ELL-Low-Heem of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL). And all the congregation grumbled against the rulers.<br>
19 But all the rulers said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by Yaw-Who-Wah ELL-Low-Heem of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), and we are unable to touch them now.<br>
20 "Let us do this to them: We shall keep them alive, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them."<br>
21 And the rulers said to them, "Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the rulers had promised them."<br>
22 Then Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua) called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' yet you are dwelling in our midst?<br>
23 "And now you are cursed, and you shall not cease from being slaves, and woodcutters and drawers of water for the House of my ELL-Low-Heem."<br>
24 And they answered Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua) and said, "Your servants were clearly told that Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem commanded His servant Moe-Shay (Moses) to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. So we were very much afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this deed.<br>
25 "And now, see, we are in your hands. Do with us as it seems good and right to do to us."<br>
26 And he did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), and they did not kill them.<br>
27 And that day Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua) made them woodcutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the slaughter-place of Yaw-Who-Wah, even to this day, at the place that He should choose.<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 11:19 (KJV)<br>
There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 11:19 (NLT)<br>
No one in this region made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites of Gibeon. All the others were defeated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Were they really defeated? Did the children of Israel obey the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah?<br>
Let's fast-forward to the book of Judges and find out.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Judges 3: 5-7 (KJV)<br>
3:5 And the children of Israel dwelt amongst the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:<br>
3:6 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.<br>
3:7 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Judges 3: 5-7 (NLT)<br>
5 So the people of Israel lived amongst the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,<br>
6 and they intermarried with them. Israelite sons married their daughters, and Israelite daughters were given in marriage to their sons. And the Israelites served their gods.<br>
7 The Israelites did evil in the Lord's sight. They forgot about the Lord their God, and they served the images of Baal and the Asherah poles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Master Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give us wisdom, discernment and direction so that we do not go in a direction or enter into a relationship that will cause our relationship with you to be weakened or degraded. In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>

<a name="JAH34IBERIALONDINIUM"></a><h2>Paul in Spain and England</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Paul in Spain and England<br>
<br>
<br>
Did Paul ever go to the areas of Spain and England?<br>
He was planning to go to Spain.<br>
Paul talks about his Travel Plans in Romans 15.<br>
<br>
Romans 15:24 -- KJV<br>
15:24 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you,<br>
(if first I be somewhat filled with you.)<br>
if first I be somewhat filled with your company.<br>
<br>
Romans 15:24 -- TS2009<br>
24 I shall come to you when I go to Spain. For I expect to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 15: 23 & 24 -- NLT<br>
23 But now I have finished my work in these regions, and after all these long years of waiting, I am eager to visit you.<br>
24 I am planning to go to Spain, and when I do, I will stop off in Rome. And after I have enjoyed your fellowship for a little while, you can provide for my journey.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Acts normally goes up to Chapter 28.<br>
Paul usually ends his writings with an Amen at the end, but in the book of Acts, he did not.<br>
Could Paul's lack of the word, Amen, at the end of Acts 28 possibly suggest that, perhaps the end of Acts Chapter 28 is not really the end of the book?<br>
If that is so, then maybe Chapter 28 was not actually the last chapter of the book of Acts. Is there a lost Chapter 29 somewhere?<br>
<br>
In this Bible study, we will consider, the Acts of the Apostles Lost Chapter 29, Sonnini Manuscript.<br>
<br>
Who is Sonnini?<br>
We will gather some material now from Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia, as it was published back in February of 2024.<br>
<br>
Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt, was born in the year of 1751, and he passed away in 1812.<br>
Sonnini was a Botanist and a French naturalist, which is someone who studies the Natural history of organisms, including animals, fungi, and plants, in their natural environment, leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study.<br>
<br>
In a French publication by Sonnini, back in 1801, this copy the Acts of the Apostles chapter 29 was found.<br>
Is it real or is it fake?<br>
<br>

as of February 2024<br>
it says on this webpage that,<br>
The text made its first appearance in London in 1871.<br>
Mainstream philology considers it to most likely be a fraud.<br>
<br>
Doctor Stephen Pidgeon does not think it is a fraud, and after doing extensive research, has included it in his book, the Eth Cepher.<br>
The word, Eth, is spelled E T H, and it is pronounced, "et" as in the word, "set" but without the letter S sound.<br>
<br>
Doctor Stephen Pidgeon is a political scientist with a Doctorate of Philosophy, and a Juris Doctorate.<br>
A Juris Doctorate is a graduate-entry professional degree that primarily prepares individuals to practice law. In the United States, it is the only qualifying law degree.<br>
In collaboration with a group of students of scripture, Stephen Pidgeon is responsible for the creation and publication of the Eth Cepher.<br>
Dr Pidgeon is a student of many languages including Greek, Hebrew, Russian, French, Spanish and Italian.<br>
An avid reader and author, he has published over 30 books.<br>
His book, the Eth Cepher, is published at Cepher Publishing Group, which is at cepher.net.<br>
<br>
Stephen Pidgeon has researched the validity and historical accuracy of Acts Chapter 29, and believes it to be an original Greek copy.<br>
Here are a few things that Stephen Pidgeon said in a 2020 web log post, that help to prove this as being a valid and true chapter of the Book of Acts.<br>
You can read the entire webpage with all of his evidence presented, at the following webpage address:<br>

<br>
We will now read and quote a few selected areas from this cepher.net webpage.<br>
This webpage is part of<br>
Stephen Pidgeon's Blog.<br>
The Blog is titled,<br>
Chapter 29 – The last chapter of the Book of Acts.<br>
This webpage was published on 13 July 2020.<br>
<br>
Stephen Pidgeon is quoted on this webpage as saying,<br>
Yes, Chapter 29 was originally found in Greek.<br>
Pa'al (Paul) intended to travel into Spain.<br>
(Romans) 15:24<br>
24 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.<br>
<br>
...Acts 28, which, unlike the other Scriptures of the New Testament, does not end with the resounding Amein (Amen). This difficulty is cured with the addition of the 29th chapter.<br>
<br>
Translations which were initially created in the 1500s (the Bishop's Bible, the 1535 Tyndale, the 1537 Coverdale, the 1560 Geneva) or 1600s (the 1611 KJV-Authorised Version) necessarily would not have access to this text, given its discovery after they were published.<br>
<br>
Most translations of the 20th century are based on the forged documents used by Westcott & Hort (Codex Sinaiticus), which excluded all of the Apocrypha and did not include Acts 29, since the forger of the Codex Sinaiticus was using a 16th century Textus Receptus as a source for his document. Westcott & Hort published their New Testament in 1881, known as the Westcott and Hort text, or the WH. The Codex Sinaiticus was forged by Constantine Simonides, who repeatedly confessed his forgery in the London press for two years following the publication of the WH (the Westcott & Hort), all to no avail. He died of Leprosy in Egypt in 1890.<br>
<br>
We have several extensive proofs that Pa'al (Paul) not only visited Spain but established nearly a dozen bishopries (being in charge of a group of churches in an area) while he was there.  There is an extensive record of his visit(s) to Britain (in fact, his bones were moved to Canterbury in AD 686), and the remainder of the record set forth in Acts 29 has been well-established historically.<br>
<br>
That is the end of the selected quotations from Stephen Pidgeon's Blog.<br>
<br>
<br>
We will now read Acts 29 from godskingdom.org.<br>

<br>
We will start reading in the NLT, 5th Edition, and keep reading into Acts 29, switching from the NLT, to The Sonnini Manuscript.<br>
<br>
First, Paul Sails for Rome.<br>
There is The Storm at Sea, The Shipwreck,<br>
And then, in Acts, Chapter 28,<br>
Paul is on the Island of Malta.<br>
Paul Arrives at Rome, and then Paul Preaches at Rome under Guard.<br>
After he reads to them the Greek Version of Isaiah 6:9-10, Paul says this...<br>
28 So I want you to know that this salvation from God has also been offered to the Gentiles, and they will accept it."<br>
<br>
29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, greatly disagreeing with each other.<br>
<br>
30 For the next two years, Paul lived in Rome at his own expense.<br>
(Paul lived in Rome in his own rented quarters.)<br>
He welcomed all who visited him,<br>
31 boldly proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ. And no one tried to stop him.<br>
<br>
1 And Paul, full of the blessings of Christ and abounding in the spirit, departed out of Rome, determining to go into Spain, for he had a long time purposed to journey thitherward, and was minded also to go from thence into Britain.<br>
<br>
2 For he had heard in Phoenicia that certain of the children of Israel, about the time of the Assyrian captivity,<br>
had escaped by sea to "the isles afar off," as spoken by the prophets, (as spoken of by the Prophet Esdra) and called by the Romans, Britain.<br>
<br>
3 And the Lord commanded the gospel to be preached far hence to (the nations) the Gentiles, and to the lost sheep of the House of Israel.<br>
<br>
4 And no man hindered Paul; for he testified boldly of Jesus before the tribunes and among the people; and he took with him certain of the brethren which abode with him at Rome, and they took shipping to Ostium, and having the winds fair, were brought safely into an haven of Spain.<br>
<br>
5 And much people were gathered together from the towns and villages and the hill country; for they had heard of the conversion of the apostle and the many miracles which he had wrought.<br>
<br>
6 And Paul preached mightily in Spain, and great multitudes believed and were converted, for they perceived he was an apostle sent from God.<br>
<br>
7 And they departed out of Spain, and Paul and his company finding a ship in Armorica sailing unto Britain, they went therein, and passing along the south coast, they reached a port called Raphinus.<br>
(Raphinus is the Roman name for Sandwich, in Kent. In Saxon times there was, still standing in Sandwich, an old house called the "House of the shlichim" and tradition has it that Paulos (Paul) was one of the shlichim).<br>
(Shlichim are Israeli educators or cultural ambassadors, emissaries, who spend an extended period of time abroad to bring Israel to the community.)<br>
<br>
8 Now when it was noised abroad that the apostle had landed on their coast, great multitudes of the inhabitants met him, and they treated Paul courteously; and he entered in at the east gate of their city and lodged in the house of an Hebrew and one of his own nation.<br>
<br>
9 And on the morrow he came and stood upon Mount Lud [now Ludgate Hill and Broadway, where St. Paul's Cathedral is built in London];<br>
(Ludgate Hill and Broadway is where St. Paulos's Cathedral stands in London, England)<br>
(Ludgate Hill is a hill in the City of London, near the old Ludgate, a gate to the City that was taken down in 1780.)<br>
<br>
and the people thronged at the gate and assembled in the Broadway; and he preached Christ unto them, and many believed the word and the testimony of Jesus.<br>
<br>
10 And at even the Holy Ghost fell upon Paul, and he prophesied, saying, "Behold, in the last days the God of Peace shall dwell in the cities, and the inhabitants thereof shall be numbered; and in the seventh numbering of the people, their eyes shall be opened and the glory of their inheritance shine forth before them. And nations shall come up to worship on the Mount that testifieth of the patience and long suffering of a servant of the Lord.<br>
<br>
11 And in the latter days new tidings of the Gospel shall issue forth out of Jerusalem, and the hearts of the people shall rejoice, and behold, fountains shall be opened and there shall be no more plague.<br>
<br>
12 In those days there shall be wars and rumours of wars; and a King shall rise up, and His sword shall be for the healing of the nations, and His peace-making shall abide, and the glory of His Kingdom a wonder among princes."<br>
<br>
13 And it came to pass that certain of the Druids came unto Paul privately and showed by their rites and ceremonies they were descended from the Judahites which escaped from the bondage in the land of Egypt; and the apostle believed these things, and he gave them the kiss of peace.<br>
<br>
14 And Paul abode in his lodgings three months, confirming in the faith and preaching Christ continually.<br>
<br>
15 And after these things, Paul and his brethren departed from Raphinus, (the Roman name for Sandwich,) and sailed unto Atium in Gaul.<br>
<br>
16 And Paul preached in the Roman garrisons and among the people, exhorting all men to repent and confess their sins.<br>
<br>
(The Belgae were a large confederation of tribes living in northern Gaul, between the English Channel and the west bank of the Rhine, from at least the third century BC. They were discussed in depth by Julius Caesar in his account of his wars in Gaul.)<br>
<br>
17 And there came to him certain of the Belgae to enquire of him of the new doctrine and of the man Jesus; and Paul opened his heart unto them and told them all things that had befallen Him, how be it that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; and they departed, pondering among themselves upon the things which they had heard.<br>
<br>
18 And after much preaching and toil, Paul and his fellow labourers passed into Helvetia [now Switzerland] and came unto Mount Pontius Pilate, where he who condemned the Lord Jesus dashed himself down headlong and so miserably perished.<br>
<br>
19 And immediately a torrent gushed out of the mountain and washed his body, broken in pieces, into a lake.<br>
<br>
20 And Paul stretched forth his hands upon the water and prayed unto the Lord, saying, "O Lord God, give a sign unto all nations that here Pontius Pilate, which condemned Thine only begotten Son, plunged headlong into the pit."<br>
<br>
21 And while Paul was yet speaking, behold, there came a great earthquake, and the face of the waters was changed, and the form of the lake like unto the Son of Man hanging in an agony upon the cross.<br>
<br>
22 And a voice came out of heaven, saying, "Even Pilate hath escaped the wrath to come, for he washed his hands before the multitude at the blood shedding of the Lord Jesus."<br>
<br>
23 When, therefore, Paul and those that were with him saw the earthquake and heard the voice of the angel, they glorified God and were mightily strengthened in spirit.<br>
<br>
24 And they journeyed and came to Mount Julius, where stood two pillars, one on the right hand and one on the left hand, erected by Caesar Augustus.<br>
<br>
25 And Paul, filled with the Holy Ghost, stood up between the two pillars, saying, "Men and brethren, these stones which you see this day shall testify of my journey hence; and verily I say, they shall remain until the outpouring of the Spirit upon all nations, neither shall the way be hindered throughout all generations."<br>
<br>
26 And they went forth and came unto Illyricum, intending to go by Macedonia into Asia, and grace was found in all the churches; and they prospered and had peace. Amen.<br>
