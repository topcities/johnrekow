Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

Hebrews 12: 18-25 -- KJV<br>
12:18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,<br>
12:19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:<br>
12:20 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:<br>
12:21 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)<br>
12:22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,<br>
12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn,<br>
(which are enrolled in heaven,)<br>
which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,<br>
(And to Jesus the mediator of the new Testament,)<br>
12:24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.<br>
12:25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 18-25 -- NLT<br>
18 You have not come to a physical mountain,<br>
(to something that can be touched,)<br>
to a place of flaming fire, darkness, gloom, and whirlwind, as the Israelites did at Mount Sinai.<br>
19 For they heard an awesome trumpet blast and a voice so terrible that they begged God to stop speaking.<br>
(which is referring to what the Israelites said in Exodus 20:19)<br>
20 They staggered back under God's command:<br>
"If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death."<br>
(quoting from Exodus 19:13)<br>
21 Moses himself was so frightened at the sight that he said,<br>
"I am terrified and trembling." (which is referring to Deuteronomy 9:19)<br>
22 No, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless thousands of angels in a joyful gathering.<br>
23 You have come to the assembly of God's firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect.<br>
24 You have come to Jesus, the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel.<br>
25 Be careful that you do not refuse to listen to the One who is speaking. For if the people of Israel did not escape when they refused to listen to Moses, the earthly messenger, we will certainly not escape if we reject the One who speaks to us from heaven!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 18-25 -- TS2009<br>
18 For you have not drawn near to a mountain touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness and storm,<br>
19 and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of words, so that those who heard it begged that no further Word should be spoken to them,<br>
(which is referring to what the Israelites said in Exodus 20:19)<br>
20 for they could not bear what was commanded, <br>
"If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot through with an arrow."<br>
(quoting from Exodus 19:13)<br>
21 And so fearsome was the sight that Moh-Shay said, (Moses said,)<br>
"I exceedingly fear and tremble." (which is referring to Deuteronomy 9:19)<br>
22 But you have drawn near to Mount Tsiyon and to the city of the living Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem), to the heavenly Yerushalayim, (the heavenly Jerusalem,) to myriads of messengers,<br>
23 to the entire gathering and assembly of the first-born having been enrolled in heaven, and to Elohim the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,<br>
24 and to Yaw-Who-Shaw the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks better than the blood of Heh-Bell (the blood of Abel).<br>
25 Take heed not to refuse the One speaking. For if those did not escape who refused the warning on earth, much less we who turn away from Him from heaven,<br>
<br>

Commentary:<br>
There are several places in the Bible, and in the traditions of cultural history, about the firstborn.<br>
Referring to this general traditional history of ancient cultures, and to the content found throughout the Bible...<br>
The firstborn, especially the firstborn son...<br>
was given certain unique rights, responsibilities, and privileges,<br>
was given priority and pre-eminence in the family, and the best of the inheritance,<br>
was believed to represent the prime of human strength and vitality, from when the parents were young and healthy.<br>
The firstborn was the "opener of the womb," and<br>
became the primary heir of the family.<br>
The firstborn's birthright traditionally involved a double portion of the inheritance of the household estate<br>
and the firstborn was given the leadership of the family if the father became incapacitated or was absent for some reason.<br>
<br>
In heaven, all of the saved, righteous children of God (the children of ELL-Low-Heem) will all be treated as if each one of them was the firstborn.<br>
The saved believers will all be saved, forgiven, pure, clean, perfect, immortal, and righteous, and He will treat them all as if they were the firstborn.<br>
Every child will be treated like the firstborn child in the kingdom of Heaven.<br>
<br>
Here are two Bible verses that support this. We read the first one just a moment ago.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:23 -- KJV<br>
12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn,<br>
(which are enrolled in heaven,)<br>
which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:23 -- NLT<br>
You have come to the assembly of God's firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:23 -- TS2009<br>
to the entire gathering and assembly of the first-born having been enrolled in heaven, and to Elohim the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:18 -- KJV<br>
1:18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:18 -- NLT<br>
He chose to give birth to us by giving us his true word.<br>
(And we became a kind of firstfruit of his creatures.)<br>
And we, out of all creation, became his prized possession.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:18 -- TS2009<br>
Having purposed it, He brought us forth by the Word of truth, for us to be a kind of first-fruits of His creatures.<br>

Commentary: I could easily desire to share with you at least twenty more songs that I really enjoy from Phil Wickham.<br>
In a moment, we will take a quick look at one that came out, back in the year of 2007.<br>
<br>
This song really captures how I was feeling at many times during the year of 2023, right on up to and into November of 2023.<br>
I would rather see myself and my family all depart from the earth in one moment, in the twinkling of an eye,<br>
and see us all be, what one might call, being raptured or translated, like Enoch and Elijah did. I would love and prefer to see my family all depart at one moment like that, together, so that one would not have to mourn during the absence of the other.<br>
<br>
But, if it should not be that way, and there was to be a funeral for me, I think that this next song is definitely the song I would want to have played at my funeral, or at the funeral of a believer that was suffering through hardships in their final days and months before they moved to their eternal, better dwelling place.<br>
<br>
My only disappointment in this next song is the technical detail about the mentioning of tears of joy. There is no crying and no tears in heaven. Tears from earth are stored in bottles, and every tear is documented with the full story about why each and every tear was cried. This is what the Bible teaches, and we have studied this already, during a random Bible study moment, back in Christian Essays 28, also known as, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 28.<br>
<br>
So, if you don't mind overlooking this small technical inaccuracy, the rest of this next song really tells the story behind how my heart was feeling at times, back in 2023, up into November 2023.<br>
<br>
<br>
And so, here, right now, is another moment when we take a look at another song by<br>
American contemporary Christian musician, singer and songwriter from San Diego, California,<br>
Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
The album, titled, Cannons, is the second commercial studio album by American contemporary Christian singer<br>
Phil Wickham, which was first released on 2 October 2007.<br>
<br>
From this 2007 album, Cannons, we find in there, at Track number 11,<br>
the song, titled, Home.<br>
<br>
<br>
From his album, Cannons, here are the words to the 2007 song, Home, by Phil Wickham...<br>
<br>
<br>
Come riding on a rushing wind<br>
Blow through our hair and touch our skin<br>
I want to feel you now like I felt you then<br>
Strip away my calloused heart<br>
Set your arrow, hit your mark<br>
Can you take me back to where love starts<br>
Can you take me back to where you are<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Back where I belong<br>
<br>
<br>
I know you've heard this all before<br>
When I'm down and crying on the floor<br>
Singing, "I want you and nothing more"<br>
But I'm breaking in my heart tonight<br>
I've tried to stand, I've tried to fight<br>
But I cannot see without your light<br>
No I cannot breathe without you<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Back where I belong<br>
<br>
<br>
When I saw you I was ashamed<br>
You were pure and I was stained<br>
But you ran to me and you called my name<br>
There were tears of joy upon your face<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Back into your arms<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
I'm back where I belong<br>

Leviticus 17:7 -- KJV<br>

<br>
<br>
Leviticus 17:7 -- NLT<br>
(The people must no longer be unfaithful to the Lord by offering sacrifices to the goat demons.)<br>
The people must no longer be unfaithful to the Lord by offering sacrifices to the goat idols. This is a permanent law for them, to be observed from generation to generation.<br>

And let them no longer slaughter their slaughterings to demons, after whom they whored. This is a law forever for them throughout their generations." ' "<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Let's consult again are reference material which mainly includes the following two sources.<br>
We will consult The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, generally known as Strong's Concordance, which is a Bible concordance, an index of every word in the King James Version (KJV), constructed under the direction of James Strong, first published in the year of 1890.<br>
And will look at what is said in A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, by Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver, and Charles Augustus Briggs, more commonly known as Brown-Driver-Briggs or BDB (from the name of its three authors), first published in the year of 1906.<br>
<br>
In Leviticus 17:7<br>
KJV says, devils<br>
NLT said, goat demons or goat idols.<br>
What is that?<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word being used right there is pronounced, Saw-Ear.<br>
It could be pronounced a few different ways in the Hebrew.<br>
It could be pronounced, Saw-Ear, Saw-Air or Shaw-Air, with a slight rolling of the R sound at the end, perhaps.<br>
Here is what that Hebrew word can mean...<br>
faun -- which is a genetically-modified person with the body of a man and the legs and horns of a goat. It was one of the manipulated creations of the fallen watchers, and later became a rural deity worshipped by shepherds and farmers.<br>
satyr -- pronounced, Sat-Uh -- another name for a half human and half goat, a lecherous woodland god, part man, part goat, having or showing great or excessive sexual desire, especially in ways which are offensive.<br>
A hairy goat, a hairy, rough male goat.<br>
he-goat, buck, a demon in a male goat form,<br>
or having goat's feet,<br>
satyr, may refer to a demon possessed goat<br>
goat-demons; goat-idols<br>
satyr -- pronounced, Sat-Uh -- a god of the woods, with a man's face and body and a goat's legs and horns<br>
idols that Jeroboam had manufactured.<br>
King Josiah's revival probably involved the breaking down of the high places of the goat-demons, in 2 Kings 23:8.<br>
<br>
2 Kings 23:8 (NLT)<br>
Josiah brought to Jerusalem all the priests who were living in other towns of Judah. He also defiled the pagan shrines, where they had offered sacrifices -- all the way from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the shrines at the entrance to the gate of Joshua, the governor of Jerusalem. This gate was located to the left of the city gate as one enters the city.<br>

<a name="JAH34CONVOCREQD"></a><h2>Some Assembly Required</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Some Assembly Required<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:24-25<br>
KJV: And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.<br>
NLT: Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When it comes to the the assembling of ourselves together, our meeting together, there are certain days that we are required by a permanent law to gather together in an official, set-apart, holy assembly.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the NLT, there is what is called an official day for holy assembly.<br>
In the KJV, the same thing is called a holy convocation.<br>
<br>
What is identified as a permanent law in the NLT is called, in the KJV, an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.<br>
The KJV also talks about a permanent law by saying, that shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.<br>
So, the KJV ordinance for ever is called a permanent law in the NLT.<br>
The KJV may also say that a permanent law shall be a statute for ever in your generations, throughout your generations in all your dwellings.<br>
Let take a look at some official days for holy assembly and some permanent laws that are to be obeyed forever, no matter where you live.<br>
These permanent laws must be observed wherever you live, forever.<br>
It does not matter where you live right now. Wherever you live right now, you are to obey these permanent laws forever, and you should not forsake the meeting together, the assembling of ourselves together, on every official day for holy assembly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sabbath day of complete rest -- permanent law in the Ten Commandments.<br>
Every Saturday is an official day for holy assembly.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Exodus 19:8 "Remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23:3 (NLT)<br>
"You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of complete rest, an official day for holy assembly. It is the Lord's Sabbath day, and it must be observed wherever you live.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23:2 (NLT)<br>
"Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. These are the Lord's appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim as official days for holy assembly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23:4 (NLT)<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast 6 of 7.<br>
The Day of Atonement<br>

an official day for holy assembly<br>
a permanent law<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Leviticus 23:36 (NLT)<br>

"These are the Lord's appointed festivals. Celebrate them each year as official days for holy assembly by presenting special gifts to the Lord -- burnt offerings, grain offerings, sacrifices, and liquid offerings -- each on its proper day.<br>
<br>
<br>
We now conclude with this final verse to think about...<br>
<br>
Leviticus 3:17 (NLT)<br>
"You must never eat any fat or blood. This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation, wherever you live."<br>
<br>
That points to a Bible study that we did a long time ago.<br>
That would be the Bible study, titled, Blood, which is in Christian Essays 10, which is the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 10.<br>
<br>
Since none of us ever could completely complete the obedience of the Torah completely, we need someone to help us complete it and accomplish all that the Torah is trying to accomplish in our lives.<br>
We need someone to complete what we could not complete, and accomplish what we could not accomplish. We need a Saviour to rescue us from our own self.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5:17 (NLT)<br>
Don't misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose.<br>
<br>
(Matthew) 5:17 (TS2009)<br>
Do not think that I came to destroy the Torah or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to complete.<br>
