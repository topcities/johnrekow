Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

Hebrews 12: 18-25 -- KJV<br>
12:18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,<br>
12:19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:<br>
12:20 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:<br>
12:21 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)<br>
12:22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,<br>
12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn,<br>
(which are enrolled in heaven,)<br>
which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,<br>
(And to Jesus the mediator of the new Testament,)<br>
12:24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.<br>
12:25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 18-25 -- NLT<br>
18 You have not come to a physical mountain,<br>
(to something that can be touched,)<br>
to a place of flaming fire, darkness, gloom, and whirlwind, as the Israelites did at Mount Sinai.<br>
19 For they heard an awesome trumpet blast and a voice so terrible that they begged God to stop speaking.<br>
(which is referring to what the Israelites said in Exodus 20:19)<br>
20 They staggered back under God's command:<br>
"If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death."<br>
(quoting from Exodus 19:13)<br>
21 Moses himself was so frightened at the sight that he said,<br>
"I am terrified and trembling." (which is referring to Deuteronomy 9:19)<br>
22 No, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless thousands of angels in a joyful gathering.<br>
23 You have come to the assembly of God's firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect.<br>
24 You have come to Jesus, the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel.<br>
25 Be careful that you do not refuse to listen to the One who is speaking. For if the people of Israel did not escape when they refused to listen to Moses, the earthly messenger, we will certainly not escape if we reject the One who speaks to us from heaven!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 18-25 -- TS2009<br>
18 For you have not drawn near to a mountain touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness and storm,<br>
19 and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of words, so that those who heard it begged that no further Word should be spoken to them,<br>
(which is referring to what the Israelites said in Exodus 20:19)<br>
20 for they could not bear what was commanded, <br>
"If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot through with an arrow."<br>
(quoting from Exodus 19:13)<br>
21 And so fearsome was the sight that Moh-Shay said, (Moses said,)<br>
"I exceedingly fear and tremble." (which is referring to Deuteronomy 9:19)<br>
22 But you have drawn near to Mount Tsiyon and to the city of the living Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem), to the heavenly Yerushalayim, (the heavenly Jerusalem,) to myriads of messengers,<br>
23 to the entire gathering and assembly of the first-born having been enrolled in heaven, and to Elohim the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,<br>
24 and to Yaw-Who-Shaw the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks better than the blood of Heh-Bell (the blood of Abel).<br>
25 Take heed not to refuse the One speaking. For if those did not escape who refused the warning on earth, much less we who turn away from Him from heaven,<br>
<br>

Commentary:<br>
There are several places in the Bible, and in the traditions of cultural history, about the firstborn.<br>
Referring to this general traditional history of ancient cultures, and to the content found throughout the Bible...<br>
The firstborn, especially the firstborn son...<br>
was given certain unique rights, responsibilities, and privileges,<br>
was given priority and pre-eminence in the family, and the best of the inheritance,<br>
was believed to represent the prime of human strength and vitality, from when the parents were young and healthy.<br>
The firstborn was the "opener of the womb," and<br>
became the primary heir of the family.<br>
The firstborn's birthright traditionally involved a double portion of the inheritance of the household estate<br>
and the firstborn was given the leadership of the family if the father became incapacitated or was absent for some reason.<br>
<br>
In heaven, all of the saved, righteous children of God (the children of ELL-Low-Heem) will all be treated as if each one of them was the firstborn.<br>
The saved believers will all be saved, forgiven, pure, clean, perfect, immortal, and righteous, and He will treat them all as if they were the firstborn.<br>
Every child will be treated like the firstborn child in the kingdom of Heaven.<br>
<br>
Here are two Bible verses that support this. We read the first one just a moment ago.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:23 -- KJV<br>
12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn,<br>
(which are enrolled in heaven,)<br>
which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:23 -- NLT<br>
You have come to the assembly of God's firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:23 -- TS2009<br>
to the entire gathering and assembly of the first-born having been enrolled in heaven, and to Elohim the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:18 -- KJV<br>
1:18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:18 -- NLT<br>
He chose to give birth to us by giving us his true word.<br>
(And we became a kind of firstfruit of his creatures.)<br>
And we, out of all creation, became his prized possession.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:18 -- TS2009<br>
Having purposed it, He brought us forth by the Word of truth, for us to be a kind of first-fruits of His creatures.<br>

Commentary: I could easily desire to share with you at least twenty more songs that I really enjoy from Phil Wickham.<br>
In a moment, we will take a quick look at one that came out, back in the year of 2007.<br>
<br>
This song really captures how I was feeling at many times during the year of 2023, right on up to and into November of 2023.<br>
I would rather see myself and my family all depart from the earth in one moment, in the twinkling of an eye,<br>
and see us all be, what one might call, being raptured or translated, like Enoch and Elijah did. I would love and prefer to see my family all depart at one moment like that, together, so that one would not have to mourn during the absence of the other.<br>
<br>
But, if it should not be that way, and there was to be a funeral for me, I think that this next song is definitely the song I would want to have played at my funeral, or at the funeral of a believer that was suffering through hardships in their final days and months before they moved to their eternal, better dwelling place.<br>
<br>
My only disappointment in this next song is the technical detail about the mentioning of tears of joy. There is no crying and no tears in heaven. Tears from earth are stored in bottles, and every tear is documented with the full story about why each and every tear was cried. This is what the Bible teaches, and we have studied this already, during a random Bible study moment, back in Christian Essays 28, also known as, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 28.<br>
<br>
So, if you don't mind overlooking this small technical inaccuracy, the rest of this next song really tells the story behind how my heart was feeling at times, back in 2023, up into November 2023.<br>
<br>
<br>
And so, here, right now, is another moment when we take a look at another song by<br>
American contemporary Christian musician, singer and songwriter from San Diego, California,<br>
Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
The album, titled, Cannons, is the second commercial studio album by American contemporary Christian singer<br>
Phil Wickham, which was first released on 2 October 2007.<br>
<br>
From this 2007 album, Cannons, we find in there, at Track number 11,<br>
the song, titled, Home.<br>
<br>
<br>
From his album, Cannons, here are the words to the 2007 song, Home, by Phil Wickham...<br>
<br>
<br>
Come riding on a rushing wind<br>
Blow through our hair and touch our skin<br>
I want to feel you now like I felt you then<br>
Strip away my calloused heart<br>
Set your arrow, hit your mark<br>
Can you take me back to where love starts<br>
Can you take me back to where you are<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Back where I belong<br>
<br>
<br>
I know you've heard this all before<br>
When I'm down and crying on the floor<br>
Singing, "I want you and nothing more"<br>
But I'm breaking in my heart tonight<br>
I've tried to stand, I've tried to fight<br>
But I cannot see without your light<br>
No I cannot breathe without you<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Back where I belong<br>
<br>
<br>
When I saw you I was ashamed<br>
You were pure and I was stained<br>
But you ran to me and you called my name<br>
There were tears of joy upon your face<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Back into your arms<br>
<br>
<br>
Father, I'm running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
Cause I cannot go on<br>
Your child is running<br>
Father, I'm coming home<br>
I'm back where I belong<br>

<br>
Leviticus 17:7 -- NLT<br>

The people must no longer be unfaithful to the Lord by offering sacrifices to the goat idols. This is a permanent law for them, to be observed from generation to generation.<br>

<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Let's consult again are reference material which mainly includes the following two sources.<br>
We will consult The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, generally known as Strong's Concordance, which is a Bible concordance, an index of every word in the King James Version (KJV), constructed under the direction of James Strong, first published in the year of 1890.<br>
And will look at what is said in A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, by Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver, and Charles Augustus Briggs, more commonly known as Brown-Driver-Briggs or BDB (from the name of its three authors), first published in the year of 1906.<br>
<br>
In Leviticus 17:7<br>
KJV says, devils<br>
NLT said, goat demons or goat idols.<br>
What is that?<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word being used right there is pronounced, Saw-Ear.<br>
It could be pronounced a few different ways in the Hebrew.<br>
It could be pronounced, Saw-Ear, Saw-Air or Shaw-Air, with a slight rolling of the R sound at the end, perhaps.<br>
Here is what that Hebrew word can mean...<br>
faun -- which is a genetically-modified person with the body of a man and the legs and horns of a goat. It was one of the manipulated creations of the fallen watchers, and later became a rural deity worshipped by shepherds and farmers.<br>
satyr -- pronounced, Sat-Uh -- another name for a half human and half goat, a lecherous woodland god, part man, part goat, having or showing great or excessive sexual desire, especially in ways which are offensive.<br>
A hairy goat, a hairy, rough male goat.<br>
he-goat, buck, a demon in a male goat form,<br>
or having goat's feet,<br>
satyr, may refer to a demon possessed goat<br>
goat-demons; goat-idols<br>
satyr -- pronounced, Sat-Uh -- a god of the woods, with a man's face and body and a goat's legs and horns<br>
idols that Jeroboam had manufactured.<br>
King Josiah's revival probably involved the breaking down of the high places of the goat-demons, in 2 Kings 23:8.<br>
<br>
2 Kings 23:8 (NLT)<br>
Josiah brought to Jerusalem all the priests who were living in other towns of Judah. He also defiled the pagan shrines, where they had offered sacrifices -- all the way from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the shrines at the entrance to the gate of Joshua, the governor of Jerusalem. This gate was located to the left of the city gate as one enters the city.<br>

<a name="JAH34CONVOCREQD"></a><h2>Some Assembly Required</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Some Assembly Required<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:24-25<br>
KJV: And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.<br>
NLT: Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When it comes to the the assembling of ourselves together, our meeting together, there are certain days that we are required by a permanent law to gather together in an official, set-apart, holy assembly.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the NLT, there is what is called an official day for holy assembly.<br>
In the KJV, the same thing is called a holy convocation.<br>
<br>
What is identified as a permanent law in the NLT is called, in the KJV, an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.<br>
The KJV also talks about a permanent law by saying, that shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.<br>
So, the KJV ordinance for ever is called a permanent law in the NLT.<br>
The KJV may also say that a permanent law shall be a statute for ever in your generations, throughout your generations in all your dwellings.<br>
Let take a look at some official days for holy assembly and some permanent laws that are to be obeyed forever, no matter where you live.<br>
These permanent laws must be observed wherever you live, forever.<br>
It does not matter where you live right now. Wherever you live right now, you are to obey these permanent laws forever, and you should not forsake the meeting together, the assembling of ourselves together, on every official day for holy assembly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sabbath day of complete rest -- permanent law in the Ten Commandments.<br>
Every Saturday is an official day for holy assembly.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Exodus 19:8 "Remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23:3 (NLT)<br>
"You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of complete rest, an official day for holy assembly. It is the Lord's Sabbath day, and it must be observed wherever you live.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We now conclude with this final verse to think about...<br>
<br>
Leviticus 3:17 (NLT)<br>
"You must never eat any fat or blood. This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation, wherever you live."<br>
<br>
That points to a Bible study that we did a long time ago.<br>
That would be the Bible study, titled, Blood, which is in Christian Essays 10, which is the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 10.<br>
<br>
Since none of us ever could completely complete the obedience of the Torah completely, we need someone to help us complete it and accomplish all that the Torah is trying to accomplish in our lives.<br>
We need someone to complete what we could not complete, and accomplish what we could not accomplish. We need a Saviour to rescue us from our own self.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5:17 (NLT)<br>
Don't misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose.<br>
<br>
(Matthew) 5:17 (TS2009)<br>
Do not think that I came to destroy the Torah or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to complete.<br>

Commentary: Even in the areas of the Bible where the stories do not sound very happy, there are still lessons we can learn that are hiding in these stories that may not be quite so delightful to study.<br>
<br>
We have examples and stories where people made big decisions, but did not pray about it first.<br>
<br>
Before you make a big decision, pray about it first, and ask the Lord to give you wisdom and direction.<br>
Should you accept that job?<br>
Should you enter or start a business relationship with that person or business?<br>
Should you marry that person?<br>
Should you end that relationship?<br>
Should you move here or there, say yes or no, or should you sign that contract or agreement?<br>
Pray about it first.<br>
We have another example where people made big decisions but did not pray about it first.<br>
We mentioned in another Bible study about how, Lot made a decision to move somewhere, but did not pray about it first.<br>
He made the decision based on what he was physically and visually looking at only.<br>
Here is another example about some people that made a decision based on what they were looking at, but they did not pray about it.<br>
KJV: They asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.<br>
NLT: They did not consult the Lord.<br>
TS2009: They did not ask the mouth of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 20: 16 & 17 (KJV)<br>
20:16 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:<br>
20:17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 20: 16-18 (NLT)<br>
16 In those towns that the Lord your God is giving you as a special possession, destroy every living thing.<br>
17 You must completely destroy the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, just as the Lord your God has commanded you.<br>
18 This will prevent the people of the land from teaching you to imitate their detestable customs in the worship of their gods, which would cause you to sin deeply against the Lord your God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 7: 2-4 -- KJV<br>
7:2 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:<br>
7:3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.<br>
7:4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Looking at the term in the KJV, in verse 2, where it said, utterly destroy, in the NLT, they translated it as, completely destroy.<br>
Almost every time the NLT uses the term, "completely destroy," this is because, the original Hebrew language is referring to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 7: 2-4 -- NLT<br>
2 When the Lord your God hands these nations over to you and you conquer them, you must completely destroy them. Make no treaties with them and show them no mercy.<br>
3 You must not intermarry with them. Do not let your daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters,<br>
4 for they will lead your children away from me to worship other gods. Then the anger of the Lord will burn against you, and he will quickly destroy you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 7: 2-4 -- TS2009<br>
2 "And when Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem gives them over to you, you shall strike them and put them under the ban, completely. Make no covenant with them, and show them no favour.<br>
3 And do not intermarry with them – you do not give your daughter to his son, and you do not take his daughter for your son,"<br>
4 for he turns your sons away from following Me, to serve other mighty ones. Then the displeasure of Yaw-Who-Wah shall burn against you and promptly destroy you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: One day, some men just suddenly show up at Joshua's camp at Gilgal.<br>
Joshua and the people of Israel have no idea who these men are.<br>
They ask them who they are, but these men will not clearly identify themselves.<br>
Joshua does not know that these men are actually Hivites.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 9: 6-27 (reading to end of Chapter 9) -- KJV<br>
9:6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.<br>
9:7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell amongst us; and how shall we make a league with you?<br>
9:8 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?<br>
9:9 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,<br>
9:10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.<br>
<br>
9:11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying,<br>
(Take victuals in your hand for the journey,)<br>
Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.<br>
<br>
9:12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:<br>
9:13 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.<br>
(And they received the men by reason of their victuals,)<br>
9:14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.<br>
<br>
9:15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.<br>
9:16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt amongst them.<br>
9:17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.<br>
9:18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.<br>
9:19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.<br>
9:20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.<br>
9:21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.<br>
9:22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell amongst us?<br>
<br>
9:23 Now therefore ye are cursed,<br>
(and there shall not be cut off from you from being bondmen,)<br>
and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.<br>
<br>
9:24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.<br>
9:25 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.<br>
9:26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.<br>
9:27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 9: 6-27 -- NLT<br>
6 When they arrived at the camp of Israel at Gilgal, they told Joshua and the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant land to ask you to make a peace treaty with us."<br>
7 The Israelites replied to these Hivites, "How do we know you don't live nearby? For if you do, we cannot make a treaty with you."<br>
8 They replied, "We are your servants."<br>
"But who are you?" Joshua demanded. "Where do you come from?"<br>
9 They answered, "Your servants have come from a very distant country. We have heard of the might of the Lord your God and of all he did in Egypt.<br>
10 We have also heard what he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River -- King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan (who lived in Ashtaroth).<br>
11 So our elders and all our people instructed us, 'Take supplies for a long journey. Go meet with the people of Israel and tell them, "We are your servants; please make a treaty with us."'<br>
12 "This bread was hot from the ovens when we left our homes. But now, as you can see, it is dry and mouldy.<br>
13 These wineskins were new when we filled them, but now they are old and split open. And our clothing and sandals are worn out from our very long journey."<br>
14 So the Israelites examined their food, but they did not consult the Lord.<br>
15 Then Joshua made a peace treaty with them and guaranteed their safety, and the leaders of the community ratified their agreement with a binding oath.<br>
16 Three days after making the treaty, they learned that these people actually lived nearby!<br>
17 The Israelites set out at once to investigate and reached their towns in three days. The names of these towns were Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.<br>
18 But the Israelites did not attack the towns, for the Israelite leaders had made a vow to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.<br>
The people of Israel grumbled against their leaders because of the treaty.<br>
19 But the leaders replied, "Since we have sworn an oath in the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel, we cannot touch them.<br>
20 This is what we must do. We must let them live, for divine anger would come upon us if we broke our oath.<br>
21 Let them live." So they made them woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community, as the Israelite leaders directed.<br>
22 Joshua called together the Gibeonites and said, "Why did you lie to us? Why did you say that you live in a distant land when you live right here amongst us?<br>
23 May you be cursed! From now on you will always be servants who cut wood and carry water for the house of my God."<br>
24 They replied, "We did it because we -- your servants -- were clearly told that the Lord your God commanded his servant Moses to give you this entire land and to destroy all the people living in it. So we feared greatly for our lives because of you. That is why we have done this.<br>
25 Now we are at your mercy -- do to us whatever you think is right."<br>
26 So Joshua did not allow the people of Israel to kill them.<br>
27 But that day he made the Gibeonites the woodcutters and water carriers for the community of Israel and for the altar of the Lord -- wherever the Lord would choose to build it. And that is what they do to this day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 9: 6-27 -- TS2009<br>
6 And they went to Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua), to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), "We have come from a far land, and now, make a covenant with us."<br>
7 But the men of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) said to the Hiwwites, "It could be that you dwell in our midst, so how would we make a covenant with you?"<br>
8 And they said to Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua), "We are your servants." And Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua) said to them, "Who are you, and where do you come from?"<br>
9 So they said to him, "From a land very far off your servants have come, because of the Name of Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem. For we have heard the report of Him, and all that He did in Meets-Rye-EEm (Egypt),<br>
10 and all that He had done to the two sovereigns of the Amorites who were beyond the Yarden (Jordan River), to Sihon sovereign of Heshbon, and Ogg sovereign of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.<br>
11 "So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spoke to us, saying, 'Take food with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, "We are your servants, and now, make a covenant with us." '<br>
12 "This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day that we left to come to you. But now, see, it is dry and it is crumby.<br>
13 "And these wineskins which we filled were new, and see, they are torn. And these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey."<br>
14 And the men of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) took some of their food, but they did not ask the mouth of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
15 And Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua) made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live, and the rulers of the congregation swore to them.<br>
16 And it came to be at the end of three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours who dwelt near them.<br>
17 And the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Kephirah, and Be'eroth, and Qiryath Ye'arim.<br>
18 But the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) did not strike them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by Yaw-Who-Wah ELL-Low-Heem of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL). And all the congregation grumbled against the rulers.<br>
19 But all the rulers said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by Yaw-Who-Wah ELL-Low-Heem of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), and we are unable to touch them now.<br>
20 "Let us do this to them: We shall keep them alive, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them."<br>
21 And the rulers said to them, "Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the rulers had promised them."<br>
22 Then Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua) called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, "Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' yet you are dwelling in our midst?<br>
23 "And now you are cursed, and you shall not cease from being slaves, and woodcutters and drawers of water for the House of my ELL-Low-Heem."<br>
24 And they answered Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua) and said, "Your servants were clearly told that Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem commanded His servant Moe-Shay (Moses) to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. So we were very much afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this deed.<br>
25 "And now, see, we are in your hands. Do with us as it seems good and right to do to us."<br>
26 And he did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), and they did not kill them.<br>
27 And that day Yaw-Who-Shaw (Joshua) made them woodcutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the slaughter-place of Yaw-Who-Wah, even to this day, at the place that He should choose.<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 11:19 (KJV)<br>
There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 11:19 (NLT)<br>
No one in this region made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites of Gibeon. All the others were defeated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Were they really defeated? Did the children of Israel obey the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah?<br>
Let's fast-forward to the book of Judges and find out.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Judges 3: 5-7 (KJV)<br>
3:5 And the children of Israel dwelt amongst the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:<br>
3:6 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.<br>
3:7 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Judges 3: 5-7 (NLT)<br>
5 So the people of Israel lived amongst the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,<br>
6 and they intermarried with them. Israelite sons married their daughters, and Israelite daughters were given in marriage to their sons. And the Israelites served their gods.<br>
7 The Israelites did evil in the Lord's sight. They forgot about the Lord their God, and they served the images of Baal and the Asherah poles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Master Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give us wisdom, discernment and direction so that we do not go in a direction or enter into a relationship that will cause our relationship with you to be weakened or degraded. In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
Paul in Spain and England<br>
<br>
<br>
Did Paul ever go to the areas of Spain and England?<br>
He was planning to go to Spain.<br>
Paul talks about his Travel Plans in Romans 15.<br>
<br>
Romans 15:24 -- KJV<br>
15:24 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you,<br>
(if first I be somewhat filled with you.)<br>
if first I be somewhat filled with your company.<br>
<br>
Romans 15:24 -- TS2009<br>
24 I shall come to you when I go to Spain. For I expect to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 15: 23 & 24 -- NLT<br>
23 But now I have finished my work in these regions, and after all these long years of waiting, I am eager to visit you.<br>
24 I am planning to go to Spain, and when I do, I will stop off in Rome. And after I have enjoyed your fellowship for a little while, you can provide for my journey.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Acts normally goes up to Chapter 28.<br>
Paul usually ends his writings with an Amen at the end, but in the book of Acts, he did not.<br>
Could Paul's lack of the word, Amen, at the end of Acts 28 possibly suggest that, perhaps the end of Acts Chapter 28 is not really the end of the book?<br>
If that is so, then maybe Chapter 28 was not actually the last chapter of the book of Acts. Is there a lost Chapter 29 somewhere?<br>
<br>
In this Bible study, we will consider, the Acts of the Apostles Lost Chapter 29, Sonnini Manuscript.<br>
<br>
Who is Sonnini?<br>
We will gather some material now from Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia, as it was published back in February of 2024.<br>
<br>
Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt, was born in the year of 1751, and he passed away in 1812.<br>
Sonnini was a Botanist and a French naturalist, which is someone who studies the Natural history of organisms, including animals, fungi, and plants, in their natural environment, leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study.<br>
<br>
In a French publication by Sonnini, back in 1801, this copy the Acts of the Apostles chapter 29 was found.<br>
Is it real or is it fake?<br>

as of February 2024<br>
it says on this webpage that,<br>
The text made its first appearance in London in 1871.<br>
Mainstream philology considers it to most likely be a fraud.<br>
<br>
Doctor Stephen Pidgeon does not think it is a fraud, and after doing extensive research, has included it in his book, the Eth Cepher.<br>
The word, Eth, is spelled E T H, and it is pronounced, "et" as in the word, "set" but without the letter S sound.<br>
<br>
Doctor Stephen Pidgeon is a political scientist with a Doctorate of Philosophy, and a Juris Doctorate.<br>
A Juris Doctorate is a graduate-entry professional degree that primarily prepares individuals to practice law. In the United States, it is the only qualifying law degree.<br>
In collaboration with a group of students of scripture, Stephen Pidgeon is responsible for the creation and publication of the Eth Cepher.<br>
Dr Pidgeon is a student of many languages including Greek, Hebrew, Russian, French, Spanish and Italian.<br>
An avid reader and author, he has published over 30 books.<br>
His book, the Eth Cepher, is published at Cepher Publishing Group, which is at cepher.net.<br>
<br>
Stephen Pidgeon has researched the validity and historical accuracy of Acts Chapter 29, and believes it to be an original Greek copy.<br>
Here are a few things that Stephen Pidgeon said in a 2020 web log post, that help to prove this as being a valid and true chapter of the Book of Acts.<br>
You can read the entire webpage with all of his evidence presented, at the following webpage address:<br>

<br>
We will now read and quote a few selected areas from this cepher.net webpage.<br>
This webpage is part of<br>
Stephen Pidgeon's Blog.<br>
The Blog is titled,<br>
Chapter 29 – The last chapter of the Book of Acts.<br>
This webpage was published on 13 July 2020.<br>
<br>
Stephen Pidgeon is quoted on this webpage as saying,<br>
Yes, Chapter 29 was originally found in Greek.<br>
Pa'al (Paul) intended to travel into Spain.<br>
(Romans) 15:24<br>
24 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.<br>
<br>
...Acts 28, which, unlike the other Scriptures of the New Testament, does not end with the resounding Amein (Amen). This difficulty is cured with the addition of the 29th chapter.<br>
<br>
Translations which were initially created in the 1500s (the Bishop's Bible, the 1535 Tyndale, the 1537 Coverdale, the 1560 Geneva) or 1600s (the 1611 KJV-Authorised Version) necessarily would not have access to this text, given its discovery after they were published.<br>
<br>
Most translations of the 20th century are based on the forged documents used by Westcott & Hort (Codex Sinaiticus), which excluded all of the Apocrypha and did not include Acts 29, since the forger of the Codex Sinaiticus was using a 16th century Textus Receptus as a source for his document. Westcott & Hort published their New Testament in 1881, known as the Westcott and Hort text, or the WH. The Codex Sinaiticus was forged by Constantine Simonides, who repeatedly confessed his forgery in the London press for two years following the publication of the WH (the Westcott & Hort), all to no avail. He died of Leprosy in Egypt in 1890.<br>
<br>
We have several extensive proofs that Pa'al (Paul) not only visited Spain but established nearly a dozen bishopries (being in charge of a group of churches in an area) while he was there.  There is an extensive record of his visit(s) to Britain (in fact, his bones were moved to Canterbury in AD 686), and the remainder of the record set forth in Acts 29 has been well-established historically.<br>
<br>
That is the end of the selected quotations from Stephen Pidgeon's Blog.<br>
<br>
<br>
We will now read Acts 29 from godskingdom.org.<br>

We will start reading in the NLT, 5th Edition, and keep reading into Acts 29, switching from the NLT, to The Sonnini Manuscript.<br>
<br>
First, Paul Sails for Rome.<br>
There is The Storm at Sea, The Shipwreck,<br>
And then, in Acts, Chapter 28,<br>
Paul is on the Island of Malta.<br>
Paul Arrives at Rome, and then Paul Preaches at Rome under Guard.<br>
After he reads to them the Greek Version of Isaiah 6:9-10, Paul says this...<br>
28 So I want you to know that this salvation from God has also been offered to the Gentiles, and they will accept it."<br>
<br>
29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, greatly disagreeing with each other.<br>
<br>
30 For the next two years, Paul lived in Rome at his own expense.<br>
(Paul lived in Rome in his own rented quarters.)<br>
He welcomed all who visited him,<br>
31 boldly proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ. And no one tried to stop him.<br>
<br>
1 And Paul, full of the blessings of Christ and abounding in the spirit, departed out of Rome, determining to go into Spain, for he had a long time purposed to journey thitherward, and was minded also to go from thence into Britain.<br>
<br>
2 For he had heard in Phoenicia that certain of the children of Israel, about the time of the Assyrian captivity,<br>
had escaped by sea to "the isles afar off," as spoken by the prophets, (as spoken of by the Prophet Esdra) and called by the Romans, Britain.<br>
<br>
3 And the Lord commanded the gospel to be preached far hence to (the nations) the Gentiles, and to the lost sheep of the House of Israel.<br>
<br>
4 And no man hindered Paul; for he testified boldly of Jesus before the tribunes and among the people; and he took with him certain of the brethren which abode with him at Rome, and they took shipping to Ostium, and having the winds fair, were brought safely into an haven of Spain.<br>
<br>
5 And much people were gathered together from the towns and villages and the hill country; for they had heard of the conversion of the apostle and the many miracles which he had wrought.<br>
<br>
6 And Paul preached mightily in Spain, and great multitudes believed and were converted, for they perceived he was an apostle sent from God.<br>
<br>
7 And they departed out of Spain, and Paul and his company finding a ship in Armorica sailing unto Britain, they went therein, and passing along the south coast, they reached a port called Raphinus.<br>
(Raphinus is the Roman name for Sandwich, in Kent. In Saxon times there was, still standing in Sandwich, an old house called the "House of the shlichim" and tradition has it that Paulos (Paul) was one of the shlichim).<br>
(Shlichim are Israeli educators or cultural ambassadors, emissaries, who spend an extended period of time abroad to bring Israel to the community.)<br>
<br>
8 Now when it was noised abroad that the apostle had landed on their coast, great multitudes of the inhabitants met him, and they treated Paul courteously; and he entered in at the east gate of their city and lodged in the house of an Hebrew and one of his own nation.<br>
<br>
9 And on the morrow he came and stood upon Mount Lud [now Ludgate Hill and Broadway, where St. Paul's Cathedral is built in London];<br>
(Ludgate Hill and Broadway is where St. Paulos's Cathedral stands in London, England)<br>
(Ludgate Hill is a hill in the City of London, near the old Ludgate, a gate to the City that was taken down in 1780.)<br>
<br>
and the people thronged at the gate and assembled in the Broadway; and he preached Christ unto them, and many believed the word and the testimony of Jesus.<br>
<br>
10 And at even the Holy Ghost fell upon Paul, and he prophesied, saying, "Behold, in the last days the God of Peace shall dwell in the cities, and the inhabitants thereof shall be numbered; and in the seventh numbering of the people, their eyes shall be opened and the glory of their inheritance shine forth before them. And nations shall come up to worship on the Mount that testifieth of the patience and long suffering of a servant of the Lord.<br>
<br>
11 And in the latter days new tidings of the Gospel shall issue forth out of Jerusalem, and the hearts of the people shall rejoice, and behold, fountains shall be opened and there shall be no more plague.<br>
<br>
12 In those days there shall be wars and rumours of wars; and a King shall rise up, and His sword shall be for the healing of the nations, and His peace-making shall abide, and the glory of His Kingdom a wonder among princes."<br>
<br>
13 And it came to pass that certain of the Druids came unto Paul privately and showed by their rites and ceremonies they were descended from the Judahites which escaped from the bondage in the land of Egypt; and the apostle believed these things, and he gave them the kiss of peace.<br>
<br>
14 And Paul abode in his lodgings three months, confirming in the faith and preaching Christ continually.<br>
<br>
15 And after these things, Paul and his brethren departed from Raphinus, (the Roman name for Sandwich,) and sailed unto Atium in Gaul.<br>
<br>
16 And Paul preached in the Roman garrisons and among the people, exhorting all men to repent and confess their sins.<br>
<br>
(The Belgae were a large confederation of tribes living in northern Gaul, between the English Channel and the west bank of the Rhine, from at least the third century BC. They were discussed in depth by Julius Caesar in his account of his wars in Gaul.)<br>
<br>
17 And there came to him certain of the Belgae to enquire of him of the new doctrine and of the man Jesus; and Paul opened his heart unto them and told them all things that had befallen Him, how be it that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; and they departed, pondering among themselves upon the things which they had heard.<br>
<br>
18 And after much preaching and toil, Paul and his fellow labourers passed into Helvetia [now Switzerland] and came unto Mount Pontius Pilate, where he who condemned the Lord Jesus dashed himself down headlong and so miserably perished.<br>
<br>
19 And immediately a torrent gushed out of the mountain and washed his body, broken in pieces, into a lake.<br>
<br>
20 And Paul stretched forth his hands upon the water and prayed unto the Lord, saying, "O Lord God, give a sign unto all nations that here Pontius Pilate, which condemned Thine only begotten Son, plunged headlong into the pit."<br>
<br>
21 And while Paul was yet speaking, behold, there came a great earthquake, and the face of the waters was changed, and the form of the lake like unto the Son of Man hanging in an agony upon the cross.<br>
<br>
22 And a voice came out of heaven, saying, "Even Pilate hath escaped the wrath to come, for he washed his hands before the multitude at the blood shedding of the Lord Jesus."<br>
<br>
23 When, therefore, Paul and those that were with him saw the earthquake and heard the voice of the angel, they glorified God and were mightily strengthened in spirit.<br>
<br>
24 And they journeyed and came to Mount Julius, where stood two pillars, one on the right hand and one on the left hand, erected by Caesar Augustus.<br>
<br>
25 And Paul, filled with the Holy Ghost, stood up between the two pillars, saying, "Men and brethren, these stones which you see this day shall testify of my journey hence; and verily I say, they shall remain until the outpouring of the Spirit upon all nations, neither shall the way be hindered throughout all generations."<br>
<br>
26 And they went forth and came unto Illyricum, intending to go by Macedonia into Asia, and grace was found in all the churches; and they prospered and had peace. Amen.<br>

1 Samuel 17: 41-43 -- NLT<br>
41 Goliath walked out toward David with his shield bearer ahead of him,<br>
42 sneering in contempt at this ruddy-faced boy.<br>
43 "Am I a dog," he roared at David, "that you come at me with a stick?" And he cursed David by the names of his gods.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Goliath was a Philistine giant that may have been 7 to 9 feet tall, which is about 2 or 3 metres tall.<br>
His protective armour, known as a bronze coat of mail, weighed 125 pounds, or 57 kilograms.<br>
His spear was tipped with an iron spearhead that weighed 15 pounds, which is almost 7 kilograms.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 17: 48-53 -- NLT<br>
48 As Goliath moved closer to attack, David quickly ran out to meet him.<br>
49 Reaching into his shepherd's bag and taking out a stone, he hurled it with his sling and hit the Philistine in the forehead. The stone sank in, and Goliath stumbled and fell face down on the ground.<br>
50 So David triumphed over the Philistine with only a sling and a stone, for he had no sword.<br>
51 Then David ran over and pulled Goliath's sword from its sheath. David used it to kill him and cut off his head.<br>
When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they turned and ran.<br>
52 Then the men of Israel and Judah gave a great shout of triumph and rushed after the Philistines,<br>
(chasing them as far as a valley)<br>
chasing them as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron. The bodies of the dead and wounded Philistines were strewn all along the road from Shaaraim, as far as Gath and Ekron.<br>
53 Then the Israelite army returned and plundered the deserted Philistine camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion. David killed Goliath.<br>
<br>
Even though all Bible translations can have some amount of inaccuracies, some wrong and fake religions will make a fake and wrong Bible to go along with the lies that they teach in their religion.<br>
<br>
One verse that fake religions love to change is this one...<br>
<br>
John 1:1 -- KJV: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>
<br>
The Word was God.<br>
If you have a Bible, and this verse ends with, and the Word was a God, if it says,<br>
the Word was A God, then you can throw that Bible away, or use that paper to help start your next fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
For those that love to pray to and worship the whore of Babylon woman riding on the beast in the book of Revelation,<br>
the woman that is holding up a cup in her hand, in order to worship this woman as a god, here is a verse that they love to change...<br>
<br>
<br>
Then the Lord God said to the serpent,<br>
Genesis 3:15 -- KJV<br>
And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 3:15 -- NLT<br>
And I will cause hostility between you and the woman,<br>
and between your offspring and her offspring.<br>
(He will bruise your head,)<br>
He will strike your head,<br>
and you will strike his heel."<br>
<br>
Those that love to pray to that woman and worship that woman, they will change the pronouns in this verse into something like this...<br>
I will put enmities between you and the woman, between your offspring and her offspring. She will crush your head, and you will lie in wait for her heel."<br>
<br>
If you have a Bible, and instead of it saying, his heel, it says, her heel, you can throw that Bible away, or use that paper to help start your next fire.<br>
<br>
But even the original Hebrew copies that made the good and trusted KJV can have some little problems too. Here is one.<br>
<br>
In 2 Samuel 21, we read about there being Battles against four Philistine Giants.<br>
2 Samuel 21:19 -- KJV<br>
21:19	And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,<br>
where Elhanan the son of (Jair) Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite,<br>
slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite,<br>
the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.<br>
<br>
Commentary: In the KJV, the brother, is in italics, which means that, the brother, was added by the KJV translation team.<br>
In the original Hebrew, the brother was not there.<br>
It was added by the KJV team which is why it is in italics.<br>
Take away the italic words, and it says,<br>
Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew Goliath.<br>
<br>
The story is corrected when it is told again in<br>
the book of 1 Chronicles.<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 20:5 -- KJV<br>
20:5	And there was war again with the Philistines; <br>
and Elhanan the son of Jair (Jaareoregim) slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,<br>
whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.<br>
<br>
The NLT also corrected this spot in 2 Samuel 21:19, but they mention in the margin notes that the Hebrew did not say, the brother.<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 21:19 -- NLT<br>
During another battle at Gob, Elhanan son of Jair (son of Jaare-oregim) from Bethlehem killed the brother of Goliath of Gath. The handle of his spear was as thick as a weaver's beam!<br>
<br>
Again, the NLT team does point out in their margin notes that,<br>
In 2 Samuel 21:19, the Hebrew reads, Elhanan son of Jair killed Goliath of Gath.<br>
<br>
And, once again, 1 Chronicles 20:5 tells it right...<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 20:5 -- NLT<br>
During another battle with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath of Gath. The handle of Lahmi's spear was as thick as a weaver's beam!<br>
<br>
<br>
So, there can be some Bibles that contain this problem.<br>
The problem is left as is, in the Geneva Bible.<br>
2 Samuel 21:19 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
And there was yet another battle in Gob with the Philistims, where Elhanah the son of Iaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite slew Goliath the Gittite: the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.<br>
<br>
So, some may fix this, and some may leave it as is.<br>
Only by reading your entire Bible, will you eventually read the corrected version of this story, later on, in 1 Chronicles.<br>
<br>
By the way, another detail about some of the giants is that some of them had 12 fingers and 12 toes.<br>
2 Samuel 21:20 -- KJV<br>
And there was yet a battle in Gath,<br>
where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers,<br>
and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number;<br>
and he (Rapha) also was born to the giant.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 21:20 -- NLT<br>
In another battle with the Philistines at Gath, they encountered (a Midianite,) a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all, who was also a descendant of the giants.<br>
<br>
This area talks about four of these Philistines, which were descendants of the giants of Gath, but David and his warriors killed them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As much as I might enjoy using the NLT, 5th Edition,<br>
all English translations can have problems and technical mistakes,<br>
and translation inaccuracies in the precision of how well the translation was done.<br>
Here is one example of the NLT failing to translate a verse accurately.<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 24:1 -- NLT<br>
1 Once again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel,<br>
and he caused David to harm them by taking a census.<br>
"Go and count the people of Israel and Judah," the Lord told him.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
It sounds like the Lord told him to do this, and then the Lord<br>
punishes him later for doing it, by sending a plague upon Israel<br>
which results in a total of 70,000 people dying.<br>
Hey NLT team! That makes no sense at all!<br>
Why would the Lord tell David to do something, and then punish him for obeying?<br>
The part that fails is the pronoun, "he."<br>
<br>
The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) also does this...<br>
2 Samuel 24:1 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
And again the displeasure of Yaw-Who-Wah burned against Yis-Rye-eLL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), and moved Dawid against them to say, "Go, number Yis-Rye-eLL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) and Yah-Who-duh."<br>
<br>
<br>
If we go to the KJV, let's see what it says there.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 24:1 -- KJV<br>
24:1	And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,<br>
(and Satan moved David against them)<br>
and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.<br>
<br>
If your KJV does not have the margin notes, you would not see this.<br>
The word, Satan, is in the KJV, but only in the margin notes.<br>
So, if your KJV does not have the margin notes, it also can fail to translate this verse.<br>
<br>
In the previous chapter, Chapter 20, David and his warriors had just gotten done winning many battles, and having all kinds of victory and success.<br>
There must have been some kind of spiritual issue, or some kind of pride, going on for Yaw-Who-Wah to allow satan to influence David to move against the people.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 24:1 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
And the wrath of the Lord was again kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, in that he said, Go, number Israel and Judah.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The same story is also told in the book of 1 Chronicles.<br>
1 Chronicles 21:1 -- KJV<br>
21:1	And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 21:1 -- NLT<br>
Satan rose up against Israel and caused David to take a census of the people of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
I don't know why these areas towards the end of the book of 2 Samuel have some problems,<br>
but I'm glad we also have 1 Chronicles to tell us these same stories, and to set the record straight.<br>
That's why it's always good to read your entire Bible from cover to cover,<br>
so if one area is not quite clear, there can be other areas to help us pull out a better understanding.<br>
Read your entire Bible from cover to cover.<br>
And, if you are reading the NLT, 5th Edition, always, always read the footnotes and margin notes.<br>
If more than five years have now gone by since the last time you were reading your entire Bible, from cover to cover, then it is time for you to do it again.<br>
Read your Bible and pray, every single day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Wisdom and advice and directions that are delivered to us can contain content that may originate from any of these six sources...<br>
<br>
1. From the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, speaking to us through somebody, very young, very old, rich or poor, high or low, pretty and prestigious or appearing lowly and worthless.<br>
2. One's personal mental and cognitive thinking and mental thought processes from the mind, leaning on one's own understanding.<br>
3. One's feelings and emotions from the heart.<br>
4. One's memories from personal past experiences.<br>
5. From repeating patterns and traditions, we do this or that custom or tradition because it is what we always do at this time every year. We always do this Step 3 because it is always traditionally done after that Step 2.<br>
6. From what the world teaches us, the worldly rules and expectations, and worldly procedures as dictated by culture, society, and the worldly standards of what is good, evil, right, wrong, important or not important, valuable or worthless.<br>
<br>
Only one of these six sources is really good and trustworthy. When someone gives you advice, where is that advice coming from?<br>
When you give comments and advice out to others, where are those ideas and comments and bits of advice coming from?<br>
Which one of these six sources are piloting the conversation?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One final thing to also think about is this.<br>
Remembering a verse that we looked at in the Bible study, titled, Fruitful,<br>
which was back in Christian Essays 8, the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 8...<br>
<br>
James 3: 16-18 -- KJV<br>
(For where envying and strife is, there is tumult or unquietness.)<br>
3:16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.<br>
3:17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle,<br>
and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,<br>
(without wrangling,)<br>
without partiality, and without hypocrisy.<br>
3:18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.<br>
<br>
James 3: 16-18 -- NLT<br>
16 For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind.<br>
17 wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and the fruit of good deeds. It shows no favouritism and is always sincere.<br>
18 And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness, (a harvest of good things, and a harvest of justice).<br>
<br>
Commentary: Wisdom from above. If it is really true and genuine, and if it really is wisdom from above, it will feel like that.<br>
It has a feeling of being pure, and it has a feeling of peace.<br>
If it's feeling the opposite of that, and the Holy Spirit is flashing red lights, and sounding off alarms in your heart,<br>
that check in your spirit could be the Holy Spirit warning you that, the advice you are receiving, might sometimes be good advice for someone else, sometimes, but it may not be true for you and your particular situation, and His plan that He has for your life.<br>
The Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth, and the Holy Spirit will guide you away from all lies and strong delusions.<br>
So, if what you are receiving is feeling good and right, as described here in James 3, then it is most likely the truth, streaming to you straight from Heaven's Throne Room.<br>
And, if it feels kind of, off, or wrong, then the Holy Spirit might be warning you about something that is false, or does not apply to you.<br>
What might be right for you, may not be right for someone else.<br>
What might have been good and right for someone else, may not be true or good or right for you, and your particular life and circumstances right now.<br>
Let the Holy Spirit guide you, and pray about it, and pray about the way how it feels, so you will know for sure.<br>

Commentary:<br>
When Jesus came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on the Saturday Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures.<br>
The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and read Isaiah 61:1-2, Greek version, and Isaiah 58:6.<br>
We have studied this before when we were in a random Bible study in Christian Essays 5.<br>
And we were reading this again in the Bible study, titled, Mourning, which is at the beginning of Christian Essays 6.<br>
Here is one verse from that reading...<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 4:18 -- KJV<br>
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor;<br>
he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives,<br>
and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,<br>
<br>
Luke 4:18 -- NLT<br>
"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br>
for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor.<br>
He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released,<br>
that the blind will see,<br>
that the oppressed will be set free,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 6:16 -- KJV<br>
6:16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls....<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 6:16 -- TS2009<br>
16 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, "Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; and find rest for yourselves....<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 6:16 -- NLT<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Stop at the crossroads and look around.<br>
Ask for the old, Godly way, and walk in it.<br>
Travel its path, and you will find rest for your souls....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 11: 28-30 -- KJV<br>
11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<br>
11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<br>
11:30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 13:15 -- KJV<br>
13:15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 11: 28-30 -- TS2009<br>
28 "Come to Me, all you who labour and are burdened, and I shall give you rest.<br>
29 "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and humble in heart, and you shall find rest for your beings<br>
30 "For My yoke is gentle and My burden is light."<br>
<br>
Proverbs 13:15 -- TS2009<br>
15 Good understanding gains favour, But the way of the treacherous is hard.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 11: 28-30 -- NLT<br>
28 Then Jesus said, "Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.<br>
29 Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls.<br>
30 For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light."<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 13:15 -- NLT<br>
A person with good sense is respected;<br>
a treacherous person is headed for destruction.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
A way of thinking about a yoke, figuratively, is that it is a coupling, that is, figuratively, servitude, law (Torah) or obligation.<br>
It can literally be the beam of the balance, as connecting the scales, which is why the symbol of judgement and justice use a balance of scales, weighing right from wrong, good and evil.<br>
Christ's commands must be submitted to, though easier to be kept.<br>
His way is easy, but the way of the transgressor is hard.<br>
<br>
<br>
In just a moment, we will look up a word, using our usual set of reference books.<br>
We have mentioned the titles of the reference books several times before.<br>
Since we will be looking up a word in the New Testament,<br>
we will be using, here in just a moment, the following references to look up a Greek word in the New Testament...<br>

Matthew 28: 18-20 -- KJV -- the last three verses at the very end of the Book of Matthew...<br>
28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.<br>
28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br>
28:20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 28: 18-20 -- TS2009<br>
18 And Yaw-Who-Shaw came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.<br>
19 Therefore, go and make taught ones of all the nations, immersing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Set-apart Spirit,<br>
20 teaching them to guard all that I have commanded you. And see, I am with you always, until the end of the age." Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 28: 18-20 (NLT) -- the last three verses at the very end of the Book of Matthew...<br>
18 Jesus came and told his disciples, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth.<br>
19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations (go and make disciples of all peoples), baptising them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.<br>
20 Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: We are hereby commanded not just to believe, but to teach.<br>
We are commanded to make disciples. We do not just make people become believers, we make disciples.<br>
<br>
We will now consult those reference books to look up a word that we saw there in,<br>
Matthew 28, verse 19, where it says to<br>
make taught ones and make disciples<br>
that Greek word right there is pronounced,<br>
Mah-Fee-Teh-Voh<br>
and it means,<br>
to be pupil<br>
I make disciples, make into disciples<br>
I make a disciple of, train in discipleship; I am trained, discipled, instructed.<br>
to be a disciple<br>
to make a disciple<br>
to be a disciple of one<br>
to follow his precepts and instructions<br>
to teach, instruct<br>
to become a pupil<br>
enrol as scholar<br>
<br>
If we go to the<br>
Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries, back in March of 2024,<br>
here are the Dictionary definitions for<br>
disciple<br>
a disciple is<br>
someone who believes in the ideas of a great teacher or leader, especially a religious one.<br>
someone who believes in, and follows, the teachings of another.<br>
A disciple is a person who believes in the ideas and principles of someone famous and tries to live the way that person does or did.<br>
If you are someone's disciple, you are influenced by their teachings and try to follow their example.<br>
A disciple is a person who believes in and follows the teachings of a religious or political leader.<br>
(According to the Bible,) this would be one of the people who followed Jesus Christ and his teachings when he was living on earth, especially one of the twelve apostles.<br>
<br>
What is an apostle?<br>
an apostle is a proponent.<br>
An apostle is someone who believes strongly in an idea and tries to persuade other people about it.<br>

An apostle is a person who strongly believes in a policy or an idea and tries to make other people believe in it.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
We need to be an apostle that makes disciples.<br>
We need to be a disciple.<br>
We need to learn of Him and follow Him.<br>
Are you one of His disciples, one of His taught ones?<br>
How can you tell if you are one of His disciples, one of His taught ones?<br>
Here is a way of knowing if you really are one of His disciples, one of His taught ones.<br>
And, here is what will happen to you as a result of being one of His disciples, one of His taught ones...<br>
<br>
<br>
John 8: verses 30 to 32, and verse 36 -- KJV<br>
8:30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.<br>
8:31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;<br>
8:32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.<br>
8:36 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 8: verses 30, 31, 32, and verse 36 -- TS2009<br>
30 As He was speaking these words, many believed in Him.<br>
31 So Yaw-Who-Shaw said to those Yeh-Who-Deem who believed Him, "If you stay in My Word, you are truly My taught ones,<br>
32 and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."<br>
36 "If, then, the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 8: from verse 30 to 32, and verse 36 -- NLT<br>
30 Then many who heard him say these things believed in him.<br>
31 Jesus said to the people who believed in him, "You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings.<br>
32 And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."<br>
36 So if the Son sets you free, you are truly free.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We talked a little bit about a group known as, Devoted To Yah, when we were in<br>
Christian Essays 20, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 20.<br>
We mentioned at that time that,<br>
Darionel Serrano created a band and Bible study group, known as, Devoted To Yah.<br>
When we previously mentioned Devoted To Yah, back in<br>
December 2020, Devoted To Yah had released about 11 different songs, mainly from 2015 to 2018.<br>
When we checked again, as of March 2024, he now has over 16 songs.<br>
His video Bible teachings, music videos and other music tracks were all available for free download on his Official Website, at<br>
<a href="https://devotedtoyah.wordpress.com/">https://devotedtoyah.wordpress.com/</a><br>
He also publishes his teachings and recordings at several other video sharing platform websites.<br>
<br>
He also does a Sabbath Fellowship on Saturday, and a Sunday Fellowship,<br>
which can be watched live, online every week.<br>
Between his Official Website and his YouTube channel, Devoted To Yah publishes<br>
Music videos<br>
Music<br>
Bible studies and Torah studies about<br>
True Repentance,<br>
Messianic Oneness Theology,<br>
Debates/Discussions,<br>
The True Name of God (From LORD, Yehovah Jehovah Yahweh Yahuah Jesus Joshua Yeshua Yahusha),<br>
and videos about, Why we left Christianity and pagan Christianity.<br>
<br>
One song that he released in December of 2023 was titled,<br>
Meant To Be Free<br>
<br>
The audio track<br>
Premiered on 11 December 2023, and it is titled,<br>
Devoted To Yah - Meant To Be FREE (official release)<br>
<br>
The music video was<br>
uploaded to YouTube on 22 December 2023, and it is titled,<br>
Devoted To Yah - Meant To Be FREE (recorded in Time Square NYC)<br>
<br>
Two words that he uses in his rap, are the words, soffit, and, Anarchy.<br>
Let's look up those words in the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries, in March of 2024...<br>
<br>
A soffit is the underneath part of the edge of a roof, where it meets the side of the building.<br>
It is also the under-surface of an arch, the underside of a stair, the underside of the top of a door or window opening, etc.<br>
So, when he says,<br>
"I will not resist there's no need to fight<br>
the law and the prophets a house and it's soffit"<br>
I think that he means that we are not underneath all that, we are not under the law, we are not fastened beneath the law.<br>
We are set free from the law of sin and death.<br>
We are set free. We are free to trust, believe, follow and obey Him, and live our lives for Him.<br>
<br>
Anarchy is confusion and lack of order of any kind, the absence of law, the lack of a ruler.<br>
Anarchy is confusion. Our ELL-Low Heem is not the author of confusion. Our ELL-Low-Heem does everything decently and in order, doing it His way, not our way.<br>
If you describe a situation as anarchy, you mean that nobody seems to be paying any attention to rules or laws.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Hearing the sounds of birds singing is just not something you can easily hear when standing in New York City.<br>
In the recording and in his artwork for this release, it starts with the sounds of New York City, which is like being in a birdcage,<br>
and suddenly switches to sounds of birds singing freely and moving about freely in a forest.<br>
It's kind of like the opening of the birdcage, letting the birds be set free.<br>
This is what Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw has done for you and for me.<br>
The Son makes you free, and you shall be free indeed.<br>
Some glad morning, when this life is over, I will fly away, free as a bird.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2023 song, Meant To Be Free, by, Devoted To Yah...<br>
<br>
<br>
Woah Woah<br>
Woah Woah<br>

Freedom ain't free without boundaries<br>
I cannot live my life how I please<br>
Now I see the power He<br>
Has given by His spirit cus He's risen and alive in me<br>
<br>
I was captive to my own corruption<br>
locked in trapped in cognitive distortions<br>
then Yahuah came through with the master key<br>

The wages of sin You have satisfied<br>

We had mentioned the musical artist, Crowder, back when we were in<br>
Christian Essays 4, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 4.<br>
<br>
Crowder was the lead vocalist of the David Crowder Band<br>
that started in 1996 and disbanded in 2012<br>
when Crowder started his solo career.<br>
<br>
<br>
As of March 2024, according to the information found about him on Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia,<br>
<br>
David Wallace Crowder just goes by his stage name, Crowder, since 2012.<br>
Crowder is an American contemporary Christian music singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and author.<br>
<br>
As of March of 2024, he had five albums as the solo artist, Crowder.<br>
<br>
<br>
On 9 November 2023 Crowder released the single, Grave Robber.<br>
<br>
The Grave Robber music video Premiered on 23 February 2024.<br>
<br>
This song was one of the popular songs on Christian music charts in March of 2024, one of the popular songs playing on Christian music radio stations.<br>
It was the only song in the Top 20 at that time that had more of a hard and gritty, Christian Rock sound,<br>
very much like the Christian Rock songs that were popular at the start of the 21st Century (back in the early noughties, the years of 2000 to 2005, approximately).<br>
<br>
As of March of 2024, this single was not yet available on any album.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2023 song, Grave Robber, from Crowder.<br>
<br>
<br>
I used to live like a rebel<br>
Didn't wanna behave<br>
Thought a wretch like me couldn't ever be saved<br>
But everything changed, I remember the day<br>
When I heard Him calling my name<br>
<br>
Like a thief in the night<br>
He snuck in, took my life<br>
I was dead now I'm alive and singing<br>
<br>
I got stolen by the grave robber<br>
Picked me up from that rock bottom<br>
Washed my soul in that Holy water<br>
Brought me back to life<br>
One more stone rolled away<br>
One more sinner been saved by grace<br>
This dead man, he ain't dead no longer<br>
All because of that grave robber<br>
<br>
Maybe you're the one thinking<br>
That you'll never be right<br>
Even though your momma praying for you every night<br>
Praying Jesus gonna find you and open your eyes<br>
Well maybe right now's that time<br>
<br>
Like a thief in the night<br>
He'll sneak in, take your life<br>
That resurrection gonna have you singing<br>
<br>
I got stolen by the grave robber<br>
Picked me up from that rock bottom<br>
Washed my soul in that Holy water<br>
Brought me back to life<br>
One more stone rolled away<br>
One more sinner been saved by grace<br>
This dead man, he ain't dead no longer<br>
All because of that grave robber<br>
<br>
Taking my sin, taking my shame<br>
Breaking my soul out of these chains<br>
I'm a dead man living<br>
And God did it<br>
Taking my sin, taking my shame<br>
Breaking my soul out of these chains<br>
I've been forgiven<br>
And God did it<br>
<br>
I got stolen by the grave robber<br>
Picked me up from that rock bottom<br>
Washed my soul in that Holy water<br>
Brought me back to life<br>
<br>
Oh, I got stolen by the grave robber<br>
Picked me up from that rock bottom<br>
Washed my soul in that Holy water<br>
Brought me back to life<br>
Brought me back to life<br>
One more stone rolled away<br>
One more sinner been saved by grace<br>
This dead man, he ain't dead no longer<br>
All because of that grave robber<br>
<br>
Jesus is the rock and he rolls my grave away<br>
All because of that grave robber<br>
Jesus is the rock and he -<br>
All because of that grave robber<br>

Here are some Psalms that we have studied several times before, in several different Bible studies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 49 -- All of Psalms 49, all 20 verses -- KJV<br>
<br>
49:1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:<br>
49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.<br>
49:3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.<br>
49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.<br>
49:5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?<br>
49:6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;<br>
49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:<br>
49:8 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)<br>
49:9 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.<br>
49:10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.<br>
(Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to generation and generation;)<br>
49:11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.<br>
<br>
49:12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.<br>
(This their way is their folly: yet their posterity delight in their mouth.)<br>
49:13 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.<br>
<br>
49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;<br>
and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.<br>
(and their strength shall consume in the grave being an habitation to every one of them.)<br>
(But God will redeem my soul from the hand of the grave:)<br>
(But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell:)<br>
49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.<br>
<br>
49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;<br>
49:17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.<br>
(Though in his life he blessed his soul:)<br>
49:18 Though whilst he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.<br>
(The soul shall go to the generation of his fathers;)<br>
49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.<br>
<br>
49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.<br>
<br>
<br>
In verse 13, the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.<br>

and my thoughts are filled with insight.<br>
4<br>
I listen carefully to many proverbs<br>
and solve riddles with inspiration from a harp.<br>
5<br>
Why should I fear when trouble comes,<br>
when enemies surround me?<br>
6<br>
They trust in their wealth<br>
and boast of great riches.<br>
7<br>
Yet they cannot redeem themselves from death<br>
by paying a ransom to God.<br>
(No one can redeem the life of another.)<br>
<br>
<br>
8<br>
Redemption does not come so easily,<br>
for no one can ever pay enough<br>
9<br>
to live forever<br>
and never see the grave.<br>
10<br>
Those who are wise must finally die,<br>
just like the foolish and senseless,<br>
leaving all their wealth behind.<br>
<br>
<br>
11<br>
(Their inward is their eternal home,)<br>
(Their inward thought is their eternal home,)<br>
The grave is their eternal home,<br>
where they will stay forever.<br>
They may name their estates after themselves,<br>
<br>
<br>
12<br>
but their fame will not last.<br>
They will die, just like animals.<br>
13<br>
This is the fate of fools,<br>
though they are remembered as being wise.<br>
<br>
Interlude<br>
<br>
14<br>
(Like sheep, they are led to Sheol,)<br>
Like sheep, they are led to the grave,<br>
where death will be their shepherd.<br>
In the morning the godly will rule over them.<br>
Their bodies will rot in the grave,<br>
far from their grand estates.<br>
<br>
<br>
15<br>
But as for me, God will redeem my life.<br>
He will snatch me from the power of the grave.<br>
<br>
Interlude<br>
<br>
16<br>
So don't be dismayed when the wicked grow rich<br>
and their homes become ever more splendid.<br>
17<br>
For when they die, they take nothing with them.<br>
Their wealth will not follow them into the grave.<br>
18<br>
In this life they consider themselves fortunate<br>
and are applauded for their success.<br>
19<br>
But they will die like all before them<br>
and never again see the light of day.<br>
20<br>
People who boast of their wealth don't understand;<br>
they will die, just like animals.<br>
<br>
<br>

I don't know why this date was written down, or what was so special or different about this date.<br>
On the evening of Tuesday, the 17th of October, 2023, my wife was singing part of Psalms 68,<br>
and my daughter was sharing with us Psalms 38:12, and Psalms 36.<br>
When I was reading through the book of Psalms again in the NLT, 5th Edition, back in March of 2024,<br>
I found myself deeply fascinated and focused on Psalms 38:12 again, wanting to read that verse several times.<br>
I don't know why, but it felt like it was very important, and I would understand why it is so important,<br>
some other day in the future.<br>
I'm thankful for every one of those moments with my family. They are always very precious and important.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 38:12 -- KJV<br>
They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.<br>
<br>
Psalms 38:12 -- NLT<br>
Meanwhile, my enemies lay traps to kill me.<br>
Those who wish me harm make plans to ruin me.<br>
All day long they plan their treachery.<br>
<br>
Psalms 38:12 -- TS2009<br>
And those seeking my life lay a snare; And those seeking my evil have spoken of destruction, And utter deceit all day long.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All of Psalms 36, All 12 verses -- KJV<br>
36:1 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.<br>
<br>
36:2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.<br>
(to find his iniquity to hate.)<br>
36:3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.<br>
(He deviseth vanity upon his bed;)<br>
36:4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.<br>
<br>
36:5 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.<br>
(Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God;)<br>
36:6 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgements are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.<br>
(How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God!)<br>
36:7 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.<br>
<br>
36:8 They shall be (watered and) abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.<br>
<br>
36:9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.<br>
(O draw out at length thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee;)<br>
36:10 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.<br>
<br>
36:11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.<br>
36:12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.<br>

For the choir director: A psalm of David, the servant of the Lord.<br>
<br>
(Sin whispers to the wicked, deep in his heart.)<br>
(Sin whispers to the wicked, deep in my heart.)<br>
1<br>
Sin whispers to the wicked, deep within their hearts.<br>
They have no fear of God at all.<br>
2<br>
In their blind conceit,<br>
they cannot see how wicked they really are.<br>
3<br>
Everything they say is crooked and deceitful.<br>
They refuse to act wisely or do good.<br>
4<br>
They lie awake at night, hatching sinful plots.<br>
Their actions are never good.<br>
They make no attempt to turn from evil.<br>
5<br>
Your unfailing love, O Lord, is as vast as the heavens;<br>
your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds.<br>
6<br>
Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains,<br>
your justice like the ocean depths.<br>
You care for people and animals alike, O Lord.<br>
7<br>
How precious is your unfailing love, O God!<br>
All humanity finds shelter<br>
in the shadow of your wings.<br>
8<br>
You feed them from the abundance of your own house,<br>
letting them drink from your river of delights.<br>
9<br>
For you are the fountain of life,<br>
the light by which we see.<br>
10<br>
Pour out your unfailing love on those who love you;<br>
give justice to those with honest hearts.<br>
11<br>
Don't let the proud trample me<br>
or the wicked push me around.<br>
12<br>
Look! Those who do evil have fallen!<br>
They are thrown down, never to rise again.<br>

All of Psalms 68 -- All 35 verses -- KJV<br>
<br>
68:1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.<br>

68:2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.<br>
<br>
68:3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.<br>
(let them rejoice with gladness.)<br>

68:6 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.<br>
<br>
68:7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:<br>
68:8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.<br>
(Thou, O God, didst shake out a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm it, thine inheritance, when it was weary.)<br>
68:9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.<br>
<br>
68:10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.<br>
<br>
68:11 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.<br>
(great was the army of those that published it.)<br>
(Kings of armies did flee, did flee:)<br>
68:12 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.<br>
<br>
68:13 Though ye have lien amongst the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.<br>
(When the Almighty scattered kings for her, she was white as snow in Salmon.)<br>
68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.<br>
<br>
68:15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.<br>
68:16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.<br>
<br>
68:17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: (even many thousands of angels:) the Lord is amongst them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.<br>
<br>
68:18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:<br>
thou hast received gifts for men;<br>
(thou hast received gifts in the man;)<br>
yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell amongst them.<br>
<br>
68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.<br>
68:20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.<br>
68:21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.<br>
68:22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:<br>
(That thy foot may be red in the blood of thine enemies,)<br>
68:23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.<br>
<br>
68:24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.<br>
68:25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; amongst them were the damsels playing with timbrels.<br>
<br>
68:26 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.<br>
(Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, ye that are of the fountain of Israel.)<br>
68:27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler,<br>
(the princes of Judah with their company,)<br>
the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.<br>
<br>
68:28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.<br>
68:29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.<br>
(Rebuke the beast of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls,)<br>
68:30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver:<br>
scatter thou the people that delight in war.<br>
(he scattereth the people that delight in war.)<br>
68:31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.<br>
68:32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:<br>
<br>
68:33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old;<br>
lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.<br>
(lo, he doth give his voice, and that a mighty voice.)<br>
68:34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.<br>
(and his strength is in the heavens.)<br>
68:35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.<br>

All of Psalms 68 -- All 35 verses -- NLT, 5th Edition<br>
For the choir director: A song. A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
Rise up, O God, and scatter your enemies.<br>
Let those who hate God run for their lives.<br>
2<br>
Blow them away like smoke.<br>
Melt them like wax in a fire.<br>
Let the wicked perish in the presence of God.<br>
3<br>
But let the godly rejoice.<br>
Let them be glad in God's presence.<br>
Let them be filled with joy.<br>
4<br>
Sing praises to God and to his name!<br>
Sing loud praises to him who rides the clouds.<br>
(Sing loud praises to him who rides through the deserts.)<br>
His name is the Lord --<br>
rejoice in his presence!<br>
5<br>
Father to the fatherless, defender of widows --<br>
this is God, whose dwelling is holy.<br>
6<br>
God places the lonely in families;<br>
he sets the prisoners free and gives them joy.<br>
But he makes the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.<br>
7<br>
O God, when you led your people out from Egypt,<br>
when you marched through the dry wasteland,<br>
<br>
Interlude<br>
<br>
8<br>
the earth trembled, and the heavens poured down rain<br>
before you, the God of Sinai,<br>
before God, the God of Israel.<br>
9<br>
You sent abundant rain, O God,<br>
to refresh the weary land.<br>
10<br>
There your people finally settled,<br>
and with a bountiful harvest, O God,<br>
you provided for your needy people.<br>
(The Lord gives the word, and a host of women brings the good news.)<br>
11<br>
The Lord gives the word,<br>
and a great army brings the good news.<br>
12<br>
Enemy kings and their armies flee,<br>
whilst the women of Israel divide the plunder.<br>
13<br>
Even those who lived amongst the sheepfolds found treasures --<br>
doves with wings of silver<br>
and feathers of gold.<br>
14<br>
The Almighty scattered the enemy kings<br>
like a blowing snowstorm on Mount Zalmon.<br>
15<br>
The mountains of Bashan are majestic,<br>
with many peaks stretching high into the sky.<br>
16<br>
Why do you look with envy, O rugged mountains,<br>
at Mount Zion, where God has chosen to live,<br>
where the Lord himself will live forever?<br>
17<br>
Surrounded by unnumbered thousands of chariots,<br>
the Lord came from Mount Sinai into his sanctuary.<br>
18<br>
When you ascended to the heights,<br>
you led a crowd of captives.<br>
You received gifts from the people,<br>
even from those who rebelled against you.<br>
Now the Lord God will live amongst us there.<br>
19<br>
Praise the Lord; praise God our saviour!<br>
For each day he carries us in his arms.<br>
<br>
Interlude<br>
<br>
20<br>
Our God is a God who saves!<br>
The Sovereign Lord rescues us from death.<br>
21<br>
But God will smash the heads of his enemies,<br>
crushing the skulls of those who love their guilty ways.<br>
22<br>
The Lord says, "I will bring my enemies down from Bashan;<br>
I will bring them up from the depths of the sea.<br>
<br>
(You, my people, will shatter your feet in their blood,)<br>
23<br>
You, my people, will wash your feet in their blood,<br>
and even your dogs will get their share!"<br>
24<br>
Your procession has come into view, O God --<br>
the procession of my God and King as he goes into the sanctuary.<br>
25<br>
Singers are in front, musicians behind;<br>
between them are young women playing tambourines.<br>
26<br>
Praise God, all you people of Israel;<br>
praise the Lord, the source of Israel's life.<br>
27<br>
Look, the little tribe of Benjamin leads the way.<br>
Then comes a great throng of rulers from Judah<br>
and all the rulers of Zebulun and Naphtali.<br>
<br>
(Your God has commanded your strength.)<br>
28<br>
Summon your might, O God.<br>
Display your power, O God, as you have in the past.<br>
29<br>
The kings of the earth are bringing tribute<br>
to your Temple in Jerusalem.<br>
30<br>
Rebuke these enemy nations --<br>
these wild animals lurking in the reeds,<br>
this herd of bulls amongst the weaker calves.<br>
Make them bring bars of silver in humble tribute.<br>
Scatter the nations that delight in war.<br>
31<br>
Let Egypt come with gifts of precious metals;<br>
(Let Egypt come with gifts of rich cloth;)<br>
(let Cush bring tribute to God.)<br>
let Ethiopia bring tribute to God.<br>

Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth.<br>
Sing praises to the Lord.<br>
<br>
Interlude<br>
<br>
33<br>
Sing to the one who rides across the ancient heavens,<br>
his mighty voice thundering from the sky.<br>
34<br>
Tell everyone about God's power.<br>
His majesty shines down on Israel;<br>
his strength is mighty in the heavens.<br>
35<br>
God is awesome in his sanctuary.<br>
The God of Israel gives power and strength to his people.<br>
Praise be to God!<br>

In Christian Essays 31, The Bible's greatest Hits, Chapter 31,<br>
We began that chapter by looking at the words to a new song by TobyMac.<br>
<br>
That was back at the end of August 2022.<br>
And now, over a year and a half later, in March of 2024,<br>
that same song, Faithfully, by TobyMac, eventually was released as a single in September of 2023<br>
and is now, in March of 2024, the number one most popular Christian music song<br>
on the Christian Music charts, being played the most on the Christian Music radio stations.<br>
The number two most popular song at this time was yet another song by Phil Wickham.<br>
This song by Phil Wickham, is titled, I Believe, and he makes it very clear who is God is.<br>
He clearly identifies the name of His God in this song. At least he does in English, using the English names.<br>
<br>
My family has been enjoying Phil Wickham's music for well over 24 years now,<br>
as we had collected many of his early releases for about three years<br>
since the year of 2000, before he eventually released his first official album in 2003.<br>
<br>
So, two artists that have continually blessed myself and my family for well over 24 years now,<br>
are the many albums and songs by TobyMac and Phil Wickham, and here they are in March of 2024,<br>
both of them still being the most popular Christian musicians, having the most popular Christian Hits, even after all of these years.<br>
<br>
So, if you want a good collection of Christian music, consider collecting the songs and albums of TobyMac and Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
In September of 2023, Phil Wickham's song, I Believe, was edited into a shorter radio version and released as a single.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, from Phil Wickham's tenth studio album, titled, I Believe, which came out on 4 August 2023,<br>
here are the words to the 2023 song, I Believe, by Phil Wickham.<br>
These are the words as they are found in the Album Version.<br>
A small amount of the words presented here have been edited out of the Radio Version, making the<br>
Radio Version 66 seconds shorter than the Album Version.<br>
<br>
<br>

Here is a verse that some people were thinking about when an eclipse happened a "cross" the Untied States on Monday 8th April 2024...<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 9:4 -- KJV<br>
9:4 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem,<br>
(and mark a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry)<br>
and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.<br>
<br>
<br>
Looking again at our usual reference books,<br>
mainly the Strong's Hebrew Lexicon and the<br>
Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions...<br>
<br>
<br>
use a cup, that is, an ink stand, inkhorn, inkwell, pot (for ink)<br>
<br>
and mark a mark<br>
and set a mark<br>
<br>
and set a tawv<br>
and taw-vaw a tawv<br>
<br>
a desire, mark<br>
by implication a signature<br>
and set a mark as a sign of exemption from judgement<br>
mark out, scratch or imprint a mark as a sign of exemption from judgement<br>
<br>
Here in Chapter 9, it talks about The Slaughter of Idolaters...<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 9 -- All of Ezekiel 9, All 11 verses -- NLT<br>
1 Then the Lord thundered, "Bring on the men appointed to punish the city! Tell them to bring their weapons with them!"<br>
2 Six men soon appeared from the upper gate that faces north, each carrying a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man dressed in linen, who carried a writer's case at his side. They all went into the Temple courtyard and stood beside the bronze altar.<br>
3 Then the glory of the God of Israel rose up from between the cherubim, where it had rested, and moved to the entrance of the Temple. And the Lord called to the man dressed in linen who was carrying the writer's case.<br>
4 He said to him, "Walk through the streets of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of all who weep and sigh because of the detestable sins being committed in their city."<br>
5 Then I heard the Lord say to the other men, "Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked. Show no mercy; have no pity!<br>
6 Kill them all -- old and young, girls and women and little children. But do not touch anyone with the mark. Begin right here at the Temple." So they began by killing the seventy leaders.<br>
7 "Defile the Temple!" the Lord commanded. "Fill its courtyards with corpses. Go!" So they went and began killing throughout the city.<br>
8 Whilst they were out killing, I was all alone. I fell face down on the ground and cried out, "O Sovereign Lord! Will your fury against Jerusalem wipe out everyone left in Israel?"<br>
9 Then he said to me, "The sins of the people of Israel and Judah are very, very great. The entire land is full of murder; the city is filled with injustice. They are saying, 'The Lord doesn't see it! The Lord has abandoned the land!'<br>
10 So I will not spare them or have any pity on them. I will fully repay them for all they have done."<br>
11 Then the man in linen clothing, who carried the writer's case, reported back and said, "I have done as you commanded."<br>
<br>
And that is all of Ezekiel that we will look at for now. In the next chapter, Chapter 10, The Lord's Glory Leaves the Temple.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's now look at some things in the book of Revelation.<br>
In Revelation 4, it talks about<br>
Worship in Heaven, then<br>
The Lamb Opens the Scroll<br>
and then, in Revelation 6,<br>
The Lamb Breaks the First Six Seals<br>
and we see here in Revelation 7,<br>
God's People Will Be Preserved.<br>
<br>
Revelation 7: 1-4 -- KJV<br>
7:1 And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.<br>
7:2 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,<br>
7:3 Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.<br>
7:4 And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 7: 1-4 -- NLT<br>
1 Then I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds so they did not blow on the earth or the sea, or even on any tree.<br>
2 And I saw another angel coming up from the east, carrying the seal of the living God. And he shouted to those four angels, who had been given power to harm land and sea,<br>
3 "Wait! Don't harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have placed the seal of God on the foreheads of his servants."<br>
4 And I heard how many were marked with the seal of God -- 144,000 were sealed from all the tribes of Israel:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 7: 1-4 -- TS2009<br>
1 And after this I saw four messengers standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.<br>
2 And I saw another messenger coming up from the rising of the sun, holding the seal of the living ELL-Low-Heem. And he cried with a loud voice to the four messengers to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,<br>
3 saying, "Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees until we have sealed the servants of our ELL-Low-Heem upon their foreheads."<br>
4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of all the tribes of the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL):<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After that, there is Praise from the Great Crowd,<br>
The Lamb Breaks the Seventh Seal,<br>
and then the angels get ready to sound The First Four Trumpets.<br>
<br>
Look at this right here. The Fifth Trumpet Brings the First Terror...<br>
Revelation 9: 1-11 --  KJV<br>
9:1 And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.<br>
9:2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.<br>
9:3 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.<br>
9:4 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.<br>
9:5 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.<br>
9:6 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.<br>
9:7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.<br>
9:8 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.<br>
9:9 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.<br>
9:10 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.<br>
9:11 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon (that is to say, A destroyer).<br>
<br>
Commentary: <br>
That makes me think about some kind of door, doorway, gateway or portal, some kind of portal being opened up to unleash evil.<br>
Evil comes out and is given some kind of freedom, for five months.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 9: 1-11 -- NLT<br>
1 Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky,<br>
and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.<br>
(and he was given the key to the shaft of the abyss, or, the underworld. )<br>
<br>
2 When he opened it, smoke poured out as though from a huge furnace, and the sunlight and air turned dark from the smoke.<br>
3 Then locusts came from the smoke and descended on the earth, and they were given power to sting like scorpions.<br>
4 They were told not to harm the grass or plants or trees, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.<br>
5 They were told not to kill them but to torture them for five months with pain like the pain of a scorpion sting.<br>
6 In those days people will seek death but will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them!<br>
7 The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. They had what looked like gold crowns on their heads, and their faces looked like human faces.<br>
8 They had hair like women's hair and teeth like the teeth of a lion.<br>
9 They wore armour made of iron, and their wings roared like an army of chariots rushing into battle.<br>
10 They had tails that stung like scorpions, and for five months they had the power to torment people.<br>
11 Their king is the angel from the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon -- the Destroyer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 9: 1-11 -- TS2009<br>
1 And the fifth messenger sounded, and I saw a star from the heaven which had fallen to the earth. And the key to the pit of the deep was given to him.<br>
2 And he opened the pit of the deep, and smoke went up out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun was darkened, also the air, because of the smoke of the pit.<br>
3 And out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth, and authority was given to them as the scorpions of the earth possess authority.<br>
4 And it was said to them that they shall not harm the grass of the earth, or any green matter, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of ELL-Low-Heem upon their foreheads.<br>
5 And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but to torture them for five months. And their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings a man.<br>
6 And in those days men shall seek death and shall not find it. And they shall long to die, but death shall flee from them.<br>
7 And the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle, and on their heads were crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.<br>
8 And they had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' teeth.<br>
9 And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle.<br>
10 And they have tails like scorpions, and stings. And in their tails is their authority to harm men five months.<br>
11 And they have over them a sovereign, the messenger of the pit of the deep, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apolluon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and then, The Sixth Trumpet Brings the Second Terror.<br>
<br>
<br>
If we now go to Chapter 12, we will read just a part of an interesting story about The Woman and the Dragon...<br>
<br>
Revelation 12: 1-9 --  KJV<br>
(And there appeared a great sign in heaven;)<br>
12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:<br>
12:2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.<br>
(And there appeared another sign in heaven;)<br>
12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.<br>
12:4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.<br>
12:5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.<br>
12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.<br>
12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,<br>
12:8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.<br>
12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 12: 1-9 -- NLT<br>
1 Then I witnessed in heaven an event of great significance. I saw a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon beneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head.<br>
2 She was pregnant, and she cried out because of her labour pains and the agony of giving birth.<br>
3 Then I witnessed in heaven another significant event. I saw a large red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, with seven crowns on his heads.<br>
4 His tail swept away one-third of the stars in the sky, and he threw them to the earth. He stood in front of the woman as she was about to give birth, ready to devour her baby as soon as it was born.<br>
5 She gave birth to a son who was to rule all nations with an iron rod. And her child was snatched away from the dragon and was caught up to God and to his throne.<br>
6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place to care for her for 1,260 days.<br>
<br>
Commentary: 1,260 days is about three and a half years.<br>
Using our current calendar system, 3 years, 5 months, 2 weeks, and 1 day equals 1,260 days.<br>
<br>
7 Then there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels.<br>
8 And the dragon lost the battle, and he and his angels were forced out of heaven.<br>
9 This great dragon -- the ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, the one deceiving the whole world -- was thrown down to the earth with all his angels.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 12: 1-9 -- TS2009<br>
1 And a great sign was seen in the heaven: a woman clad with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.<br>
2 And being pregnant, she cried out in labour and in pain to give birth.<br>
3 And another sign was seen in the heaven: and see, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.<br>
4 And his tail draws a third of the stars of the heaven and throws them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, to devour her child as soon as it was born.<br>
5 And she bore a male child who was to shepherd all nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught away to ELL-Low-Heem and to His throne.<br>
6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by ELL-Low-Heem, to be nourished there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.<br>
7 And there came to be fighting in the heaven: Michael and his messengers fought against the dragon. And the dragon and his messengers fought,<br>
8 but they were not strong enough, nor was a place found for them in the heaven any longer.<br>
9 And the great dragon was thrown out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who leads all the world astray. He was thrown to the earth, and his messengers were thrown out with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and then Revelation continues with,<br>
The Beast out of the Sea, followed by,<br>
The Beast out of the Earth.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Let's think about these two things that we have now just looked at.<br>
The Woman and the Dragon, a woman giving birth.<br>
The Fifth Trumpet that Brings the First Terror for five months.<br>
<br>
I witnessed in heaven an event of great significance, a great wonder in heaven, a great sign was seen in the heaven.<br>
Here are some thoughts to think about, and a possible perspective to consider.<br>
When looking up into the sky at night, and watching the stars and planets and other various luminaries up there in the heavens of outer space,<br>
maybe the way how they move around each other is a way how they communicate a story, and they are telling us about what is happening now, and what is about to happen next.<br>
<br>
The story about The Woman and the Dragon could be a story that is told by the way how those stars, planets and luminaries move around and interact with each other.<br>
A possible thought to consider is this. In September of 2017, there was a constellation that looks like a woman,<br>
and a star or planet, moved down, moving out from between her legs, like a baby being born.<br>
Could that event in September of 2017 be the telling of this story of the woman giving birth?<br>
There was an eclipse across the United States also in September of 2017, very close to that same time.<br>
Suppose that this could have been a sign that the seven year tribulation started in September of 2017.<br>
Seven years later would be September of 2024.<br>
<br>
The Fifth Trumpet that Brings the First Terror is a terror that lasts for five months.<br>
Another eclipse happened in the United States in April of 2024.<br>
This April 2024 eclipse, and the September 2017 eclipse, together they draw a tawv across the United States,<br>
This Hebrew letter, tawv, looks like the letter X, a mark, a cross, the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the end, the last.<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw, Jesus, is the first and the last.<br>
<br>
<br>
The tribulation events do not have to happen all over everywhere for them to become true.<br>
Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, told us that they only need to begin to happen, for it to be true.<br>
If it actually happened, even for just awhile, here in this country, or over there in some other country, then it did happen, and that prophecy became true.<br>
So when all these things begin to happen, don't sit down and look down at your phone, stand and look up, for your salvation is near!<br>
<br>
If the tribulation ends in September of 2024, this April 2024 eclipse is five months before September.<br>
The duration from this eclipse in April of 2024, to September of 2024, is five months.<br>
The Fifth Trumpet that Brings the First Terror is a terror that lasts for five months.<br>
Could this terror start right after this April 2024 eclipse and last for five months, until some time in September of 2024?<br>
We're not real sure about the amount of truth or accuracy of all of these thoughts presented here, but they sure seem to fit together.<br>
Maybe it is not a physical or visual terror, but more like a spiritual terror.<br>
Maybe it will all look exactly as described here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Haggai 2:6 -- NLT<br>
6 "For this is what (Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, The Lord of Hosts,) the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: In just a little while I will again shake the heavens and the earth, the oceans and the dry land.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.<br>
<br>
Luke 21: verse 20, and then verses 25 through 28 -- KJV<br>
21:20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.<br>
21:25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;<br>
21:26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.<br>
21:27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.<br>
21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 21: verse 20, and then verses 25 through 28 -- NLT<br>
20 "And when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then you will know that the time of its destruction has arrived.<br>
25 "And there will be strange signs in the sun, moon, and stars. And here on earth the nations will be in turmoil, perplexed by the roaring seas and strange tides.<br>
26 People will be terrified at what they see coming upon the earth, for the powers in the heavens will be shaken.<br>
27 Then everyone will see the Son of Man coming on a cloud with power and great glory.<br>
28 So when all these things begin to happen, stand and look up, for your salvation is near!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 21: verse 20, and then verses 25 through 28 -- TS2009<br>
20 "And when you see Yeh-Roo-Sha-Lye-Em surrounded by armies, then know that its laying waste is near.<br>
25 "And there shall be signs in the sun, and moon, and stars, and on the earth anxiety of nations, in bewilderment at the roaring of the sea, and agitation,<br>
26 men fainting from fear and the expectation of what is coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.<br>
27 "And then they shall see the Son of Ah-Dome coming in a cloud with power and much esteem.<br>
28 "And when these matters begin to take place, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After Daniel had his Vision of Four Beasts, he saw this...<br>
Daniel 7: 13 & 14 -- NLT<br>
13 As my vision continued that night, I saw someone like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient One and was led into his presence.<br>
14 He was given authority, honour, and sovereignty over all the nations of the world, so that people of every race and nation and language would obey him. His rule is eternal -- it will never end. His kingdom will never be destroyed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hallelu-Yaw-Who-Wah!<br>
The Elect One is coming back for His bride! Is He here yet? Check the door. Knock Knock!<br>
<br>
His arrival is my departure.<br>

Proverbs 12:26 -- TS2009<br>
The righteous is a guide to his neighbour, But the way of the wrong leads them astray.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Proverbs 12:26, the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.<br>
The KJV and the NLT teams both tried their best on trying to figure out what it could mean.<br>
Alternate possible meanings from the footnotes and margin notes are included here in round brackets.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 12:26 -- KJV<br>
(The righteous is more abundant than his neighbour:)<br>
The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.<br>

Proverbs 12:26 -- NLT<br>
The godly give good advice to their friends;<br>

This Bible study is special, because, if you make it all the way to the end of this Bible study, then you will have studied at least one verse from every single book in the entire Bible!<br>
That's a quick look at all 66 of the Bible books in the Bible.<br>
You can technically say that, when you're done here, you will have done a quick, brief study of the entire Bible!<br>
That's an accomplishment to be proud of!<br>
<br>
<br>
The total number of books in the King James Version (KJV) Bible today = 66 books.<br>
<br>
Total number of books in the KJV Bible when it was first released in 1611:<br>
It had 78 books, 12 more books than what it has today.<br>
12 books were removed from the KJV bible.<br>

<br>
The Revised Standard Version (RSV) with the Apocrypha has 4 more books than the KJV did when it was first released.<br>
<br>
<br>
One may argue which books should be in the Bible today.<br>
One could argue that, the number of books that should be in the Bible today<br>
should be a total of 85 books.<br>
<br>
<br>
The 85 books should be...<br>
<br>
Jubilees (1 book)<br>
Enoch (1 book)<br>
Jasher (1 book)<br>

KJV Apocrypha (12 books)<br>
Revised Standard Version (RSV) Apocrypha (4 more books, 16 Apocrypha books total)<br>

<br>
8 of 11. Additions to Daniel (3 chapters)<br>
Daniel and the Dragon, Susanna.<br>
<br>
<br>
The books of Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, and Additions to Daniel are part of the Apocrypha and are often included in various translations of the Bible.<br>
Here's a comparison and analysis of these three texts:<br>
<br>
Susanna:<br>
- Summary: Susanna tells the story of a virtuous Jewish woman falsely accused of adultery by two elders, Daniel intervenes and proves her innocence.<br>
- Key Points: Focuses on the theme of justice, innocence, and the wisdom of Daniel in delivering Susanna from false accusation.<br>
<br>
Bel and the Dragon:<br>
- Summary: Bel and the Dragon consists of two separate stories. In one, Daniel exposes the falsehood of idol worship by showing that the idol Bel cannot eat. In the other, Daniel kills a dragon worshipped as a god in Babylonia.<br>
- Key Points: Illustrates Daniel's wisdom and the superiority of the God of Israel over pagan idols.<br>
<br>
Additions to Daniel:<br>
- Summary: Additions to Daniel includes both Susanna and Bel and the Dragon, along with additional material such as the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Holy Children.<br>
- Difference: Whilst Susanna and Bel and the Dragon are included as separate stories in Additions to Daniel, they are not merged. Instead, they are presented alongside additional texts related to Daniel's experiences in Babylon.<br>
- Content: Additions to Daniel includes material not found in Susanna and Bel and the Dragon, such as the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Holy Children. These additional texts contribute to the overall theme of faithfulness in the face of adversity and divine deliverance.<br>
<br>
In summary, whilst Susanna and Bel and the Dragon are included in Additions to Daniel, they are not merged into a single narrative. Additions to Daniel contains additional content beyond these two stories, including the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Holy Children, which enrich the themes of faith, justice, and divine intervention found throughout the book of Daniel and its apocryphal additions.<br>

If you take a typical bank card, like a common debit card or credit card, and cut it in half,<br>
so that half of the long number is on the left, and the rest of the long number is on the right,<br>
imagine how small that half of a bank card would be -- imagine the size and shape of half of a bank card.<br>

It would obviously not contain the entire Bible, but there are books that small with selected Bible verses inside them.<br>

Here is something to think about in Acts 8.<br>
In the previous chapter, Acts Chapter 7,<br>
Stephen (a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit)<br>
was arrested and killed by the high council, known as the Sanhedrin.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 8: 1-25 -- KJV<br>
...at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.<br>
8:2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.<br>
8:3 As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.<br>
8:4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.<br>
8:5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.<br>
8:6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.<br>
8:7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.<br>
8:8 And there was great joy in that city.<br>
8:9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:<br>
8:10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.<br>
8:11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.<br>
8:12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.<br>
8:13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptised, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.<br>
8:14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:<br>
8:15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:<br>
8:16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.)<br>
8:17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.<br>
8:18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,<br>
8:19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.<br>
8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.<br>
8:21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.<br>
8:22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<br>
8:23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.<br>
8:24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.<br>
8:25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 8: 1-25 -- NLT<br>
...A great wave of persecution began that day, sweeping over the church in Jerusalem; and all the believers except the apostles were scattered through the regions of Judea and Samaria.<br>
2 (Some devout men came and buried Stephen with great mourning.)<br>
3 But Saul was going everywhere to destroy the church. He went from house to house, dragging out both men and women to throw them into prison.<br>
4 But the believers who were scattered preached the Good News about Jesus wherever they went.<br>
5 Philip, for example, went to the city of Samaria and told the people there about the Messiah.<br>
6 Crowds listened intently to Philip because they were eager to hear his message and see the miraculous signs he did.<br>
(Many unclean spirits were cast out,)<br>
7 Many evil spirits were cast out, screaming as they left their victims. And many who had been paralysed or lame were healed.<br>
8 So there was great joy in that city.<br>
9 A man named Simon had been a sorcerer there for many years, amazing the people of Samaria and claiming to be someone great.<br>
10 Everyone, from the least to the greatest, often spoke of him as "the Great One -- the Power of God."<br>
11 They listened closely to him because for a long time he had astounded them with his magic.<br>
12 But now the people believed Philip's message of Good News concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ. As a result, many men and women were baptised.<br>
13 Then Simon himself believed and was baptised. He began following Philip wherever he went, and he was amazed by the signs and great miracles Philip performed.<br>
14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had accepted God's message, they sent Peter and John there.<br>
15 As soon as they arrived, they prayed for these new believers to receive the Holy Spirit.<br>
16 The Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them, for they had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.<br>
17 Then Peter and John laid their hands upon these believers, and they received the Holy Spirit.<br>
18 When Simon saw that the Spirit was given when the apostles laid their hands on people, he offered them money to buy this power.<br>
19 "Let me have this power, too," he exclaimed, "so that when I lay my hands on people, they will receive the Holy Spirit!"<br>
20 But Peter replied, "May your money be destroyed with you for thinking God's gift can be bought!<br>
21 You can have no part in this, for your heart is not right with God.<br>
22 Repent of your wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive your evil thoughts,<br>
23 for I can see that you are full of bitter jealousy and are held captive by sin."<br>
24 "Pray to the Lord for me," Simon exclaimed, "that these terrible things you've said won't happen to me!"<br>
25 After testifying and preaching the word of the Lord in Samaria, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem. And they stopped in many Samaritan villages along the way to preach the Good News.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Matthew 10:2, Mark 3:16, and Luke 6:14 all record that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter.<br>
Peter, Petrus, a Greek name meaning "rock", a rock or a stone, one of the twelve disciples of Jesus, wrote the letters of 1 Peter and 2 Peter.<br>
In Matthew 16, we get the explanation of why Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter.<br>
Jesus asked His disciples (not just Peter) a question about who people think that Jesus is (Matthew 16:13).<br>
The disciples listed different opinions that have been circulating.<br>
Some think Jesus is a prophet. Some think Jesus is Elijah reincarnated.<br>
Jesus responds by saying, "But who do you say that I am?"<br>
Peter then says, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."<br>
Jesus responds, "I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church;<br>
and the gates of Hades will not overpower it."<br>
Careful analysis of the context demonstrates what Jesus is really teaching.<br>
Whilst Peter's name means rock, it is actually Peter's confession about who Jesus is<br>
(Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God) that Jesus will build His church upon.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Maybe Simon's name was changed to Peter because Jesus knew about this other Simon before they encountered him later on.<br>
<br>
In Verse 9, NLT and KJV say, a certain man, called Simon, had been a sorcerer there, and used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria,<br>
claiming to be someone great, acting like he was some great one.<br>
<br>
In Verse 20, Peter told Simon, "May your money be destroyed with you for thinking God's gift can be bought!<br>
Simon asks for prayer, but they knew his secret motives, Simon did not really want to Repent, and the story just suddenly ends, and they walk away, and they move on.<br>
It said in verse 13 that this fake and evil Simon himself believed and was baptised. Did he do it just for show? What was really going on in his heart?<br>
Did he only do it so that he would get more customers, and make more money?<br>
<br>
Peter was one of the apostles, and Simon Magus, is this Samaritan wizard, who wanted to do these miracle powers for his own selfish glory, and to make money from doing these powers and miracles.<br>
Peter and Simon are two totally different names, and two totally different men. Be careful not to carelessly mix them up, or merge them together.<br>
Calling someone Simon-Peter would be a mistake.<br>
<br>
Here is an idea. If this evil Simon also changed his name to Peter later on, he could then open up counterfeit churches in his name, and churches named after Peter might really be named after Simon Magus, this Samaritan wizard.<br>
<br>
Some examples of churches that have Peter in their name include St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, St. Peter's Church in Cologne, Germany, and St. Peter's Church in New York City, USA.<br>
<br>
Who are these churches really named after?<br>
<br>

<br>
There are two very interesting bits of Scripture at the end of the book of Joel.<br>
If you should ever do a deeper Bible study on the book of Joel,<br>
and should look at the ancient Hebrew text,<br>
Joel 2:28-32 are numbered as Joel 3:1-5 in the ancient Hebrew text,<br>
and that difference will result in Joel 3:1-21 being numbered as Joel 4:1-21 in the ancient Hebrew text.<br>
We will start by reading Joel 2, verses 20-32, which is going to the end of Joel 2.<br>
And then, we will read an area that takes us to the end of Joel, chapter 3, which will take us to the end of the book of Joel.<br>
When we get to the famous and popular verse 25, the verse that talks about four kinds of locusts,<br>
the precise identification of the four kinds of locusts mentioned there is uncertain.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In Joel Chapter 1, the locusts are talked about as a nation with an army that invades the land.<br>
Maybe it is a picture of an invading nation with four kinds of armies, entering, attacking and devouring in four kinds of ways?<br>
For example, by foot, with tanks, with missiles, with drones, with hang gliders and paragliders, from the air, dropping bombs or by troops dropping in by parachute.<br>
Like, in the United States military, there can be multiple ways to attack and invade, by land, by sea, by air, with foot soldiers, missiles and drones.<br>
The United States military has four kinds of armies, for example, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, and the Air Force.<br>
Maybe the four kinds of locusts might also be, one kind from the north, another kind from the south, another kind from the east, and a fourth kind from the west?<br>
Joel Chapter 1 indicates that they do not all come at one time.<br>
<br>
Joel 1:4 -- NLT<br>
After the cutting locusts finished eating the crops,<br>
the swarming locusts took what was left!<br>
After them came the hopping locusts,<br>
and then the stripping locusts, too!<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah promises to restore what the locust hath eaten.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah promises to restore what you have lost.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joel 2: 20-32 -- KJV<br>
<br>
2:20 But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up,<br>
(because he hath magnified to do.)<br>
(because he hath magnified to do great things.)<br>
because he hath done great things.<br>
<br>
2:21 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.<br>
2:22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.<br>
<br>
(Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you a teacher of righteousness, according to righteousness, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.)<br>
2:23 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.<br>
<br>
2:24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil.<br>
2:25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent amongst you.<br>
2:26 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.<br>
2:27 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.<br>
2:28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:<br>
2:29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.<br>
2:30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.<br>
2:31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.<br>
2:32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joel 2: 20-32 -- NLT<br>
20<br>
I will drive away these armies from the north.<br>
I will send them into the parched wastelands.<br>
<br>
(Those in the front will be driven into the eastern sea,<br>
and those at the rear into the western sea.)<br>
<br>
Those in the front will be driven into the Dead Sea,<br>
and those at the rear into the Mediterranean.<br>
The stench of their rotting bodies will rise over the land."<br>
Surely the Lord has done great things!<br>
21<br>
Don't be afraid, O land.<br>
Be glad now and rejoice,<br>
for the Lord has done great things.<br>
22<br>
Don't be afraid, you animals of the field,<br>
for the wilderness pastures will soon be green.<br>
The trees will again be filled with fruit;<br>
fig trees and grapevines will be loaded down once more.<br>
23<br>
Rejoice, you people of Jerusalem!<br>
Rejoice in the Lord your God!<br>
For the rain he sends demonstrates his faithfulness.<br>
Once more the autumn rains will come,<br>
as well as the rains of spring.<br>
24<br>
The threshing floors will again be piled high with grain,<br>
and the presses will overflow with new wine and olive oil.<br>
25<br>
The Lord says, "I will give you back what you lost<br>
to the swarming locusts, the hopping locusts,<br>
the stripping locusts, and the cutting locusts.<br>
It was I who sent this great destroying army against you.<br>
26<br>
Once again you will have all the food you want,<br>
and you will praise the Lord your God,<br>
who does these miracles for you.<br>
Never again will my people be disgraced.<br>
27<br>
Then you will know that I am amongst my people Israel,<br>
that I am the Lord your God, and there is no other.<br>
Never again will my people be disgraced.<br>
28<br>
"Then, after doing all those things,<br>
I will pour out my Spirit upon all people.<br>
Your sons and daughters will prophesy.<br>
Your old men will dream dreams,<br>
and your young men will see visions.<br>
29<br>
In those days I will pour out my Spirit<br>
even on servants -- men and women alike.<br>
30<br>
And I will cause wonders in the heavens and on the earth --<br>
blood and fire and columns of smoke.<br>
31<br>
The sun will become dark,<br>
and the moon will turn blood red<br>
before<br>
(that great and glorious day of the Lord arrives.)<br>
that great and terrible day of the Lord arrives.<br>
32<br>
But everyone who calls on the name of the Lord<br>
will be saved,<br>
for some on Mount Zion in Jerusalem will escape,<br>
just as the Lord has said.<br>
These will be amongst the survivors<br>
whom the Lord has called.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joel 2: 20-32 -- TS2009<br>
20 "And the Northerner I shall remove far from you, and drive him away into a dry and deserted land, with his face toward the eastern sea and his rear toward the western sea. And his stench shall come up and his smell rise, for he has done greatly."<br>
21 Do not fear, O soil, be glad and rejoice, for Yaw-Who-Wah has done greatly!<br>
22 Do not fear, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness shall spring forth, and the tree shall bear its fruit, the fig tree and the vine shall yield their strength.<br>
23 And you children of Tsiyon, be glad and rejoice in Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem, for He shall give you the Teacher of Righteousness, and cause the rain to come down for you, the former rain and the latter rain, as before.<br>
24 And the threshing-floors shall be filled with grain, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.<br>
25 "Then I shall repay you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the crawling locust, and the consuming locust, and the gnawing locust, My great army which I sent amongst you.<br>
26 "Then you shall eat -- eat and be satisfied -- and shall praise the Name of Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem, who has done with you so wondrously. And My people shall never be put to shame.<br>
27 "And you shall know that I am in the midst of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), and that I am Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem and there is no one else. And My people shall never be put to shame.<br>
28 "And after this it shall be that I pour out My Spirit on all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men dream dreams, your young men see visions.<br>
29 "And also on the male servants and on the female servants I shall pour out My Spirit in those days.<br>
30 "And I shall give signs in the heavens and upon the earth: blood and fire and columns of smoke,<br>
31 the sun is turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and awesome day of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
32 "And it shall be that everyone who calls on the Name of Yaw-Who-Wah shall be delivered. For on Mount Tsiyon and in Yeh-Roo-Shuh-Lie-Em (Jerusalem) there shall be an escape as Yaw-Who-Wah has said, and amongst the survivors whom Yaw-Who-Wah calls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Threshing is to separate the grain or seeds from the stalks of cereal plants by beating, to beat or strike.<br>
Threshing is to remove the seeds of crop plants by hitting them, using either a machine or a hand tool.<br>
It is the act of separating grains of rice, wheat, etc. from the rest of the plant using a machine or, especially in the past, by hitting it with a special tool.<br>
The word, concise, comes from the 16th Century, from the Latin word, concisus, which means, to cut short.<br>
Concision is the quality of giving only the information that is necessary and important, using few words.<br>
Concision is expressing what needs to be said without using unnecessary words.<br>
To be concise is to be brief but comprehensive.<br>
The valley described here, next, in Joel 3:14, sounds like it is a place where a decision is made, to trim and separate what is necessary and important to keep, from what is to be thrown away and discarded.<br>
Do you get get saved and kept, or do you get thrown into the fire? Keep what is of value, and bin, throw away, what is not.<br>
Keep the ones who are of value, and bin, throw away, the ones who are not. It takes a beating to sort the one from the other.<br>
Going through a hard and difficult life will make you better, or bitter; it will strengthen you and your faith and belief unto salvation, or not.<br>
Are you going to let this life make you better, or bitter? Are you going to heaven or hell? You make the decision.<br>
<br>
<br>
Joel 3: 14-21 -- KJV<br>
(Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of concision:)<br>
(Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of threshing:)<br>
3:14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.<br>
<br>
3:15 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.<br>
<br>
3:16 The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake:<br>
(but the LORD will be the place of repair of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.)<br>
(but the LORD will be the place of harbour of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.)<br>
(but the LORD will be the harbour of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.)<br>
but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.<br>

3:17 So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain:<br>
(then shall Jerusalem be holiness,)<br>
then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.<br>
<br>
3:18 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine,<br>
(and the hills shall go with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall go with waters,)<br>
and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.<br>
<br>
3:19 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.<br>
(But Judah shall abide for ever,)<br>
3:20 But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.<br>

Joel 3: 14-21 -- NLT<br>
14<br>
Thousands upon thousands are waiting in the valley of decision.<br>
There the day of the Lord will soon arrive.<br>
15<br>
The sun and moon will grow dark,<br>
and the stars will no longer shine.<br>
16<br>
The Lord's voice will roar from Zion<br>
and thunder from Jerusalem,<br>
and the heavens and the earth will shake.<br>
But the Lord will be a refuge for his people,<br>
a strong fortress for the people of Israel.<br>
17<br>
"Then you will know that I, the Lord your God,<br>
live in Zion, my holy mountain.<br>
Jerusalem will be holy forever,<br>
and foreign armies will never conquer her again.<br>
18<br>
In that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine,<br>
and the hills will flow with milk.<br>
Water will fill the streambeds of Judah,<br>
and a fountain will burst forth from the Lord's Temple,<br>
(watering the arid valley of Shittim.)<br>
watering the arid valley of acacias.<br>
19<br>
But Egypt will become a wasteland<br>
and Edom will become a wilderness,<br>
because they attacked the people of Judah<br>
and killed innocent people in their land.<br>
20<br>
"But Judah will be filled with people forever,<br>
and Jerusalem will endure through all generations.<br>
21<br>
I will pardon my people's crimes,<br>
which I have not yet pardoned;<br>
<br>
(and I, the Lord, will make my home<br>
in Zion with my people.")<br>
and I, the Lord, will make my home<br>
in Jerusalem with my people."<br>

Joel 3: 14-21 -- TS2009<br>
14 Crowds, crowds in the valley of decision! For the day of Yaw-Who-Wah is near in the valley of decision.<br>
15 Sun and moon shall become dark, and stars shall withdraw their brightness.<br>
16 And Yaw-Who-Wah shall roar from Tsiyon, and give forth His voice from Yeh-Roo-Shuh-Lie-Em (Jerusalem). And the heavens and earth shall shake, but Yaw-Who-Wah shall be a refuge for His people, and a stronghold for the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL).<br>
17 "Then you shall know that I am Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem, dwelling in Tsiyon, My set-apart mountain. And Yeh-Roo-Shuh-Lie-Em (Jerusalem) shall be set-apart, and foreigners shall not pass through her again.<br>
18 "And it shall be in that day that the mountains drip with new wine, and the hills flow with milk. And all the streams of Yeh-Who-Duh (Judah) shall be flooded with water, and a fountain flow from the House of Yaw-Who-Wah and water the wadi (the valley of) Shittim.<br>
19 "Meets-Rye-EEm (Egypt) shall become a ruin, and Eddom a ruin, a wilderness, because of violence done to the people of Yeh-Who-Duh (Judah), whose innocent blood they shed in their land.<br>
20 "But Yeh-Who-Duh (Judah) shall dwell forever, and Yeh-Roo-Shuh-Lie-Em (Jerusalem) to all generations.<br>
21 "And I shall cleanse their blood, which I have not cleansed. And Yaw-Who-Wah shall be dwelling in Tsiyon!"<br>
<br>

In Joel 3:21, the TS2009 contained a translation error, and it was corrected with words from the KJV.<br>

My daughter's favourite Bible verse, in May of 2024, was Exodus 14:14...<br>
<br>
Exodus 14:14 -- Eth Cepher, 3rd Edition, Revision 2.1 (2020)<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 14:14 -- KJV<br>
The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 14: 13 & 14 -- KJV<br>
14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD,<br>
which he will shew to you to day:<br>
(For whereas you have seen the Egyptians today)<br>
for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.<br>
14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 14:14 -- TS2009<br>
14 Yaw-Who-Wah does fight for you, and you keep silent.<br>
<br>
Exodus 14: 13 & 14 -- TS2009<br>
13 And Moe-Shay said to the people, "Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the deliverance of Yaw-Who-Wah, which He does for you today. For the Mitsrites (the Meets-Rights, the Egyptians) whom you see today, you are never, never to see again.<br>
14 Yaw-Who-Wah does fight for you, and you keep silent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 14:14 -- NLT<br>
The Lord himself will fight for you. Just stay calm."<br>
<br>
Exodus 14: 13 & 14 -- NLT<br>
13 But Moses told the people, "Don't be afraid. Just stand still and watch the Lord rescue you today. The Egyptians you see today will never be seen again.<br>
14 The Lord himself will fight for you. Just stay calm."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, we pray to you now. May we stand still, and watch and see you, Yaw-Who-Wah, rescue us today. The world that we see today will never be seen again, forever.  Let us receive and believe your promise, as you, Yaw-Who-Wah, shall fight for us, and help us hold your peace. Ah-Main.<br>
