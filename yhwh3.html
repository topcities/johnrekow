The Christian Essays are attempts to provide insight, meaning, understanding, interpretation and encouragement from various verses, paragraphs, stories and chapters of the Bible.<br>
<br>
The opinions, views and comments on the Christian Essay Pages are from the website author only. <br>
The opinions, views and comments are completely separate from, and in no way reflect, the views and opinions of the web host or its sponsors, employees, affiliates or advertisers.<br>
Bible scriptures are quoted from one of these five English translations:<br>
King James Version (KJV) (1611)<br>
New King James Version (NKJV) (1982)<br>
New International Version (NIV) (1978, with revisions published in 1984 and 2011.)<br>
New Living Translation (NLT) (1996, with revisions published in 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2015.)<br>
New American Standard Bible (NASB) (1995)<br>
<br>
Different people all reading from the NLT may not each see the exact same wording in the NLT, due to the multiple revisions published.<br>
<br>
<br>
The NIV was updated in 1984 and 2011.<br>
Some have rejected the NIV 2011 update because of gender-neutral language.<br>
If different people are studying together in the NIV version, they may encounter differences in the wording due to the different NIV editions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even though there is now a 2020 edition of the New American Standard Bible (NASB), when we choose to occasionally quote the NASB, we will be quoting from the previous, 1995 edition, unless we specifically say otherwise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commandments<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Warning!<br>
Some parts of the Bible contain strong adult content that may not be suitable for young children.<br>
Some of the content in a Bible study may contain Bible verse readings, quotations, commentaries, details and descriptions that may be considered graphic, sexually-explicit, disturbing or upsetting.<br>
<br>
The New Living Translation (1996) has been revised throughout the years after its release, to help improve its accuracy and precision.<br>
The Second Edition of the NLT (also called the NLTse) was released in 2004. A revision in 2007 was comprised of mostly minor textual or footnote changes. Other revisions were released in 2013 and 2015 with minor changes throughout.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:7<br>
7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
7 Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground. He breathed the breath of life into the man's nostrils, and the man became a living person.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sin<br>
A real quick look in Genesis, chapters 2 and 3<br>
<br>
Genesis 2 (KJV) verse 17<br>
17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.<br>
(for in the day that thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die.)<br>
<br>
A quick look at a conversation in<br>
Genesis 3: parts of verses 11 through 13, NLT:<br>
The Lord: Have you eaten from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat?<br>
Adam: It was the woman you gave me who gave me the fruit, and I ate it.<br>
Eve: "The serpent deceived me," she replied. "That's why I ate it."<br>
NLT, Genesis 3, Verse 22, The Lord, talking to the Son and the Holy Spirit (The Trinity): Then the Lord God said, "Look, the human beings have become like us, knowing both good and evil. <br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  This entire story is an entire Bible Study all of its own, but, to keep it short and simple for now, because of them letting that good and evil knowledge enter into them, there was a curse and a punishment that came into being, and it entered into all future human beings and into all of the world.<br>
Basically, the title deed of planet earth, which was in the hands of Adam and Eve, was transferred over to Satan, making him the prince of this world, and the god of this world, which is why we have disease, decay, a gradual movement from order to disorder, cancer, disaster, crimes, greed, bullying, foolishness, stupidity, selfishness, and sin, in all of the world, and in all human beings.<br>
Don't worry.  Spoiler alert! There is a happy ending.  The title deed will get transferred to Jesus Christ in the end times, which is talked about in the book of Revelation.<br>
<br>
Here is a short sample of some of the curse and punishment described in Genesis 3.<br>
<br>
Genesis 3:19 (KJV) The Lord is talking to Adam...<br>
19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.<br>
<br>
Genesis 3:19  (NLT)<br>
19 By the sweat of your brow<br>
will you have food to eat<br>
until you return to the ground<br>
from which you were made.<br>
For you were made from dust,<br>
and to dust you will return."<br>

<a name="YAH3WHATISINIQ"></a><h2>What is Sin?</h2>
<p>
<br>
What is Sin?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59 (KJV)<br>
1 Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:<br>
2 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, (your sins have made him hide his face from you) that he will not hear.<br>
3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.<br>
4 None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59<br>
NLT verses 1 through 8<br>
1<br>
Listen! The Lord's arm is not too weak to save you,<br>
nor is his ear too deaf to hear you call.<br>
2<br>
It's your sins that have cut you off from God.<br>
Because of your sins, he has turned away<br>
and will not listen anymore.<br>
3<br>
Your hands are the hands of murderers,<br>
and your fingers are filthy with sin.<br>
Your lips are full of lies,<br>
and your mouth spews corruption.<br>
4<br>
No one cares about being fair and honest.<br>
The people's lawsuits are based on lies.<br>
They conceive evil deeds<br>
and then give birth to sin.<br>
5<br>
They hatch deadly snakes<br>
and weave spiders' webs.<br>
Whoever eats their eggs will die;<br>
whoever cracks them will hatch a viper.<br>
6<br>
Their webs can't be made into clothing,<br>
and nothing they do is productive.<br>
All their activity is filled with sin,<br>
and violence is their trademark.<br>
7<br>
Their feet run to do evil,<br>
and they rush to commit murder.<br>
They think only about sinning.<br>
Misery and destruction always follow them.<br>
8<br>
They don't know where to find peace<br>
or what it means to be just and good.<br>
They have mapped out crooked roads,<br>
and no one who follows them knows a moment's peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, what is Sin? What are iniquities?<br>
<br>
We will once again turn to the Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Strong's Concordance, which is a Bible concordance, an index of every word in the King James Version (KJV), constructed under the direction of James Strong, first published in 1890.<br>

From the Strong's Concordance:<br>
In verse 2, the original Hebrew word in that spot there, for, iniquities, is pronounced, "I've-Owned."<br>
It means, perversity, evil, fault, iniquity, mischief, depravity, guilt, sin.<br>

And then, also in verse 2, where we see the English word, Sin,<br>
the original Hebrew word can be pronounced in two possible ways.<br>
One way would be, "Heh-Tuh-Ah"<br>
and another way would be, "Heh-Tahth."<br>

It has these possible meanings:<br>
offence (sometimes habitual sinfulness)<br>
of course, it means, Sin.<br>
and it is based on another Hebrew word, pronounced, "Hah-Tah."<br>
which means,<br>
to sin, miss, miss the way, go wrong, incur guilt, forfeit, purify from uncleanness<br>
to sin, miss the goal or path of right and duty<br>
to bear loss, to miss the mark, to miss oneself, lose oneself, wander from the way<br>
to forfeit, lack, lead astray, condemn, bear the blame, loss, miss.<br>
<br>
And so, we can say that, Sin means, to fall short and miss the mark.<br>
A good example would be, shooting an arrow at a target, and instead of perfectly hitting the centre of the target (the bull's eye), instead, it lands somewhere on the grass nearby, totally missing the target you were aiming at.<br>
I would end up doing that, because I don't know what I am doing when it comes to doing something like that.<br>
<br>
Romans 3:10 (KJV)<br>
...There is none righteous, no, not one:<br>
<br>
Romans 3:23 (KJV)<br>
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br>
<br>
Commentary: Jesus knows how good I am at trying to shoot an arrow at a target.  That's why...<br>
<br>
Luke 23:34<br>
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing."<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 103:14 (KJV)<br>
For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.<br>
<br>
Psalms 103:14 -- New American Standard Bible (NASB) (1995)<br>
14<br>
(For He Himself knows what we are made of;)<br>
For He Himself knows our frame;<br>
He is mindful that we are but dust.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  He remembers what we are made of.  That is why he has compassion on us.<br>
If I am like dust, and a breeze of wind comes along, do I have any say or control about the speed and direction I travel, or when I choose to land and settle down again?<br>
God is like the wind.  You cannot see Him, but you can see the results of what He can do.<br>
<br>
John 3:8 (KJV)<br>
8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.<br>
NLT:<br>
8 The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can't tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can't explain how people are born of the Spirit."<br>

<br>
Old Testament Commandments<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Ten Commandments<br>
Exodus chapter 19, last verse at the end of chapter 19<br>
verse 25<br>
 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.<br>
continuing into Exodus chapter 20, verse 1...<br>
1 And God spake all these words, saying,<br>
2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage (out of the house of servants).<br>
3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<br>
4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:<br>
5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;<br>
6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.<br>
7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.<br>
8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:<br>
11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.<br>
12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.<br>
13 Thou shalt not kill.<br>
14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br>
15 Thou shalt not steal.<br>
16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.<br>
17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.<br>
18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.<br>
19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.<br>
20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Exodus 19, verse 25<br>
25 So Moses went down to the people and told them what the Lord had said.<br>
Exodus 20<br>
1 Then God gave the people all these instructions (all these words):<br>
2 "I am the Lord your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place of your slavery.<br>
3 "You must not have any other god but me.<br>
4 "You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea. <br>
5 You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected—even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me. <br>
6 But I lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those (for thousands of those) who love me and obey my commands.<br>
7 "You must not misuse the name of the Lord your God. The Lord will not let you go unpunished if you misuse his name.<br>
8 "Remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. <br>
9 You have six days each week for your ordinary work, <br>
10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the Lord your God. On that day no one in your household may do any work. This includes you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, your livestock, and any foreigners living among you. <br>
11 For in six days the Lord made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything in them; but on the seventh day he rested. That is why the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart as holy.<br>
12 "Honour your father and mother. Then you will live a long, full life in the land the Lord your God is giving you.<br>
13 "You must not murder.<br>
14 "You must not commit adultery.<br>
15 "You must not steal.<br>
16 "You must not testify falsely against your neighbour.<br>
17 "You must not covet your neighbour's house. You must not covet your neighbour's wife, male or female servant, ox or donkey, or anything else that belongs to your neighbour."<br>
18 When the people heard the thunder and the loud blast of the ram's horn, and when they saw the flashes of lightning and the smoke billowing from the mountain, they stood at a distance, trembling with fear.<br>
19 And they said to Moses, "You speak to us, and we will listen. But don't let God speak directly to us, or we will die!"<br>
20 "Don't be afraid," Moses answered them, "for God has come in this way to test you, and so that your fear of him will keep you from sinning!"<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  The Ten Commandments did not stop at ten.  It kept going!  Have you memorised the Ten Commandments?  <br>
There are a total of 613 commandments in the Old Testament. Did you memorise all 613 of them? <br>
<br>
Here are a few other, lesser-known examples:<br>
<br>
Micah 6:8<br>
He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? <br>
NLT:<br>
8<br>
No, O people, the Lord has told you what is good,<br>
and this is what he requires of you:<br>
to do what is right, to love mercy,<br>
and to walk humbly with your God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 18:17 & 18 (KJV)<br>
17 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.<br>
18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister (to take one wife to another sister), to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 18:17 & 18 (NLT, first edition)<br>
"Do not have sexual intercourse with both a woman and her daughter or marry both a woman and her granddaughter, whether her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter. They are close relatives, and to do this would be a horrible wickedness.<br>
Do not marry a woman and her sister because they will be rivals.<br>
But if your wife dies, then it is all right to marry her sister.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 18:17 & 18 (NLT, second edition)<br>
"Do not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. And do not take (do not marry) her granddaughter, whether her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter, and have sexual relations with her. They are close relatives, and this would be a wicked act.<br>
Whilst your wife is living, do not marry her sister and have sexual relations with her, for they would be rivals.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22:5 (KJV)<br>
5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22:5 (NLT, first edition)<br>
A woman must not wear men's clothing, and a man must not wear women's clothing. The LORD your God detests people who do this.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22:5 (NLT, second edition)<br>
5 "A woman must not put on men's clothing, and a man must not wear women's clothing. Anyone who does this is detestable in the sight of the Lord your God.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22:11 (KJV)<br>
11 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22:11 (NLT, first edition)<br>
Do not wear clothing made of wool and linen woven together.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22:11 (NLT, second edition)<br>
11 "You must not wear clothing made of wool and linen woven together.<br>
<br>
Commentary: I remember hearing a news report many years ago about how scientists observed that, wearing linen and wool at the same time caused significant interference with a person's electromagnetic field.<br>
This could put an extra strain on a person's body and make them unusually weak and fatigued over a long period of time.<br>
Once again, science discovers that, what the Bible was saying all along was actually true. <br>
The Bible is true, even if you do not yet have an explanation why. My advice to you is to trust and obey the Bible, read your Bible and pray, every single day, and then, you can ask God why after you safely arrive in Heaven.<br>
<br>
No one knew about electromagnetic fields when this was written 3600 years ago.  All they could do was trust and obey God, and that they need to obey God's commandments even if they did not understand why those commandments existed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Since we were just talking about linen, some may not know that cotton and linen are two entirely different fabrics.<br>
<br>
Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fibre that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants.<br>
The Boll, spelled, B O L L, is the rounded capsule part of a cotton plant that contains the seeds.<br>
The Cotton plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world.<br>
The Cotton fibre is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile.<br>
<br>
Linen is a textile made from the fibres of the flax plant.<br>
Flax is a food and fibre crop cultivated in cooler regions of the world.<br>
Textiles made from flax are known in Western countries as linen, and are traditionally used for bed sheets, underclothes, and table linen. Its oil is known as linseed oil.<br>
Linen is very strong and absorbent, and dries faster than cotton.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 30:20 (NLT, second edition)<br>
An adulterous woman consumes a man, then wipes her mouth and says, "What's wrong with that?"<br>
<br>
Proverbs 30:20 (NLT, first edition)<br>
Equally amazing is how an adulterous woman can satisfy her sexual appetite, shrug her shoulders, and then say, "What's wrong with that?"<br>
<br>
Proverbs 30:20 (KJV)<br>
20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.<br>
<br>
Here are a few more examples of some additional Commandments...<br>
<br>
By the way, the first five books of the Bible are known as the Pentateuch.<br>
All five of those books, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, were all written by Moses when he was in the wilderness (more like a desert, actually)<br>
sometime around the 15th Century BC, which is about three thousand, six hundred years ago (3600 years ago).<br>
<br>
So, remember, what you are about to read, from Leviticus 11, was written about 3600 years ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 11, verse 29 through 35 (KJV)<br>
29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,<br>
30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.<br>
31 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.<br>
32 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.<br>
33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.<br>
34 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.<br>
35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.<br>
<br>
Leviticus 11:29 & 30 (NLT, first edition)<br>
"Of the small animals that scurry or creep on the ground, these are unclean for you:<br>
the mole, the mouse, the great lizard of all varieties, the gecko, the monitor lizard, the common lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon<br>
<br>
NLT Verses 31 through 35 are very similar to the NLT second edition, so we will just continue in the NLT second edition....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 11, verse 29 through 35 (NLT, second edition)<br>
29 "Of the small animals that scurry along the ground, these are unclean for you: the mole rat, the rat, large lizards of all kinds, <br>
30 the gecko, the monitor lizard, the common lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon. <br>
31 All these small animals are unclean for you. If any of you touch the dead body of such an animal, you will be defiled until evening. <br>
32 If such an animal dies and falls on something, that object will be unclean. This is true whether the object is made of wood, cloth, leather, or burlap. Whatever its use, you must dip it in water, and it will remain defiled until evening. After that, it will be ceremonially clean and may be used again.<br>
33 "If such an animal falls into a clay pot, everything in the pot will be defiled, and the pot must be smashed. <br>
34 If the water from such a container spills on any food, the food will be defiled. And any beverage in such a container will be defiled. <br>
35 Any object on which the carcass of such an animal falls will be defiled. If it is an oven or hearth, it must be destroyed, for it is defiled, and you must treat it accordingly.<br>
<br>
end of Verse 35, NLT first edition:<br>
...It has become defiled and it will remain that way.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  All they could do is trust and obey God.  Why should we do this?  Because, Father knows best. If he knows how to make an entire universe in only 6 days, he must know some things that we do not know or understand.<br>
No one asked why do we need to do these things. They did not understand.  All they could do was trust and obey.<br>
<br>
Today, we have libraries, universities, accumulated knowledge and scientific explanations to support why these rules and regulations would be good to follow.<br>
Today, we have microscopes that allow us to see germs and bacteria, and we can offer good, scientific explanations.<br>
When Leviticus was written, nobody knew about any of these things involving germs and bacteria, except God.  They just had to trust that Father knows best.<br>
<br>
<br>
One last sample to look at.  Whilst reading this, think about what kind of food these animals eat. That might give you a clue as to why some should not be eaten.<br>
<br>
Leviticus 11: verse 9 through 19<br>
9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.<br>
10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:<br>
11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.<br>
12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.<br>
13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,<br>
14 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;<br>
15 Every raven after his kind;<br>
16 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,<br>
17 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,<br>
18 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,<br>
19 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.<br>
<br>
NLT<br>
9 "Of all the marine animals, these are ones you may use for food. You may eat anything from the water if it has both fins and scales, whether taken from salt water or from streams. <br>
10 But you must never eat animals from the sea or from rivers that do not have both fins and scales. They are detestable to you. This applies both to little creatures that live in shallow water and to all creatures that live in deep water. <br>
11 They will always be detestable to you. You must never eat their meat or even touch their dead bodies. <br>
12 Any marine animal that does not have both fins and scales is detestable to you.<br>
13 "These are the birds that are detestable to you. You must never eat them: the griffon vulture, the bearded vulture, the black vulture, <br>
14 the kite, falcons of all kinds, <br>
15 ravens of all kinds, <br>
16 the eagle owl, the short-eared owl, the seagull, hawks of all kinds, <br>
17 the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, <br>
18 the barn owl, the desert owl, the Egyptian vulture, <br>
19 the stork, herons of all kinds, the hoopoe, and the bat.<br>

<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 14: verses 9 through 18<br>
KJV<br>
9 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:<br>
10 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.<br>
11 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.<br>
12 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,<br>
13 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,<br>

<br>
Deuteronomy 14: verses 9 through 18, NLT<br>
9 "Of all the marine animals, you may eat whatever has both fins and scales. <br>
10 You may not, however, eat marine animals that do not have both fins and scales. They are ceremonially unclean for you.<br>
11 "You may eat any bird that is ceremonially clean. <br>
12 These are the birds you may not eat: the griffon vulture, the bearded vulture, the black vulture, <br>
13 the kite, the falcon, buzzards of all kinds, <br>

17 the desert owl, the Egyptian vulture, the cormorant, <br>
18 the stork, herons of all kinds, the hoopoe, and the bat.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: I like the parts here that basically say, do not eat bats. I've have that one down! I totally have that one faithfully obeyed. I am very good at obeying that commandment!<br>
Sea creatures that have no scales or fins are typically bottom-feeders, as modern-day scientists and marine biologists have observed in recent centuries.<br>
They usually feed on the ocean floor, eating the waste products, the fish poop, and the dead carcasses that rest in peace on the ocean floor.<br>
When we see how these animals get their food, it makes more sense why they should not be eaten.<br>
But, when this was written, they did not have all of this knowledge that would help to explain why it would be bad to eat these creatures.<br>
They just had to trust that, father knows best, and to obey his commandments.<br>
The Jewish people never got the black plague because of obeying the commandments.<br>
Here are some of the commandments that kept the rats away from their homes.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 23, KJV, verses 12, 13 and 14<br>
12 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:<br>
13 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, (when thou sittest down to ease thyself abroad) thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:<br>
14 For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee. (that he see no nakedness of any thing in thee, and turn away from thee.)<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 23, NLT, verses 12, 13 and 14<br>
12 "You must have a designated area outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself. <br>
13 Each of you must have a spade as part of your equipment. Whenever you relieve yourself, dig a hole with the spade and cover the excrement. <br>
14 The camp must be holy, for the Lord your God moves around in your camp to protect you and to defeat your enemies. He must not see any shameful thing among you, or he will turn away from you.<br>
<br>
Numbers 19 KJV<br>
11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man (of any soul of man) shall be unclean seven days.<br>
12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.<br>
13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.<br>
14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.<br>
15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.<br>
16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.<br>
17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes (the dust) of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel (and living waters shall be given thereto in a vessel):<br>
18 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:<br>
19 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.<br>
20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the Lord: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.<br>
21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.<br>
22 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 19, NLT<br>
11 "All those who touch a dead human body will be ceremonially unclean for seven days. <br>
12 They must purify themselves on the third and seventh days with the water of purification; then they will be purified. But if they do not do this on the third and seventh days, they will continue to be unclean even after the seventh day. <br>
13 All those who touch a dead body and do not purify themselves in the proper way defile the Lord's Tabernacle, and they will be cut off from the community of Israel. Since the water of purification was not sprinkled on them, their defilement continues.<br>
14 "This is the ritual law that applies when someone dies inside a tent: All those who enter that tent and those who were inside when the death occurred will be ceremonially unclean for seven days. <br>
15 Any open container in the tent that was not covered with a lid is also defiled. <br>
16 And if someone in an open field touches the corpse of someone who was killed with a sword or who died a natural death, or if someone touches a human bone or a grave, that person will be defiled for seven days.<br>
17 "To remove the defilement, put some of the ashes from the burnt purification offering in a jar, and pour fresh water over them. <br>
18 Then someone who is ceremonially clean must take a hyssop branch and dip it into the water. That person must sprinkle the water on the tent, on all the furnishings in the tent, and on the people who were in the tent; also on the person who touched a human bone, or touched someone who was killed or who died naturally, or touched a grave. <br>
19 On the third and seventh days the person who is ceremonially clean must sprinkle the water on those who are defiled. Then on the seventh day the people being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe themselves, and that evening they will be cleansed of their defilement.<br>
20 "But those who become defiled and do not purify themselves will be cut off from the community, for they have defiled the sanctuary of the Lord. Since the water of purification has not been sprinkled on them, they remain defiled. <br>
21 This is a permanent law for the people. Those who sprinkle the water of purification must afterward wash their clothes, and anyone who then touches the water used for purification will remain defiled until evening. <br>
22 Anything and anyone that a defiled person touches will be ceremonially unclean until evening."<br>

<br>
That is the end of our short, little sample of some of the 613 commandments.<br>
Did you memorise the rest of them?<br>
Again, there are a total of 613 commandments in the Old Testament. No one has ever been able to obey them all, except Jesus.<br>
Jesus took all 613 commandments, which includes the Ten Commandments, and he tried to summarise them all down into just two.<br>
<br>
All of the Ten Commandments fell into one of the following two categories. You could just obey and follow the following two commandments, and, as a natural result of doing so, or trying your best to do so, you would likely end up obeying all of Ten Commandments.<br>
<br>
Matthew 22 (KJV)<br>
35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,<br>
36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?<br>
37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<br>
38 This is the first and great commandment.<br>
39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<br>
<br>
Matthew 22 (NLT)<br>
35 One of them, an expert in religious law, tried to trap him with this question: <br>
36 "Teacher, which is the most important commandment in the law of Moses?"<br>
37 Jesus replied, "'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.' (Deut 6:5.) <br>
38 This is the first and greatest commandment. <br>
39 A second is equally important: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' (Lev 19:18.)<br>
40 The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments."<br>
<br>
Let's look at the places where these two greatest commandments were originally found in the Old Testament.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 6:5<br>
KJV<br>
5 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.<br>
NLT<br>
5 And you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 6 KJV -- verses 1 through 7<br>
1 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgements, which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it (that ye might do them in the land whither ye pass over to possess it).<br>
2 That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.<br>
3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.<br>
4 Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord:<br>
5 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.<br>
6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:<br>
7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, (And thou shalt whet or sharpen them diligently unto thy children) and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 6 NLT verses 1 through 9<br>
1 "These are the commands, decrees, and regulations that the Lord your God commanded me to teach you. You must obey them in the land you are about to enter and occupy, <br>
2 and you and your children and grandchildren must fear the Lord your God as long as you live. If you obey all his decrees and commands, you will enjoy a long life. <br>
3 Listen closely, Israel, and be careful to obey. Then all will go well with you, and you will have many children in the land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you.<br>
4 "Listen, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord alone.<br>
(The Lord our God is one Lord;)<br>
(The Lord our God, the Lord is one;)<br>
(The Lord is our God, the Lord is one.)<br>
5 And you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength. <br>
6 And you must commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these commands that I am giving you today. <br>
7 Repeat them again and again to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting up. <br>
8 Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders. <br>
9 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 6:4 NLT<br>
The original Hebrew of verse 4 could be interpreted in any of the following ways:<br>
verse 4<br>
"Listen, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord alone.<br>
The Lord our God is one Lord; (KJV did that one)<br>
The Lord our God, the Lord is one;<br>
The Lord is our God, the Lord is one.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  I want to take a moment to focus on how important it is to teach these commandments to your children.<br>
There is a verse that we just now looked at...<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 6:7 (KJV)<br>
And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.<br>
NLT:<br>
7 Repeat them again and again to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting up. <br>
<br>
<br>
3 John 1:4 (KJV)<br>
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.<br>
NLT:<br>
I could have no greater joy than to hear that my children are following the truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Kings 2:4 (KJV)<br>
4 That the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.<br>
<br>
1 Kings 2, NLT, verses 3 and 4, (King David, getting old and close to death, is talking to his son, Solomon, who is going to become king soon.)<br>
3 Observe the requirements of the Lord your God, and follow all his ways. Keep the decrees, commands, regulations, and laws written in the Law of Moses so that you will be successful in all you do and wherever you go. <br>
4 If you do this, then the Lord will keep the promise he made to me. He told me, 'If your descendants live as they should and follow me faithfully with all their heart and soul, one of them will always sit on the throne of Israel.'<br>
<br>
<br>
2 John 1:4 (KJV)<br>
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.<br>
NLT:<br>
How happy I was to meet some of your children and find them living according to the truth, just as the Father commanded.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 3:18 (KJV)<br>
My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.<br>
1 John 3, NLT, verses 18, 19 and 20:<br>
18 Dear children, let's not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions. <br>
19 Our actions will show that we belong to the truth, so we will be confident when we stand before God. <br>
20 Even if we feel guilty, God is greater than our feelings, and he knows everything.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Being saved is not a feeling or emotion.  Since the day I was saved, there have been many days when I did not feel saved.<br>
<br>
We are looking at the places in the Old Testament where the two greatest commandments were originally mentioned.<br>
Here is where we are first told, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lev 19:18<br>
KJV<br>
18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord.<br>
NLT<br>
18 "Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against a fellow Israelite, but love your neighbour as yourself. I am the Lord.<br>

<p>
<br>
Judgement and Your Heart<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Let's talk about your heart.  Why? Because, the Bible says a lot about your heart.<br>
What you desire and consider to be valuable is in your heart.<br>
Those that say they are just window shopping or just looking at the menu but not ordering anything had better watch out.<br>
Because what is going on in your heart can become your treasure, and what you treasure will become the desires of your heart.<br>
That's why God judges what he sees when he looks at your heart.<br>
<br>
Psalms 10:4 (KJV)<br>
KJV 4 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.<br>
NLT<br>
4 The wicked are too proud to seek God. They seem to think that God is dead.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 21:4 (KJV)<br>
KJV 4 An high look, and a proud heart, and the ploughing of the wicked, is sin.<br>
NLT<br>
4 Haughty eyes, a proud heart, and evil actions are all sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17:9 (KJV)<br>
9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?<br>
10 I the Lord search the heart....<br>
NLT<br>
verse 9<br>
"The human heart is the most deceitful of all things,<br>
and desperately wicked.<br>
Who really knows how bad it is?<br>
10 <br>
But I, the Lord, search all hearts<br>
and examine secret motives.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 14:1 (KJV)<br>
1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.<br>
NLT<br>
1<br>
Only fools say in their hearts,<br>
"There is no God."<br>
They are corrupt, and their actions are evil;<br>
not one of them does good!<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 53:1 (KJV)<br>

Judgement<br>
<br>
Judgement is not merely limited to your external, physical, visual actions.<br>
<br>
Judgement includes everything that you have ever thought about or imagined in your mind, or secretly desired or fantasised about.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 16:7 (KJV)<br>
...the Lord seeth not as man seeth; (for man looketh on the eyes) for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 16, NLT, verses 6 and 7:<br>
6 When they arrived, Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought, "Surely this is the Lord's anointed!"<br>
7 But the Lord said to Samuel, "Don't judge by his appearance or height, for I have rejected him. The Lord doesn't see things the way you see them. People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:13 (KJV)<br>
13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4, verses 12 and 13 (NLT)<br>
12 For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires. <br>
13 Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he is the one to whom we are accountable.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The forbidden fruit was knowledge of good and evil all mixed up and mixed together.<br>
The Bible is the sword that sorts it back out again, helping you see what is good and what is evil.<br>
<br>
The mix-up caused by Satan's forbidden fruit is un-mixed by the Sword of the Sprit.<br>
The Bible helps us clearly see again what is right and wrong, good and evil, true and false.<br>
The knowledge of good and evil was all mixed together into the forbidden fruit, so that you could no longer tell the difference between good and evil.<br>
That's why Jesus said to the Father to forgive them, because they know not what they do.<br>
The forbidden fruit was the poison that brought sin into us.  Jesus is the antidote that gets the sin out of us.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When you are saved, Jesus dwells and lives in your heart, and he keeps it.<br>
<br>
Matthew 13:55 (KJV)<br>
KJV <br>
55 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?<br>
NLT<br>
54 When (Jesus) taught there in the synagogue, everyone was amazed and said, "Where does he get this wisdom and the power to do miracles?" <br>
55 Then they scoffed, "He's just the carpenter's son, and we know Mary, his mother, and his brothers -- James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas. <br>
56 All his sisters live right here among us. Where did he learn all these things?"<br>
<br>
Mark 6:3 (KJV)<br>
KJV 3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Judas, and Simon?<br>
NLT<br>
3 Then they scoffed, "He's just a carpenter, the son of Mary (He's just the son of the carpenter and of Mary,) and the brother of James, Joseph, (Joseph's name is also written as Joses) Judas, and Simon. <br>

Commentary:  A good, passionate carpenter loves to remodel, doing demolition on that which is not up to code, remodelling and fixing what needs to be repaired, and creating, expanding and constructing that which does not exist.<br>
<br>
The carpenter can't remodel your home if you don't let Him come inside. The carpenter stands at the door and knock, knock, knocks, but you need to let him come inside so he can remodel your heart, His forever home.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12:2<br>
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.<br>
NLT, verses 1 and 2<br>
And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us.<br>
We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus, (Jesus, the originator and perfecter of our faith) the champion who initiates and perfects our faith. Because of the joy awaiting him, he endured the cross, disregarding its shame. Now he is seated in the place of honour beside God's throne. <br>

There was a Christian band called, Third Day, that had a popular song which had a part that was based on the NIV of Psalms 57, verse 10, and also the NIV of Psalms 36, verses 5 and 6.<br>
<br>
<br>
The NIV of Psalms 57, verse 10:<br>
For great is your love, reaching to the heavens;<br>
your faithfulness reaches to the skies.<br>
<br>
The Third Day song was titled, "Your Love Oh Lord", originally relased on 24 August 1999 on their third studio album, Time.<br>
We will actually take a look at that song, and read the lyrics of that song,<br>
when we get to Christian Essays 16.<br>

<br>
We are looking at, when God sees and judges us, we are trying to see the way how the Lord sees us.<br>
<br>
<br>
The judgement goes all the way into the heart, mind and soul.<br>
Everything you have ever thought about, imagined in your mind, or secretly desired, is all subject to judgement.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, as a Christian who has done Romans 10:9, Christ's light, perfection, glory, salvation and forgiveness also goes all the way into there as well.<br>
<br>
Christ selected two commandments from the Ten Commandments, and used them as examples to show us what God's judgement would look like if God can see everything secretly inside of you...<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5<br>
21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgement:<br>
22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.<br>
<br>
NLT<br>
21 "You have heard that our ancestors were told, 'You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgement.<br>
(referring to Exod 20:13 and Deut 5:17.)<br>
22 But I say, if you are even angry with someone, (even angry with someone without cause,) you are subject to judgement! If you call someone an idiot, (of if you say to your brother, 'Raca', which is an Aramaic term of contempt) you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone, (if you say to someone, 'You fool') you are in danger of the fires of hell. (you are in danger of the fires of Gehenna.)<br>
<br>
Exod 20:13<br>
13 Thou shalt not kill.<br>
<br>
Deut 5:17 -- <br>
17 Thou shalt not kill.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5<br>
27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:<br>
28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.<br>
<br>
Matthew 5 NLT<br>
27 "You have heard the commandment that says, 'You must not commit adultery'. (which is a quote from Exodus 20:14 and Deuteronomy 5:18.) <br>
28 But I say, anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. <br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2:9 (KJV)<br>
KJV 9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;<br>
NLT:<br>
9 And I want women to be modest in their appearance. (I want women to pray in modest apparel.) They should wear decent and appropriate clothing and not draw attention to themselves by the way they fix their hair or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes. <br>
10 For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4:16 (NLT)<br>
For evil people can't sleep until they've done their evil deed for the day. They can't rest until they've caused someone to stumble.<br>
<br>
Luke 17:1 (NLT)<br>
One day Jesus said to his disciples, "There will always be temptations to sin, but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting!<br>
Luke 17:2 (NLT)<br>
It would be better to be thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to fall into sin.<br>
<br>
Matthew 18:7 (NLT)<br>
"What sorrow awaits the world, because it tempts people to sin. Temptations are inevitable, but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting.<br>
<br>
Mark 9:42 (NLT)<br>
"But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin, it would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone hung around your neck.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 4:17 (KJV)<br>
KJV 17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.<br>

17 Remember, it is sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it.<br>
<br>
When you have done Romans 10:9, and you know you are saved, instead of judgement and justice, you get forgiveness, grace, mercy and eternal life.<br>

We have been doing a Bible Study that looks at the Commandments in the Bible.<br>
<br>
Here is Moses remembering the Ten Commandments again...<br>
Deuteronomy 5<br>
KJV<br>
1 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgements which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them. (and keep to do them.)<br>
2 The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.<br>
3 The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.<br>
4 The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,<br>
5 (I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to shew you the word of the Lord: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,<br>
6 I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. (from the house of servants.)<br>
7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.<br>
8 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:<br>
9 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,<br>
10 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.<br>
11 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.<br>
12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.<br>
13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:<br>
14 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.<br>
15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.<br>
16 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.<br>
17 Thou shalt not kill.<br>
18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.<br>
19 Neither shalt thou steal.<br>
20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.<br>
21 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Deuteronomy 5<br>
1 Moses called all the people of Israel together and said, "Listen carefully, Israel. Hear the decrees and regulations I am giving you today, so you may learn them and obey them!<br>
2 "The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Mount Sinai. (The Hebrew name was Mount Horeb, which is another name for Sinai.) <br>
3 The Lord did not make this covenant with our ancestors, but with all of us who are alive today. <br>
4 At the mountain the Lord spoke to you face to face from the heart of the fire. <br>
5 I stood as an intermediary between you and the Lord, for you were afraid of the fire and did not want to approach the mountain. He spoke to me, and I passed his words on to you. This is what he said:<br>
6 "I am the Lord your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place of your slavery.<br>
7 "You must not have any other god but me.<br>
8 "You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind, or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea. <br>
9 You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected—even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me. <br>
10 But I lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those (for thousands of those) who love me and obey my commands.<br>
11 "You must not misuse the name of the Lord your God. The Lord will not let you go unpunished if you misuse his name.<br>
12 "Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you. <br>
13 You have six days each week for your ordinary work, <br>
14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the Lord your God. On that day no one in your household may do any work. This includes you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, your oxen and donkeys and other livestock, and any foreigners living among you. All your male and female servants must rest as you do. <br>
15 Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt, but the Lord your God brought you out with his strong hand and powerful arm. That is why the Lord your God has commanded you to rest on the Sabbath day.<br>
16 "Honour your father and mother, as the Lord your God commanded you. Then you will live a long, full life in the land the Lord your God is giving you.<br>
17 "You must not murder.<br>
18 "You must not commit adultery.<br>
19 "You must not steal.<br>
20 "You must not testify falsely against your neighbour.<br>
21 "You must not covet your neighbour's wife. You must not covet your neighbour's house or land, male or female servant, ox or donkey, or anything else that belongs to your neighbour.<br>
22 "The Lord spoke these words to all of you assembled there at the foot of the mountain. He spoke with a loud voice from the heart of the fire, surrounded by clouds and deep darkness. This was all he said at that time, and he wrote his words on two stone tablets and gave them to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Ten Commandments are not multiple choice!<br>
Do you think you have them all down?<br>
<br>
<br>
There is none righteous, no not one, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.<br>
There are 613 commandments in the Old Testament. No one ever obeyed them all perfectly, except Jesus.<br>
The one who could do them all perfectly lives in your heart, and He can give you victory over all sin, because He had victory over all sin on the cross.<br>
<br>
By the way, 613 is a prime number.<br>
Prime numbers are the building blocks of whole numbers,<br>

<br>
There are many examples where the Old Testament gives the commandment, and then the New Testament takes it to a higher, more in-depth level of an explanation as to why it is harmful and destructive to not obey that commandment.<br>
The New Testament gives us an enhanced look, going deeper into the stories and commandments of the Old Testament.<br>
Here is one example of this.<br>
<br>
Genesis 9:3 -- after the flood was over and Noah and the animals were all out of the Ark...<br>
1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.<br>
2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.<br>
3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.<br>
NLT:<br>
1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons and told them, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth. <br>
2 All the animals of the earth, all the birds of the sky, all the small animals that scurry along the ground, and all the fish in the sea will look on you with fear and terror. I have placed them in your power. <br>
3 I have given them to you for food, just as I have given you grain and vegetables. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4, verses 1, 2 and 3 (KJV)<br>
1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;<br>
2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;<br>
3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4: 1-3 -- NLT:
1 Now the Holy Spirit tells us clearly that in the last times some will turn away from the true faith; they will follow deceptive spirits and teachings that come from demons. <br>
2 These people are hypocrites and liars, and their consciences are dead.<br>
(These people are hypocrites and liars, and their consciences are seared.)
(Their consciences have become callous, without any feeling.)
3 They will say it is wrong to be married and wrong to eat certain foods. But God created those foods to be eaten with thanks by faithful people who know the truth. <br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Looking real quick at the Longman, Chambers and Cambridge Dictionaries,<br>
When part of your skin is callous, it is thick and tough and has almost no feeling.<br>
When a person is callous, he or she is not caring that other people are suffering, being unconcerned for the feelings of others.<br>
Your conscience is the part of your mind that tells you whether what you are doing is morally right or wrong.<br>
Conscience is not the same thing as consciousness, which is the condition of being awake and aware of things.<br>
But isn't it interesting how people talk about Christians being awoke, or awake or asleep?<br>
Maybe there is connection between knowing right and wrong, and being awake and aware or asleep and not caring about doing what is right and not caring about staying away from what is wrong?<br>
To sear is to scorch, to dry out or wither, to make someone callous or unfeeling,<br>
To sear is to burn something with a sudden powerful heat,<br>
When you sear meat, you cook the outside of a piece of meat quickly at a high temperature, in order to keep its juices in.<br>
To sear someone is to have a strong unpleasant effect on someone's feelings or memories.<br>
To sear is to dry out and wither.<br>
When you read and study the Bible, the Torah, day and night, Psalms 1:3 promises that your leaf also shall not wither;<br>
What would happen to the leaf of a tree if it is far away from the rivers of water?<br>
What would happen to you, and how would you feel if you stopped drinking water?<br>
Your Bible is your true source of living water and the Bread of Eternal Life!<br>
With a little bit of Commentary inserted here in Psalms 1: 3 & 4 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
2 But his delight is in (studying the Bible, His Law) the Torah of the Lord (Yaw-Who-Wah), And he meditates in (the Bible, His Law) His Torah day and night.<br>
3 For (when you do that, you shall be) he shall be as a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That yields its fruit in its season (not your season, in His season, not when you say when, it's when He says when), And whose leaf does not wither, And whatever he does prospers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: In the Old Testament, the Lord commands us to eat meat.  In the New Testament, we are told that, one of the ways how you can tell when someone is deceived and is following the seductions, doctrines and teachings of devils and demons, is that they will do two things.  They will say negative things about marriage and encourage sexually immoral relationships, like the boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, instead of marriage, and they will tell other people to not eat meat. <br>
These two Bible verses, Genesis 9:3 and 1 Timothy 4:3 are both in direct opposition to being a vegetarian. <br>
What does the Bible say about being a vegetarian?  There it is, right there.<br>
Commentary: For some spiritual reason, being a vegetarian can make you vulnerable to spiritual attacks, deceptions, and seductions, and can cause you to go in a direction that could eventually be harmful and destructive.<br>
Instead of trying to understand all of this, or finding out the hard way why this warning is here, it would be better to just trust and obey, and trust in the Lord, knowing that Father knows best. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Another example would be the commandment of obeying the Sabbath.  It basically means not to do your normal, occupational work on one particular day of the week, to have one day per week designated as a day of rest.  Jesus looked at that commandment, and gave some insight into it.  Basically, Jesus taught that, yes, the Sabbath is good and should be obeyed, but there may be situations when the Sabbath may need to stopped for at least a part of that day to do some things that need to be done when it involves the health and safety of others.  He taught how, the Sabbath is not to be something religious, to be worshiped in and of itself, to the point where people become extremely ridiculous about trying to follow it. <br>
<br>
Two examples would be, a priest is required to circumcise a baby boy exactly eight days after he is born, as it says there in Genesis 17:12.  If the eighth day falls on the Sabbath, a priest will need to perform the circumcision on that day and do that work even if it is on the Sabbath.  Also, if a child falls into a well on the Sabbath, others will need to stop their Sabbath at least long enough to rescue the child. Jesus taught about this because people were worshiping the Sabbath, and were taking it so seriously that they would be willing to not help others because their help was needed on the Sabbath.  <br>
<br>
A Bible Study of the Sabbath is a big thing to study. So, without trying to get into it too much, I am just trying to briefly mention it here. For now, we can see that the Old Testament commandment is looked at and taken to a more in-depth analysis by Jesus in the New Testament. Jesus did this with several of the Old Testament commandments. <br>
<br>
Before with leave this brief look at the Sabbath, it is interesting how a Sabbath Bible Study can go on and on.  For example, doing work on a Sabbath includes kindling or creating a fire (Exodus 35:3).  That is considered work and should not be done on the Sabbath, yet that is how gasoline cars work.  They continuously use spark plugs to kindle a tiny spark of fire to ignite the gasoline that makes the motor run. Even in Israel today, the lifts or elevators are programmed on the Sabbath to always stop on every floor, so that no one has to push a button, because some people think that pushing a button would be considered doing work on the Sabbath.  I guess that would mean that no one answers their phone on the Sabbath, because that would involve swiping or pushing a button.  I hope no one needs to use the toilet on a Sabbath!  Jesus was showing us not to be so ridiculous and religious with it.  We are not to lord-over the Sabbath and try to be lords of the Sabbath.  Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath, not us.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Lord might use Angels, but we are not to be giving angels special attention or worth.<br>
We are to worship the Lord.  We are not to be worshipping the angels.<br>
When people make videos and TV shows that give glory, honour, attention and value to the angels, be careful with things like that.<br>
It's like giving value and worth to the person that delivers a parcel to you, instead of the person that sent the parcel.<br>
Do you send a thank-you card to the person that delivered the gift to your home, or do you send a thank-you card to the person that sent the gift?<br>
When someone you love returns home, do you give that person a hug, or do you try to hug their shadow that you see on the ground?<br>
Do you focus on the shadow that you see, or the person that is making the shadow?<br>
That is the difference between worshipping the Lord, and worshipping an angel that is just working for the Lord, and is just there to carry out His commands.<br>
<br>
Additionally, in regards to what we were looking at earlier, eating meat or being a vegetarian, and which day to have the Sabbath, and how strict you should be in observing the Sabbath, we should not be judging others based on these things, as we shall see here in Colossians 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 2:16-19 (KJV)<br>
16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:<br>
17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.<br>
18 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,<br>
19 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 2:16-19 (NLT)<br>
16 So don't let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths.<br>
17 For these rules are only shadows of the reality yet to come. And Christ himself is that reality.<br>
18 Don't let anyone condemn you by insisting on pious self-denial or the worship of angels (worshiping with angels), saying they have had visions about these things. Their sinful minds have made them proud,<br>
19 and they are not connected to Christ, the head of the body. For he holds the whole body together with its joints and ligaments, and it grows as God nourishes it.<br>

<br>
New Testament Commandments<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Old Testament commandments were law.  In many cases, those that disobeyed the Old Testament commandments were taken outside the city and killed.<br>
They would throw rocks at them, hitting them with rocks until they were dead.<br>
<br>
The teachings of Jesus are not thought of as commandments, but as teachings.<br>
Jesus was not trying to add to the list of commandments.<br>
He took the Old Testament commandments and took them to a higher, enhanced level, giving further insight on them.<br>
Jesus came to provide a way to be saved and forgiven and live forever in Heaven even though no one can perfectly obey all of the commandments all of the time.<br>
<br>
There are two authors that took all the teachings of Jesus and made a list of them.<br>
They call their lists, the commandments of Jesus, but that may not be the best way to describe them.<br>
These lists are a great way to go through all the teachings of Jesus in a simple, list format.<br>
It is good to try your best to obey and do what Jesus is telling us to do.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you were to just read straight through all of the New Testament, you would encounter all of these teachings of Jesus anyway, especially, in the gospels, the first four books of the New Testament, the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.<br>
<br>
After going through the New Testament, the first author came up with 38, and the second author came up with 49 commandments of Jesus.<br>
<br>
Here is the list that the first author made.<br>
The commandments of Jesus from the New Testament.<br>
38 commandments given by Jesus in the New Testament.<br>

<br>
Samuel Mills compiled this list of 38 commandments of Jesus<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Commandments of Jesus <br>
From the Four Gospels<br>
<br>
<br>
1. "When you stand praying, forgive"<br>
<br>
"And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins." But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your sins." (Mark 11:25-26 NIV)<br>
<br>
2. "You must be born again"<br>
<br>
"You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again." (John 3:7 KJV)<br>
<br>
3. "Remain in Me and I will remain in you"<br>
<br>
When you ask Jesus into your heart and He becomes your Lord and Saviour, the Holy Spirit lives in you, and you in Him. Here Jesus uses a grapevine to compare our relationship with Him. "Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me." ( John 15:4 NIV)<br>
<br>
4. "Let your light shine before men"<br>
<br>
"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. " In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven," (Matt 5:14;16 NIV).<br>
<br>
5. "Settle matters quickly with your adversary"<br>
<br>
"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it whilst you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison." (Matt 5:25 NIV)<br>
<br>
6. "Get rid of whatever causes you to sin"<br>
<br>
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell." (Matt 5:29-30 NIV)<br>
<br>
7. "Do Not Swear at All"<br>
<br>
"But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." (Matt 5: 34-37, KJV)<br>
<br>
8. "Do Not Resist an Evil Person"<br>
<br>
(Turning the other cheek.)<br>
<br>
"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also," (Matt 5:38-39 NIV).<br>
<br>
9. "Giving More than is Demanded"<br>
<br>
(Going the extra mile)<br>
<br>
"And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you," (Matt 5:40-42 NIV).<br>
<br>
10. "Love Your Enemies"<br>
<br>
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous," (Matt 5:43-45 NIV).<br>
<br>
11. "Give to Please God, Not to be Seen"<br>
<br>
"Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven," (Matt 6:1 NIV).<br>
<br>
12. "Pray Privately, Not to be Seen by Men"<br>
<br>
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words," <br>
(Matt 6:5-7 NIV).<br>
<br>
13. "This, then, is how you should pray"<br>
<br>
"This, then, is how you should pray: " 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'<br>
<br>
For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins," (Matt 6:9-15 NIV).<br>
<br>
14. "Fast Without Fanfare"<br>
<br>
"When you fast, do not look sombre as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full," (Matt 6:16 NIV).<br>
<br>
15. "Do not Store up Treasures on Earth"<br>
<br>
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also," <br>
(Matt 6:19-21 NIV).<br>
<br>
16. "Do not Worry about Your Needs"<br>
<br>
"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?" (Matt 6:25-26 NIV). <br>
<br>
17. "Do not Worry about Tomorrow"<br>
<br>
"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own," (Matt 6:34 NIV).<br>
<br>
18. "Place God First"<br>
<br>
"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you," (Matt 6:33 NIV).<br>
<br>
19. "Do not Judge"<br>
<br>
"Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you," <br>
(Matt 7:1-2 NIV).<br>
<br>
20. "Guard what is Sacred"<br>
<br>
"Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces," <br>
(Matt 7:6 NIV).<br>
<br>
21. "Ask, Seek, and Knock"<br>
<br>
"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you," <br>
(Matt 7:7 NIV).<br>
<br>
22. "Care for Those in Distress"<br>
<br>
"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me," <br>
(Matt 25:34-36 NIV).<br>
<br>
23. "Enter Through the Narrow Gate"<br>
<br>
"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it," <br>
(Matt 7:13-14 NIV).<br>
<br>
24. "Watch out for false prophets"<br>
<br>
"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves," (Matt 7:15 NIV).<br>
<br>
25. "Exercise Spiritual Power"<br>
<br>
"He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness," (Matt 10:1 NIV).<br>
<br>
"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give," (Matt 10:8 NIV)."<br>
<br>
26. "Do not Despise Childlike Believers"<br>
<br>
"See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven," (Matt 18:10 NIV). Commandments of Jesus<br>
<br>
27. "Do not Exalt Yourself"<br>
<br>
"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only one Master and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ. The greatest among you will be your servant. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted," (Matt 23:8-12 NIV).<br>
<br>
28. "Settle Disputes Between Believers in this Manner..."<br>
<br>
"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector,"
(Matt 18:15-17 NIV).<br>
<br>
29. "Do not Oppose Other Christian Groups"<br>
<br>
"Teacher," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us."<br>
<br>
"Do not stop him," Jesus said. "No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, for whoever is not against us is for us," (Mark 9:38-40 NIV).<br>
<br>
30. "Have Complete Faith in God"<br>
<br>
"Have faith in God," Jesus answered. "I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours," (Mark 11:22-24 NIV).<br>
<br>
31. "Do as the Good Samaritan Did"<br>
<br>
"The expert in the law replied, 'The one who had mercy on him.' Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise," <br>
(Luke 10:30-37 NIV). <br>
<br>
32. "Love One Another"<br>
<br>
(This commandment of Jesus summarises all the others.)<br>
<br>
"My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you," (John 15:12 KJV).<br>
<br>
33. "Do this in Remembrance of Me"<br>
<br>
"And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, 'This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.'"<br>
"In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you,'" (Luke 22:19-20 NIV).<br>
<br>
34. "You Should also Wash One Another's Feet"<br>

<br>
"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age," <br>
(Matt 28:19-20 NIV).<br>
<br>
37. "Obey What I Command"<br>
<br>
"If you love me, you will obey what I command," <br>
(John 14:15 NIV).<br>
<br>
38. "You Must be Ready"<br>

<br>
Another website counted 49 commandments of Christ.<br>
But some of those are basically the same or almost the same as the commandments already found in the Old Testament.<br>
Again, if you just read through the New Testament, especially, the gospels, the first four books of the New Testament, the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, you will encounter all of these teachings, and then some, all from Jesus Christ.<br>
And then, I suggest, that you keep going after that, and keep reading.  Keeping reading through your entire Bible and pray, every single day.<br>
Read your Bible and pray, every single day.<br>
Although we think of them as teachings, we should obey them, and seriously do them as if they were commandments.<br>
It would be very good for us, and for others, those around us, if we were to seriously follow, obey and do what Jesus is telling us to do!<br>

<br>
10. Love Your Enemies<br>
"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

<br>
12. Practice Secret Disciplines<br>
". . . When thou doest thine alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. . . . When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. . . . When thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly" (Matthew 6:1–18).<br>
<br>
13. Lay Up Treasures<br>
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matthew 6:19–21).<br>

<br>
15. Judge Not<br>
"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?" (Matthew 7:1–3).<br>
<br>

<br>
18. Do Unto Others<br>
"Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets" (Matthew 7:12).<br>
<br>
19. Choose the Narrow Way<br>
"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it" (Matthew 7:13–14).<br>
<br>
20. Beware of False Prophets<br>
"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?" (Matthew 7:15–16).<br>
<br>
21. Pray for Labourers<br>

<br>
26. Honour Your Parents<br>
"For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, he that curseth father or mother, let him die the death" (Matthew 15:4).<br>

<br>
28. Deny Yourself<br>
"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?" (Luke 9:23–25).<br>
<br>
29. Despise Not Little Ones<br>
"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 18:10).<br>
<br>
30. Go to Offenders<br>
"Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican" (Matthew 18:15–17).<br>
<br>
31. Beware of Covetousness<br>
"And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth" (Luke 12:15).<br>
<br>
32. Forgive Offenders<br>
"Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven" (Matthew 18:21–22).<br>
<br>
33. Honour Marriage<br>
"And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder" (Matthew 19:4–6).<br>
<br>
34. Be a Servant<br>
". . . Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many" (Matthew 20:26–28).<br>
<br>
35. Be a House of Prayer<br>
"It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer . . . " (Matthew 21:13).<br>
<br>
36. Ask in Faith<br>
"Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea: it shall be done. And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive" (Matthew 21:21–22).<br>
<br>
37. Bring In the Poor<br>
"Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just" (Luke 14:12–14).<br>
<br>
38. Render to Caesar<br>
"Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's" (Matthew 22:19–21).<br>
<br>
39. Love the Lord<br>
"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment" (Matthew 22:37–38).<br>
<br>
40. Love Your Neighbour<br>
"And the second [commandment] is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets" (Matthew 22:39–40).<br>
<br>
41. Await My Return<br>
"Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh" (Matthew 24:42–44).<br>
<br>
42. Take, Eat, and Drink<br>
"As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins" (Matthew 26:26–28).<br>
<br>
43. Be Born Again<br>
"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again" (John 3:5–7).<br>
<br>
44. Keep My Commandments<br>
"If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).<br>
<br>
45. Watch and Pray<br>
"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matthew 26:41).<br>
<br>
46. Feed My Sheep<br>
"So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jona, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jona, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep" (John 21:15–16).<br>
<br>
47. Baptise My Disciples<br>
"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost" (Matthew 28:19).<br>
<br>
48. Receive God's Power<br>
"And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high" (Luke 24:49).<br>
<br>
49. Make Disciples<br>
"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations . . . teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen" (Matthew 28:19–20).<br>

<a name="YAH3RESPONZ"></a><h2>Responding to Commandments</h2>
<p>
<br>
Responding to Commandments<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There are four main ways how one might respond to commandments...<br>
<br>
1. Those that obey<br>
<br>
2. Those that try to obey but sometimes make mistakes and accidentally disobey, but they know they are forgiven and they keep moving forward<br>
<br>
3. Those that make the deliberate decision to disobey on purpose, and try to keep on disobeying, knowing that it is wrong.<br>
<br>
4. Those that are trying to obey, they are not trying to do anything wrong, and yet they become the victim of someone else's sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's think about the first three of these.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 6:3<br>
KJV<br>
3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 6:3<br>
NLT<br>
Then the Lord said, "My Spirit will not put up with humans for such a long time (will not remain in humans for such a long time), for they are only mortal flesh. In the future, their normal lifespan will be no more than 120 years."<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 2, verse 8<br>
KJV<br>
8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:<br>
<br>
NLT<br>
8 Then the man of lawlessness will be revealed, but the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth and destroy him by the splendour of his coming.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  This is mainly talking about when the Anti-Christ comes on the scene in the end times, but the wording here is interesting, how it says that a wicked person of lawlessness shall be revealed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 32:23 (KJV)<br>
But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the Lord: and be sure your sin will find you out.<br>
NLT<br>
23 But if you fail to keep your word, then you will have sinned against the Lord, and you may be sure that your sin will find you out. <br>
<br>
Romans 5, verse 20 and 21, KJV<br>
20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:<br>
21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 6, verse 1 and 2, KJV<br>
1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?<br>
2 God forbid.<br>
<br>
Romans 6:15 KJV<br>
15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.<br>
<br>
Romans 6, verses 14 through 18, KJV<br>
14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.<br>
15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.<br>
16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?<br>
17 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.<br>
18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.<br>
<br>
Romans 5:20 & 21,  NLT<br>
20 God's law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God's wonderful grace became more abundant. <br>
21 So just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God's wonderful grace rules instead, giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>
<br>
Looking again at Romans 6, verses 1 and 2, then verses 14 through 23, NLT<br>
1 Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? <br>
2 Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it?<br>
<br>
14 Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God's grace.<br>
15 Well then, since God's grace has set us free from the law, does that mean we can go on sinning? Of course not! <br>
16 Don't you realise that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living. <br>
17 Thank God! Once you were slaves of sin, but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you. <br>
18 Now you are free from your slavery to sin, and you have become slaves to righteous living.<br>
19 Because of the weakness of your human nature, I am using the illustration of slavery to help you understand all this. Previously, you let yourselves be slaves to impurity and lawlessness, which led ever deeper into sin. Now you must give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy.<br>
20 When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the obligation to do right. <br>
21 And what was the result? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom. <br>
22 But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God. Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life.<br>
23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Just because we can go to heaven, even though we have not followed the law perfectly, does not mean that we can just ignore the law completely.<br>
The law is still in effect, and can still bring harm and destruction if not obeyed, even though you are saved, forgiven, and will be living forever in heaven.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, There are four main ways how one might respond to commandments...<br>
<br>
I will mention the first three again, and then talk about the fourth way of how one might respond to commandments...<br>
<br>
1. Those that obey<br>
<br>
2. Those that try to obey but sometimes make mistakes and accidentally disobey, but they know they are forgiven and they keep moving forward<br>
<br>
3. Those that make the deliberate decision to disobey on purpose, and try to keep on disobeying, knowing that it is wrong.<br>
<br>
Let's talk about this one here next.<br>
4. Those that are trying to obey, they are not trying to do anything wrong, and yet they become the victim of someone else's sin<br>
<br>
<br>
The Bible clearly tells us this, and we have studied some of this already.<br>
David was playing the harp, there in 1 Samuel, chapter 16, and King Saul tried to kill him with a spear, even though David did not do anything wrong at that time before David was king.<br>
Job had some disasters happen to him, and he did not do anything wrong.<br>
The governor of the land, Pontius Pilate, and the second thief on the cross, they both said that Jesus did not do anything wrong, and yet, there he was, whipped, beaten and hanging on a cross, crucified.<br>
<br>
Job, David before he was king, and Jesus -- bad things happened to them and they did not do anything wrong.<br>
Christians will have persecutions, troubles, trials and tribulations. Rain falls on the just and the unjust.<br>
Trying to obey the commandments can help improve your chances of a happier, healthier, and less stressful life.<br>
But, as we see with Job, David and Jesus, bad things can happen to someone even when they have not done anything wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:21 (KJV)<br>
KJV 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<br>
Matthew 6, verses 19 through 21, NLT<br>
19 "Don't store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal. <br>
20 Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. <br>
21 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.<br>
<br>
Luke 12:34 (KJV)<br>
KJV 34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<br>
Luke 12, verses 33 and 34, NLT<br>
33 "Sell your possessions and give to those in need. This will store up treasure for you in heaven! And the purses of heaven never get old or develop holes. Your treasure will be safe; no thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it. <br>
34 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.<br>
<br>
Psalms 37:4 (KJV)<br>
Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.<br>
<br>
Psalms 37:4 (NLT)<br>
Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you your heart's desires.<br>

<p>
<br>
Conclusion -- Choosing Blessings or Curses<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We are getting close to being done, here. Next, we will look at a chapter in the book of Deuteronomy, and then, take a look at a psalm, finish it off with a quick prayer, and then we will be all done with this Bible Study.<br>
<br>
The next part of this study is to look at the book of Deuteronomy, chapter 30.<br>
<br>
Look at the difference between obeying and disobeying the commandments.<br>
Compare the results of getting blessed by obeying, and getting cursed by disobeying.<br>
Yes, we can be saved under mercy and grace, but our life here will not be as long or as healthy or as happy as it could be.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 30<br>
KJV<br>
1 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee,<br>
2 And shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;<br>
3 That then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee.<br>
4 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:<br>
5 And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.<br>
6 And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.<br>
7 And the Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.<br>
8 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.<br>
9 And the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the Lord will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:<br>
10 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.<br>
11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.<br>
12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?<br>
13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?<br>
14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.<br>
15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;<br>
16 In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgements, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.<br>
17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;<br>
18 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.<br>
19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:<br>
20 That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 30<br>
NLT<br>
A Call to Return to the Lord<br>
1 "In the future, when you experience all these blessings and curses I have listed for you, and when you are living among the nations to which the Lord your God has exiled you, take to heart all these instructions. <br>
2 If at that time you and your children return to the Lord your God, and if you obey with all your heart and all your soul all the commands I have given you today, <br>
3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes. He will have mercy on you and gather you back from all the nations where he has scattered you. <br>
4 Even though you are banished to the ends of the earth, (or, to the ends of the heavens,) the Lord your God will gather you from there and bring you back again. <br>
5 The Lord your God will return you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will possess that land again. Then he will make you even more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors!<br>
6 "The Lord your God will change your heart (The Lord your God will circumcise your heart,) and the hearts of all your descendants, so that you will love him with all your heart and soul and so you may live! <br>
7 The Lord your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate and persecute you. <br>
8 Then you will again obey the Lord and keep all his commands that I am giving you today.<br>
9 "The Lord your God will then make you successful in everything you do. He will give you many children and numerous livestock, and he will cause your fields to produce abundant harvests, for the Lord will again delight in being good to you as he was to your ancestors. <br>
10 The Lord your God will delight in you if you obey his voice and keep the commands and decrees written in this Book of Instruction, and if you turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and soul.<br>
<br>
The Choice of Life or Death<br>
11 "This command I am giving you today is not too difficult for you, and it is not beyond your reach. <br>
12 It is not kept in heaven, so distant that you must ask, 'Who will go up to heaven and bring it down so we can hear it and obey?' <br>
13 It is not kept beyond the sea, so far away that you must ask, 'Who will cross the sea to bring it to us so we can hear it and obey?' <br>
14 No, the message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart so that you can obey it.<br>
15 "Now listen! Today I am giving you a choice between life and death, between prosperity and disaster. <br>
16 For I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to keep his commands, decrees, and regulations by walking in his ways. If you do this, you will live and multiply, and the Lord your God will bless you and the land you are about to enter and occupy.<br>
17 "But if your heart turns away and you refuse to listen, and if you are drawn away to serve and worship other gods, <br>
18 then I warn you now that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live a long, good life in the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy.<br>
19 "Today I have given you the choice between life and death, between blessings and curses. Now I call on heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Oh, that you would choose life, so that you and your descendants might live! <br>
20 You can make this choice by loving the Lord your God, obeying him, and committing yourself firmly to him. This is the key to your life. (He is the key to your life.) And if you love and obey the Lord, you will live long in the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."<br>
<br>
<br>
As we bring this Bible Study to a conclusion, the last thing we will look at here is Psalms 19.<br>
Again, the original Hebrew meanings are included here, enclosed in round brackets.<br>
Psalms 19 -- KJV<br>
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.<br>
1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.<br>
2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.<br>
3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.<br>
(There is no speech nor language without these their voice is heard.)<br>
(There is no speech nor language without their voice heard.)<br>
<br>
4 (Their rule, their direction) Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,<br>
5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.<br>
6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.<br>
7<br>
(The doctrine of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul:)<br>
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.<br>
8 The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.<br>
9 The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.<br>
(the judgements of the Lord are truth and righteous altogether.)<br>
10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.<br>
(sweeter also than honey and the dropping of honeycombs.)<br>
11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.<br>
12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.<br>
13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression (from much transgression).<br>
14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.<br>
(O Lord, my rock, and my redeemer.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 19 -- NLT<br>
For the choir director: A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
The heavens proclaim the glory of God.<br>
The skies display his craftsmanship.<br>
2<br>
Day after day they continue to speak;<br>
night after night they make him known.<br>
3<br>
They speak without a sound or word;<br>
their voice is never heard.<br>
(There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.)<br>
4<br>
Yet their message has gone throughout the earth,<br>
and their words to all the world.<br>
God has made a home in the heavens for the sun.<br>
5<br>
It bursts forth like a radiant bridegroom after his wedding.<br>
It rejoices like a great athlete eager to run the race.<br>
6<br>
The sun rises at one end of the heavens<br>
and follows its course to the other end.<br>
Nothing can hide from its heat.<br>
7<br>
The instructions of the Lord are perfect,<br>
reviving the soul.<br>
The decrees of the Lord are trustworthy,<br>
making wise the simple.<br>
8<br>
The commandments of the Lord are right,<br>
bringing joy to the heart.<br>
The commands of the Lord are clear,<br>
giving insight for living.<br>
9<br>
Reverence for the Lord is pure,<br>
lasting forever.<br>
The laws of the Lord are true;<br>
each one is fair.<br>
10<br>
They are more desirable than gold,<br>
even the finest gold.<br>
They are sweeter than honey,<br>
even honey dripping from the comb.<br>
11<br>
They are a warning to your servant,<br>
a great reward for those who obey them.<br>
12<br>
How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart?<br>
Cleanse me from these hidden faults.<br>
13<br>
Keep your servant from deliberate sins!<br>
Don't let them control me.<br>
Then I will be free of guilt<br>
and innocent of great sin.<br>
14<br>
May the words of my mouth<br>
and the meditation of my heart<br>
be pleasing to you,<br>
O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.<br>

<br>
Let's end this Bible study with a good prayer.<br>
<br>
Dear Lord, Jesus.   I call on the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ, to help me now, this day, and every day. Thank you for making it possible to live forever in Heaven with you even though I did not perfectly obey all of the commandments all of my life.<br>
Help me desire to follow and obey that which you say is good, and to stay far away all that you say is evil, harmful and destructive.<br>
Help me to walk in truth, guide me into all truth, and help me stay far away from addictions, enslavements, deceptions, people, places and activities (by it physical or electronically-generated places on the internet) that would be toxic and wasteful of my remaining days here on this earth.<br>
You tell me to make sure I teach my children these things you have commanded. Help me do that with anyone that needs to hear. Help me have your word written and remembered in my heart and mind.<br>
I thankfully receive your forgiveness, mercy, grace, and your gift of salvation and eternal life. Help me now to walk with you and follow The Way, all the days of my life.<br>
I ask for these things in the name of Jesus Christ, In Jesus' name, Amen.<br>
<br>

There is something really amazing and beautiful in Ezekiel 37.<br>
<br>
Just before this chapter here, chapter 37, it tells us there, in chapter 36, Ezekiel, with the gift to prophesy, was talking about the Restoration for Israel.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 37: 1-14 KJV<br>
1 The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,<br>
<br>
2 And caused me to pass by them round about: (and, behold, there were very many in the open champaign;) and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.<br>
<br>
3 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest.<br>
4 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.<br>
5 Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:<br>
6 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.<br>
7 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.<br>
8 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.<br>
<br>
(Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath,)<br>
9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.<br>
10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.<br>
11 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.<br>
12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.<br>
13 And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,<br>
14 And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 37: 1-14 NLT<br>
1 The Lord took hold of me, and I was carried away by the Spirit of the Lord to a valley filled with bones.<br>
2 He led me all around among the bones that covered the valley floor. They were scattered everywhere across the ground and were completely dried out.<br>
3<br>
Then he asked me, "Son of man, can these bones become living people again?"<br>
"O Sovereign Lord," I replied, "you alone know the answer to that."<br>
4<br>
Then he said to me, "Speak a prophetic message to these bones and say, 'Dry bones, listen to the word of the Lord!<br>
5 This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Look! I am going to put breath into you and make you live again!<br>
6 I will put flesh and muscles on you and cover you with skin. I will put breath into you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord.'"<br>
7 So I spoke this message, just as he told me. Suddenly as I spoke, there was a rattling noise all across the valley. The bones of each body came together and attached themselves as complete skeletons.<br>
8 Then as I watched, muscles and flesh formed over the bones. Then skin formed to cover their bodies, but they still had no breath in them.<br>
9 Then he said to me, "Speak a prophetic message to the winds, son of man. Speak a prophetic message and say, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Come, O breath, from the four winds! Breathe into these dead bodies so they may live again.'"<br>
10 So I spoke the message as he commanded me, and breath came into their bodies. They all came to life and stood up on their feet -- a great army.<br>
11 Then he said to me, "Son of man, these bones represent the people of Israel. They are saying, 'We have become old, dry bones -- all hope is gone. Our nation is finished.'<br>
12 Therefore, prophesy to them and say, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: O my people, I will open your graves of exile and cause you to rise again. Then I will bring you back to the land of Israel.<br>
13 When this happens, O my people, you will know that I am the Lord.<br>
14 I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live again and return home to your own land. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken, and I have done what I said. Yes, the Lord has spoken!'"<br>

<br>
Here are the words to the 2016 song, "Come Alive (Dry Bones)" from Lauren Daigle.<br>
<br>
<br>
Through the eyes of men it seems<br>
There's so much we have lost<br>
As we look down the road<br>
Where all the prodigals have walked<br>
One by one<br>
The enemy has whispered lies<br>
And led them off as slaves<br>
<br>
But we know that you are God<br>
Yours is the victory<br>
We know there is more to come<br>
That we may not yet see<br>
So with the faith you've given us<br>
We'll step into the valley unafraid, yeah<br>
<br>
As we call out to dry bones<br>
Come alive, come alive<br>
We call out to dead hearts<br>
Come alive, come alive<br>
Up out of the ashes<br>
Let us see an army rise<br>
We call out to dry bones, come alive<br>
<br>
God of endless mercy<br>
God of unrelenting love<br>
Rescue every daughter<br>
Bring us back the wayward son<br>
And By your spirit breathe upon them<br>
Show the world that you alone can save<br>
You alone can save<br>
<br>
As we call out to dry bones<br>
Come alive, come alive<br>
We call out to dead hearts<br>
Come alive, come alive<br>
Up out of the ashes<br>
Let us see an army rise<br>
We call out to dry bones come alive<br>
<br>
So breathe, oh breath of God<br>
Now breathe, oh breath of God<br>
Breathe, oh breath of God<br>
Now breathe<br>
<br>
Breathe, oh breath of God<br>
Now breathe, oh breath of God<br>
Breathe, oh breath of God, now breathe<br>
<br>
As we call out to dry bones<br>
Come alive, come alive<br>
We call out to dead hearts<br>
Come alive, come alive<br>
Up out of the ashes<br>
Let us see an army rise<br>
We call out to dry bones come alive, yeah<br>
We call out to dry bones, come alive<br>
<br>
Oh come alive<br>
<br>
<br>
