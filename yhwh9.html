<br>
All The Words<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All The Words<br>
<br>
Exodus 24:3 (KJV)<br>
And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all the judgements: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the Lord hath said will we do.<br>
<br>
Exodus 24:4 (KJV)<br>
And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: So what?  Big deal. What's so special about that?<br>
Do you ever feel that way as your read your Bible?<br>
What you might read in your Bible today as being unimportant, will someday be extremely important.<br>
Just wait.  You'll someday see that this is very true.<br>
It's important to read all the words in all of your Bible, even if you don't understand why it is important today.<br>
Because, one of the ways how satan begins an attack is to make you question every verse you read.<br>
That's what he first did with Eve in the Garden of Eden, back in Genesis.<br>
In Europe, it's called, the full stop. In America, it's called, a period.<br>
Take the full stop, that little dot, that period at the end of every sentence, and turn it into a question mark.<br>
That's what satan does with Scripture.<br>
Some people say that there are additional laws and commandments that were not written down, that are passed down only by spoken word of mouth, from generation to generation.<br>
But if that was true, then Moses would be a liar, and the Bible would not be true, because Moses said that he wrote down all the words of the Lord, not some, not half, not most, but all of them.<br>
You see?  That little spot right there in Exodus 24 really is important after all.<br>
Every verse and every chapter in your Bible is very important, even if you don't understand why.<br>
If you don't agree, satan will come along to help you learn this the hard way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 34:27 KJV<br>
27 And the Lord said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.<br>
<br>

<br>
Joshua 8: 34 & 35 (KJV)<br>
34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.<br>
35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, (and the strangers that walked amongst them,) and the strangers that were conversant amongst them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 8:34 & 35 NLT<br>
34 Joshua then read to them all the blessings and curses Moses had written in the Book of Instruction. <br>

Isaiah 46: 9 & 10 KJV<br>
9 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,<br>
10 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:<br>
<br>
Isaiah 46: 9 & 10 NLT<br>
9<br>
Remember the things I have done in the past.<br>
For I alone am God!<br>
I am God, and there is none like me.<br>
10<br>
Only I can tell you the future<br>
before it even happens.<br>
Everything I plan will come to pass,<br>
for I do whatever I wish.<br>

Proverbs 18: 1-3 (KJV)<br>
(He that separateth himself seeketh according to his desire, and intermeddleth in every business.)<br>
1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.<br>
2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.<br>
3 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 18: 1-3 NLT<br>
1<br>
Unfriendly people care only about themselves;<br>
they lash out at common sense.<br>
2<br>
Fools have no interest in understanding;<br>
they only want to air their own opinions.<br>
3<br>
Doing wrong leads to disgrace,<br>
and scandalous behaviour brings contempt.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 107: 38-43 (KJV)<br>
38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.<br>
39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.<br>
(He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the void place.)<br>
40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.<br>
(Yet setteth he the poor on high after affliction,)<br>
41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.<br>
42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.<br>
43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 107: 38-43 NLT<br>
Psalms 107 is the beginning of Psalms Book Five (Psalms 107–150)<br>
38<br>
How he blesses them!<br>
They raise large families there,<br>
and their herds of livestock increase.<br>
39<br>
When they decrease in number and become impoverished<br>
through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,<br>
40<br>
the Lord pours contempt on their princes,<br>
causing them to wander in trackless wastelands.<br>
41<br>
But he rescues the poor from trouble<br>
and increases their families like flocks of sheep.<br>
42<br>
The godly will see these things and be glad,<br>
whilst the wicked are struck silent.<br>
43<br>
Those who are wise will take all this to heart;<br>
they will see in our history the faithful love of the Lord.<br>
<br>

Psalms 123: All of Psalms 123, All 4 verses (KJV)<br>
A Song of degrees.<br>
1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.<br>
2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us.<br>
3 Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.<br>
4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.<br>
<br>
<br>
All of Psalms 123<br>
A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem.<br>
NLT:<br>
1<br>
I lift my eyes to you,<br>
O God, enthroned in heaven.<br>
2<br>
We keep looking to the Lord our God for his mercy,<br>
just as servants keep their eyes on their master,<br>
as a slave girl watches her mistress for the slightest signal.<br>
3<br>
Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy,<br>
for we have had our fill of contempt.<br>
4<br>
We have had more than our fill of the scoffing of the proud<br>
and the contempt of the arrogant.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
A good servant watches and looks for every opportunity to serve.<br>
Before the king even knows that his glass of water was getting low, the observant servant has already filled it back up again.<br>
Even the king's slightest motion or signal is all that it takes for the servant to know exactly what to do.<br>
A good servant knows what you need and has already brought it to your table before you even have the chance to ask for it.<br>
Help us keep our watch, our eyes and ears, looking for any signal of an opportunity to love God and to love others.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 23:9 (KJV)<br>
(The Lord of hosts hath purposed it, to pollute the pride of all glory,)<br>
9 The Lord of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.<br>
<br>
NLT<br>
9<br>
The Lord of Heaven's Armies has done it<br>
to destroy your pride<br>
and bring low all earth's nobility.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 12:2 (KJV)<br>
<br>
<br>
As I have said before, the chapter breaks and chapter numbers were not originally there, and did not exist until the year 1560.<br>
<br>
Daniel 11 & 12<br>
We will be looking at the following areas of scripture.<br>
Daniel chapter 11, verse 2 and 3, then we skip down to verse 44 and 45, which are the last two verses of chapter 11.<br>
When we hit the end of chapter 11, we will keep on reading into chapter 12, and then we will stop after we read verse 4.<br>
We will do this now in the KJV, and then read these same verses in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.<br>
3 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.<br>
44 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.<br>
<br>
(And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the goodly, holy mountain;)<br>
(And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the mountain of delight of holiness;)<br>
45 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.<br>
1 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.<br>
2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.<br>
<br>
(And they that be teachers shall shine as the brightness of the firmament;)<br>
3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.<br>
4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Selected verses from the book of Daniel, chapters 10, 11 and 12.<br>
Starting at the end of chapter 10, verse 21,<br>
and reading right into chapter 11.<br>
After we read up to chapter 11, verse 3, we will skip down to verse 44, and keep reading right into chapter 12.<br>
Like we did before in the KJV, we will read through chapter 12, stopping again after chapter 12, verse 4.<br>
So, we start in the NLT, in Daniel, chapter 10, verse 21, and we continue reading into chapter 11.<br>
Please note that, in some editions of the NLT, the verse numbers and the chapter break, going from chapter 10 into chapter 11, may be off by one verse.<br>
This is something that happens once in a while in the verse and chapter numbering.<br>
Don't let that distract you from the message and meaning that is being communicated here in the Scriptures.<br>
Daniel, starting in chapter 10, verse 21, NLT...<br>
<br>
21 Meanwhile, I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. (No one helps me against these spirit princes except Michael, your spirit prince.<br>
(No one helps me against these except Michael, your prince.)<br>
(I have been standing beside him,)<br>
1 I have been standing beside Michael to support and strengthen him since the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede.)<br>
2 "Now then, I will reveal the truth to you. Three more Persian kings will reign, to be succeeded by a fourth, far richer than the others. He will use his wealth to stir up everyone to fight against the kingdom of Greece (the kingdom of Javan).<br>
3 "Then a mighty king will rise to power who will rule with great authority and accomplish everything he sets out to do. <br>
44 "But then news from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in great anger to destroy and obliterate many. <br>
45 He will stop between the glorious holy mountain and the sea and will pitch his royal tents. But whilst he is there, his time will suddenly run out, and no one will help him.<br>
1 "At that time, Michael, the archangel (Michael, the great prince,) who stands guard over your nation, will arise. Then there will be a time of anguish greater than any since nations first came into existence. But at that time every one of your people whose name is written in the book will be rescued. <br>
2 Many of those whose bodies lie dead and buried will rise up, some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting disgrace. <br>
3 Those who are wise will shine as bright as the sky, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever. <br>
4 But you, Daniel, keep this prophecy a secret; seal up the book until the time of the end, when many will rush here and there, and knowledge will increase."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 13 & 14<br>
Romans 13, starting in verse 13, and we will continue reading, right into chapter 14, stopping after verse 3. (KJV)<br>
(Let us walk decently, as in the day;)<br>
13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.<br>
14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.<br>
<br>
(Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to judge his doubtful thoughts.)<br>
14:1 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.<br>
2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.<br>
3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.<br>
<br>
Romans 13, starting in verse 13, and we will continue reading, right into chapter 14, stopping after verse 3. NLT:<br>
13 Because we belong to the day, we must live decent lives for all to see. Don't participate in the darkness of wild parties and drunkenness, or in sexual promiscuity and immoral living, or in quarrelling and jealousy. <br>
14 Instead, clothe yourself with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. And don't let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires.<br>
1 Accept other believers who are weak in faith, and don't argue with them about what they think is right or wrong. <br>
2 For instance, one person believes it's all right to eat anything. But another believer with a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables. <br>
3 Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who don't. And those who don't eat certain foods must not condemn those who do, for God has accepted them. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5:11 (KJV)<br>
And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5: 5-14 NLT<br>
5 You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.<br>
6 Don't be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of God will fall on all who disobey him. <br>
7 Don't participate in the things these people do. <br>
8 For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light! <br>
9 For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true.<br>
10 Carefully determine what pleases the Lord. <br>
11 Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them. <br>
12 It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret. <br>
13 But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them, <br>
14 for the light makes everything visible....<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
1 Peter 4: 7 & 8 (KJV)<br>
7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.<br>
8 And above all things have fervent charity amongst yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.<br>
(for charity will cover the multitude of sins.)<br>
<br>
1 Peter 4: 7-10 NLT<br>
7 The end of the world is coming soon. Therefore, be earnest and disciplined in your prayers. <br>
8 Most important of all, continue to show deep love for each other, for love covers a multitude of sins. <br>
9 Cheerfully share your home with those who need a meal or a place to stay.<br>
10 God has given each of you a gift from his great variety of spiritual gifts. Use them well to serve one another.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 5:20 (KJV)<br>
Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.<br>
<br>
James 5: 19 & 20 NLT<br>
19 My dear brothers and sisters, if someone amongst you wanders away from the truth and is brought back, <br>
20 you can be sure that whoever brings the sinner back from wandering will save that person from death and bring about the forgiveness of many sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 18: 15-20 KJV<br>
15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.<br>
16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.<br>
17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.<br>
18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.<br>
19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.<br>
20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 18: 15-22 NLT:<br>
<br>
(If your brother sins against you,)<br>
(If your brother sins,)<br>
(If another believer sins,)<br>
15 "If another believer sins against you, go privately and point out the offense. If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back.<br>
16 But if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others with you and go back again, so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses.<br>
17 If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church. Then if he or she won't accept the church's decision, treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector.<br>
<br>
<br>
(I tell you the truth, whatever you bind, or lock on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you loose or open on earth will be permitted in heaven.)<br>
18 "I tell you the truth, whatever you forbid on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will be permitted in heaven.<br>
19 "I also tell you this: If two of you agree here on earth concerning anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.<br>
(For where two or three gather together in my name, I am there amongst them.)<br>
20 For where two or three gather together as my followers, I am there amongst them."<br>
<br>
(Then Peter came to him and asked, Lord, how often should I forgive my brother who sins against me? Seven times?)<br>
21 Then Peter came to him and asked, "Lord, how often should I forgive someone who sins against me? Seven times?"<br>
22 "No, not seven times," Jesus replied, "but (seventy-seven times, or even) seventy times seven!"<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Ecclesiastes 9: 14-17 (KJV)<br>
14 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:<br>
15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.<br>
16 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.<br>
17 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth amongst fools.<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 9: 14-17<br>
NLT:<br>
14 There was a small town with only a few people, and a great king came with his army and besieged it. <br>
15 A poor, wise man knew how to save the town, and so it was rescued. But afterward no one thought to thank him. <br>
16 So even though wisdom is better than strength, those who are wise will be despised if they are poor. What they say will not be appreciated for long.<br>
17 Better to hear the quiet words of a wise person<br>
than the shouts of a foolish king.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37:16 KJV<br>
16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.<br>
<br>
Psalms 37:16 NLT<br>
16<br>
It is better to be godly and have little<br>
than to be evil and rich.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 15:16 (KJV)<br>
Better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 15:16 & 17 NLT<br>
16<br>
Better to have little, with fear for the Lord,<br>
than to have great treasure and inner turmoil.<br>
17<br>
A bowl of vegetables (or a simple bowl of soup) with someone you love<br>
is better than steak with someone you hate.<br>

<br>
Passover<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's begin by looking at two verses, both found in the book of Deuteronomy.<br>
<br>
In Deuteronomy, chapter 4, Moses Urges Israel, the nation of Israel, to Obey the commandments of the Lord.<br>
<br>
And then, later, near the end of Deuteronomy, chapter 12, going into chapter 13, Moses gives another Warning against Idolatry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4:2 -- KJV<br>
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4:2 -- NLT<br>
Do not add to or subtract from these commands I am giving you. Just obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 12:32 (KJV)<br>
What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 12:32 (NLT)<br>
So be careful to obey all the commands I give you. You must not add anything to them or subtract anything from them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
We should try to observe and remember and do the Passover.<br>
Think about the Passover, and what The Lord is saying to us here, through Moses, here in Deuteronomy 4:2, and again in Deuteronomy 12:32.<br>
Do not add additional requirements to the Passover that are not found in the Bible.<br>
Do not remove, omit or take away from what the Bible says about the Passover, and how it should be done, and do not diminish the value of the Passover story.<br>
The Passover story is also the story about how you are saved and forgiven and are able to celebrate the free gift of eternal life forever in heaven.<br>
It's not about performing and doing every technical detail.  It's about your attitude and your heart about trying your best to do the Passover and the feasts as well as you can, given the resources available to you at that time.<br>
Let's now do a Bible study about the Passover.<br>
We will see here in the Bible that, even when they could not do the Passover with technical perfection,<br>
the Lord still honoured their hearts in them trying their best to do it as well as they can.<br>
The Passover is a very important occasion, a very important story to remember, and a very important feast and meal to think about and observe.<br>
There are many symbols of Jesus and what He did for you and for me, all throughout the Passover festival and feast.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Not very long ago, we did a short Bible Study that touched on the Passover feast.<br>
Let's begin by looking at those verses again.<br>
Then, we will do a prayer about the Passover feast, and then do a more, in-depth study about the Passover.<br>
<br>
<br>
The short study that we recently did was titled, Passover Lamb.<br>
<br>
Here are those verses again.<br>
<br>
Passover Lamb<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 1:29<br>
29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.<br>
<br>
John 1:29 NLT<br>
29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! <br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 5: parts of verses 7 & 8 KJV<br>
7 ...Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:<br>
8 Therefore let us keep the feast....<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 5: verse 7 again, and then reading all of verse 8<br>
7 ...Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:<br>
8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 5: 7 & 8 NLT<br>
(Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed.)<br>
Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us.<br>
8 So let us celebrate the festival, not with the old bread (not with old leaven) of wickedness and evil, but with the new bread (with unleavened bread) of sincerity and truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 12: verses 11 and 14 KJV<br>
...it is the Lord's passover.<br>
14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.<br>
<br>
Exodus 12: verses 11 and 14 NLT<br>
this is the Lord's Passover.<br>
14 "This is a day to remember. Each year, from generation to generation, you must celebrate it as a special festival to the Lord. This is a law for all time. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1: 18-23 KJV<br>
18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;<br>
19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:<br>
20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,<br>
21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.<br>
22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:<br>
23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1: 17-23 NLT<br>
17 And remember that the heavenly Father to whom you pray has no favourites. He will judge or reward you according to what you do. So you must live in reverent fear of him during your time here as "temporary residents."<br>
18 For you know that God paid a ransom to save you from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors. And it was not paid with mere gold or silver, which lose their value.<br>
19 It was the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God. <br>
20 God chose him as your ransom long before the world began, but now in these last days he has been revealed for your sake.<br>
21 Through Christ you have come to trust in God. And you have placed your faith and hope in God because he raised Christ from the dead and gave him great glory.<br>
22 You were cleansed from your sins when you obeyed the truth, so now you (must have brotherly love, and now you) must show sincere love to each other as brothers and sisters. (Love each other deeply with a pure heart.) Love each other deeply with all your heart.<br>
23 For you have been born again, but not to a life that will quickly end. Your new life will last forever because it comes from the eternal, living word of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Let us have right now a moment of prayer.<br>
Our Father in Heaven, our dear, Heavenly Father, almighty, Holy God, Messiah, Lord Jesus Christ, I call upon the name of the Lord to give me wisdom on when and how to do your feasts, especially the Passover feast. Tell us the exact date of when you want us to do the feast, and help us choose and agree upon this date, based on what you tell us.  It should be simple.  We ask, we pray, you answer, you tell, you give us the command, and we do it and obey it, and keep it. Give us clarity, wisdom and unity on this next Passover date.  And, help us not fail to do the steps and details that we are capable of doing, and forgive us for the steps and details that we are unable to do, due to our finances, resources and circumstances at that time. Also, help us not to burden ourselves with additional steps, customs, rituals, traditions and details that are not in the Scriptures, that are not in the Bible, in the Law of Moses, and help us stay away from traditions, customs, rituals, feasts and books that are not clearly in the Bible. You have written your word, the full counsel of the Lord, all the words of God, into our hearts and minds.  This may even include some books that may no longer be in our Holy Bible today.  I'm afraid to find and read these other books because I do not want to let fiction, lies, and inaccuracies creep into me, because I don't want to weaken my relationship with you. If your entire, full counsel of God is written in our hearts and minds right now, help us bring it all into remembrance, and keep, say and do the full word of the Lord, even if there may be some Scriptures that are no longer included in the 66 books of the Holy Bible.  Let us quickly reject any book that is not true, and is not in perfect alignment with your Scriptures, your Torah, your commandments, your perfect and true instructions, your Old and New Testaments, the teachings, preachings and commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the books of the Law of Moses. Pilot us, guide us, and direct us through all things in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen, amen, so be it, let it become true. Hallelujah!<br>
<br>
When should we do the Passover? There is an argument over how to figure out when to do the Passover. Some look at a general calendar that predicts when it should be done.  Some look at a barley harvest, and decide when to do the Passover based on the stage of the barley's ripeness and maturity at a certain time of year. Others look at the moon and stars.  They observe a specific phase of the moon at a certain time in the spring, and count the days from that observation to decide when to do the Passover. Others look at the constellations in the stars of the sky, and when certain groups of stars are at a certain angle or position in the sky, this observation is used to calculate when to do the Passover. There is an argument over which combination of these methods is the right way to determine when to do the Passover.  As a result, some do the Passover a month sooner, and some do this feast a month later.<br>
<br>
Another problem is how exactly to do the Passover.  We may not have all of the money and resources to perfectly do the Passover according to the Law of Moses.  For example, many of us do not have a flock of sheep, or a particular lamb of a certain age that has no blemishes or defects. So, there may be some instructions that we cannot perfectly do, because of our situation of living here in this place, here in these End Times.<br>
<br>
Yet another concern is that some people have tried to add to the words of the Law of Moses, by adding additional details, rituals, traditions, and requirements that are not in the Bible.  When you examine and question the extra details and traditions, some of them have nothing to do with the Lord and the Passover.  There is a Jewish person that wrote a set of instructions on how to do a Seder feast.  This book that he wrote is not in the Bible. This Seder feast is not in the Bible, and contains content that does not point to the Lord.  There is one detail where people eat a sandwich that gives glory and honour to the one who invented the Seder feast, instead of giving glory and honour to the Lord.  There is another detail where people eat eggs in a Seder feast.  The Lord did not tell the Hebrew children to go into the hen house and get eggs for the Passover.  The eggs could more likely be referencing a Babylonian fertility goddess, which is why there is a holiday called, Easter, that includes Easter eggs and the Easter bunny. Easter is Babylonian, and is not Christian, and this Easter content is not in the Bible.<br>
<br>
People may be burdening themselves with extra Passover requirements that are not in the Bible.  People say that they have added all of these extra rituals to help them remember things in the Bible.  I have a better idea.  Instead of doing all these unnecessary rituals and requirements, why don't you take the time each day to actually read your Bible?  That's an even better way to remember what is in the Bible, by actually reading and studying the Scriptures, every day, all throughout each year! You can't bring all of these things into remembrance, if you don't first put them into your rememberer. Read the entire Bible, each day, all of the Old and New Testaments, every day, even if you are only reading a page a day. Again, I say, read your Bible and pray, every single day.<br>
<br>
Watch out for those that say that some parts of the Bible are of no value.  Those people are setting themselves up for a big fall.  Some people only stay in the Old Testament and avoid the New Testament.  Others only read the New Testament, and refuse to read the Old Testament. It may be wise to stay away from foolish people like that, and the so-called churches that they are going to, but don't stop praying for them, and do not stop praying for the other people that are also attending their church.  They need the Lord Jesus, the Way, the Truth and the Eternal Life. We all do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look at some selected sections of Scripture.<br>
We will read the KJV now, and then come back to this later in the NLT<br>
We will turn to the book of 2 Chronicles.<br>
We will be skipping through some parts of Chapters 33, 34 and 35.<br>
For the KJV, we will start in chapter 34, verses 1, 2, 3, and then read verse 8.<br>
Then Verse 14 through 21, and verses 26 through 33.<br>
Then we will go right into chapter 34, reading just the verses 1, 6 and 7.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 34 & 35 KJV<br>
chapter 34, starting in verse 1<br>
1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.<br>
2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.<br>
3 For in the eighth year of his reign, whilst he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.<br>
<br>
8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God.<br>
<br>
14 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses.<br>
(Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by the hand of Moses.)<br>
15 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.<br>
<br>
<br>
16 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.<br>
(All that was committed to the hand of thy servants, they do it.)<br>
<br>
(And they have poured out the money, and they have melted the money that was found in the house of the Lord,)<br>
17 And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.<br>
<br>
<br>
18 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.<br>
(And Shaphan read in it before the king.)<br>
19 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.<br>
<br>
<br>
20 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah (also known as Achbor the son of Micah), and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,<br>
21 Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord, to do after all that is written in this book.<br>
<br>
<br>
26 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the Lord, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;<br>
27 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the Lord.<br>
28 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.<br>
29 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
30 And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, (from great even to small, all the people,) great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the Lord.<br>
31 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.<br>
<br>
<br>
(And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin,)<br>
32 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
33 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the Lord their God. And all his days they departed not from following the Lord, the God of their fathers.<br>
(And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve the Lord their God. And all his days they departed not from after following the Lord, the God of their fathers.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the Lord in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.<br>
6 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.<br>
<br>
<br>
(And Josiah offered to the people,)<br>
7 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.<br>
<br>
That was 2 Chronicles, chapter 34, where we just read verse 1, verse 6, and that last verse we just read was verse 7. KJV.<br>
Next, we skip down to 2 Chronicles, chapter 35, verses 11 through 14, then verses 16 through 19.<br>
2 Chronicles, chapter 35, starting in verse 11...<br>
11 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.<br>
12 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.<br>
<br>
13 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, (and made them run speedily amongst all the people,) and divided them speedily amongst all the people.<br>
14 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.<br>
<br>
<br>
16 So all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king Josiah.<br>
(And the children of Israel that were found,)<br>
17 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.<br>
18 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, (and all Judah and Israel that were found) and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<br>
19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, those were some various selections from the book, 2 Chronicles, in chapters 33, 34 & 35. KJV.<br>
We will look at these same selected verses again in the NLT, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
But, before we do, let's let's go back a few pages, and look at 2 Chronicles 30, in the KJV.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 30<br>
all of chapter 30<br>
KJV<br>
1 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel.<br>
2 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.<br>
3 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
(And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and all the congregation.)<br>
4 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.<br>
5 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.<br>
<br>
(So the posts went with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes,)<br>
6 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.<br>
7 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.<br>
<br>
(Now harden not your necks, as your fathers were, but give the hand yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.)<br>
8 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.<br>
9 For if ye turn again unto the Lord, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.<br>
10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.<br>
11 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.<br>
12 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the Lord.<br>
13 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.<br>
14 And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.<br>
15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
(And they stood in their standing after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God,)<br>
16 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.<br>
17 For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the Lord.<br>
18 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good Lord pardon every one<br>
19 That prepareth his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.<br>
20 And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.<br>
<br>
(And the children of Israel that were found at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, singing with instruments of strength unto the Lord.)<br>
21 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the Lord.<br>
<br>
(And Hezekiah spake to the heart of all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the Lord,)<br>
22 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the Lord: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the Lord God of their fathers.<br>
23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.<br>
<br>
<br>
(For Hezekiah king of Judah lifted up to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes lifted up to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.)<br>
(For Hezekiah king of Judah offered to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes offered to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.)<br>
24 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.<br>
25 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.<br>
26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
27 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.<br>
(And their prayer came up to the habitation of his holiness.)<br>
<br>
We are looking at this chapter, chapter 30, because it talks about how they went about doing the Celebration of Passover.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 30<br>
all of chapter 30<br>
NLT<br>
<br>
1 King Hezekiah now sent word to all Israel and Judah, and he wrote letters of invitation to the people of Ephraim and Manasseh. He asked everyone to come to the Temple of the Lord at Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord, the God of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 The king, his officials, and all the community of Jerusalem decided to celebrate Passover a month later than usual.<br>
<br>
(They decided to celebrate Passover in the second month. Passover was normally observed in the first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar.)<br>
<br>
3 They were unable to celebrate it at the prescribed time because not enough priests could be purified by then, and the people had not yet assembled at Jerusalem.<br>
4 This plan for keeping the Passover seemed right to the king and all the people.<br>
5 So they sent a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north, inviting everyone to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord, the God of Israel. The people had not been celebrating it in great numbers as required in the Law.<br>
6 At the king's command, runners were sent throughout Israel and Judah. They carried letters that said:<br>
<br>
<br>
"O people of Israel, return to the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that he will return to the few of us who have survived the conquest of the Assyrian kings.<br>
<br>
(Israel is the name that God gave to Jacob.)<br>
<br>
7 Do not be like your ancestors and relatives who abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and became an object of derision, as you yourselves can see.<br>
8 Do not be stubborn, as they were, but submit yourselves to the Lord. Come to his Temple, which he has set apart as holy forever. Worship the Lord your God so that his fierce anger will turn away from you.<br>
9 "For if you return to the Lord, your relatives and your children will be treated mercifully by their captors, and they will be able to return to this land. For the Lord your God is gracious and merciful. If you return to him, he will not continue to turn his face from you."<br>
<br>
10 The runners went from town to town throughout Ephraim and Manasseh and as far as the territory of Zebulun. But most of the people just laughed at the runners and made fun of them.<br>
11 However, some people from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.<br>
12 At the same time, God's hand was on the people in the land of Judah, giving them all one heart to obey the orders of the king and his officials, who were following the word of the Lord.<br>
<br>
(So a huge crowd assembled at Jerusalem in the second month. The second month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of April and May.)<br>
<br>
13 So a huge crowd assembled at Jerusalem in midspring to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread.<br>
14 They set to work and removed the pagan altars from Jerusalem. They took away all the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.<br>
<br>
(The people slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month, one month later than usual. Passover normally began on the fourteenth day of the first month, as indicated in Lev 23:5).<br>
<br>
<br>
15 On the fourteenth day of the second month, one month later than usual, the people slaughtered the Passover lamb. This shamed the priests and Levites, so they purified themselves and brought burnt offerings to the Temple of the Lord.<br>
<br>
16 Then they took their places at the Temple as prescribed in the Law of Moses, the man of God. The Levites brought the sacrificial blood to the priests, who then sprinkled it on the altar.<br>
17 Since many of the people had not purified themselves, the Levites had to slaughter their Passover lamb for them, to set them apart for the Lord. <br>
18 Most of those who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not purified themselves. But King Hezekiah prayed for them, and they were allowed to eat the Passover meal anyway, even though this was contrary to the requirements of the Law. For Hezekiah said, "May the Lord, who is good, pardon those<br>
19 who decide to follow the Lord, the God of their ancestors, even though they are not properly cleansed for the ceremony."<br>
20 And the Lord listened to Hezekiah's prayer and healed the people.<br>
<br>
21 So the people of Israel who were present in Jerusalem joyously celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. Each day the Levites and priests sang to the Lord (with all their strength), accompanied by loud instruments.<br>
22 Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites regarding the skill they displayed as they served the Lord. The celebration continued for seven days. Peace offerings were sacrificed, and the people gave thanks to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.<br>
23 The entire assembly then decided to continue the festival another seven days, so they celebrated joyfully for another week.<br>
24 King Hezekiah gave the people 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep and goats for offerings, and the officials donated 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep and goats. Meanwhile, many more priests purified themselves.<br>
25 The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, including the priests, the Levites, all who came from the land of Israel, the foreigners who came to the festival, and all those who lived in Judah.<br>
26 There was great joy in the city, for Jerusalem had not seen a celebration like this one since the days of Solomon, King David's son.<br>
27 Then the priests and Levites stood and blessed the people, and God heard their prayer from his holy dwelling in heaven.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Earlier, we read in the KJV, some selections from the book of, 2 Chronicles, in chapters 33, 34 & 35<br>
Let's look at those selected areas of Scripture again, but this time, in the NLT.<br>
We will turn to the NLT, again reading in the book of 2 Chronicles.<br>
We will be skipping through some parts of Chapters 33, 34 and 35.<br>
NLT<br>
2 Chronicles 33, 34 & 35<br>
We start in chapter 33, verses 21 through 25, and we keep reading into chapter 34,<br>
Verses 1 through 3, and then verse 8, then, whilst still in chapter 34, we will skip down to verses 14 through 21, and then read verses 26 through 33,<br>
and then we will continue reading into chapter 35, verses, 1, and 2.<br>
<br>
21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years.<br>
22 He did what was evil in the Lord's sight, just as his father, Manasseh, had done. He worshiped and sacrificed to all the idols his father had made.<br>
23 But unlike his father, he did not humble himself before the Lord. Instead, Amon sinned even more.<br>
24 Then Amon's own officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.<br>
25 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah the next king.<br>
<br>
1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years.<br>
2 He did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight and followed the example of his ancestor David. He did not turn away from doing what was right.<br>
3 During the eighth year of his reign, whilst he was still young, Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David. Then in the twelfth year he began to purify Judah and Jerusalem, destroying all the pagan shrines, the Asherah poles, and the carved idols and cast images.<br>
<br>
Again, we are in 2 Chronicles, chapter 34. NLT.<br>
We will continue with verse 8, then we will skip down to verses 14 through 21,<br>
then verse 26 through verse 33,  which is the end of chapter 34, and once we hit the end of chapter 34,<br>
we will keep on reading, right into 2 Chronicles, chapter 35, verse 1 and 2, then we will jump from verse 2, over to verses 6 through 8.<br>
We now continue with verse 8, then we will skip down to verse 14.<br>
<br>
<br>
8 In the eighteenth year of his reign, after he had purified the land and the Temple, Josiah appointed Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of Jerusalem, and Joah son of Joahaz, the royal historian, to repair the Temple of the Lord his God.<br>
<br>
14 Whilst they were bringing out the money collected at the Lord's Temple, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord that was written by Moses.<br>
15 Hilkiah said to Shaphan the court secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the Lord's Temple!" Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan.<br>
16 Shaphan took the scroll to the king and reported, "Your officials are doing everything they were assigned to do.<br>
17 The money that was collected at the Temple of the Lord has been turned over to the supervisors and workmen."<br>
18 Shaphan also told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll." So Shaphan read it to the king.<br>
19 When the king heard what was written in the Law, he tore his clothes in despair.<br>
<br>
<br>
20 Then he gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, (who is also known as Abdon son of Micah,) Shaphan the court secretary, and Asaiah the king's personal adviser:<br>
21 "Go to the Temple and speak to the Lord for me and for all the remnant of Israel and Judah. Inquire about the words written in the scroll that has been found. For the Lord's great anger has been poured out on us because our ancestors have not obeyed the word of the Lord. We have not been doing everything this scroll says we must do."<br>
<br>
26 "But go to the king of Judah who sent you to seek the Lord and tell him: 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning the message you have just heard:<br>
27 You were sorry and humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this city and its people. You humbled yourself and tore your clothing in despair and wept before me in repentance. And I have indeed heard you, says the Lord.<br>
28 So I will not send the promised disaster until after you have died and been buried in peace. You yourself will not see the disaster I am going to bring on this city and its people.'"<br>
So they took her message back to the king.<br>
29 Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. <br>
30 And the king went up to the Temple of the Lord with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, along with the priests and the Levites -- all the people from the greatest to the least. There the king read to them the entire Book of the Covenant that had been found in the Lord's Temple.<br>
31 The king took his place of authority beside the pillar and renewed the covenant in the Lord's presence. He pledged to obey the Lord by keeping all his commands, laws, and decrees with all his heart and soul. He promised to obey all the terms of the covenant that were written in the scroll.<br>
32 And he required everyone in Jerusalem and the people of Benjamin to make a similar pledge. The people of Jerusalem did so, renewing their covenant with God, the God of their ancestors.<br>
33 So Josiah removed all detestable idols from the entire land of Israel and required everyone to worship the Lord their God. And throughout the rest of his lifetime, they did not turn away from the Lord, the God of their ancestors.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Then Josiah announced that the Passover of the Lord would be celebrated in Jerusalem, and so the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month.<br>
(This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar was 5 April 622 BC)<br>
2 Josiah also assigned the priests to their duties and encouraged them in their work at the Temple of the Lord.<br>
<br>
6 Slaughter the Passover lambs, purify yourselves, and prepare to help those who come. Follow all the directions that the Lord gave through Moses."<br>
7 Then Josiah provided 30,000 lambs and young goats for the people's Passover offerings, along with 3,000 cattle, all from the king's own flocks and herds.<br>
8 The king's officials also made willing contributions to the people, priests, and Levites.<br>
<br>
We are in 2 Chronicles, chapter 35. That was verses 6, 7 and 8. NLT.<br>
We have just two last areas to look at, here in chapter 35.<br>
We will now skip down, in chapter 35, to verses 11 through 14, and then read verses 16 through 19.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11 The Levites then slaughtered the Passover lambs and presented the blood to the priests, who sprinkled the blood on the altar whilst the Levites prepared the animals.<br>
12 They divided the burnt offerings amongst the people by their family groups, so they could offer them to the Lord as prescribed in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.<br>
13 Then they roasted the Passover lambs as prescribed; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, kettles, and pans, and brought them out quickly so the people could eat them.<br>
14 Afterward the Levites prepared Passover offerings for themselves and for the priests -- the descendants of Aaron -- because the priests had been busy from morning till night offering the burnt offerings and the fat portions. The Levites took responsibility for all these preparations.<br>
<br>
16 The entire ceremony for the Lord's Passover was completed that day. All the burnt offerings were sacrificed on the altar of the Lord, as King Josiah had commanded.<br>
17 All the Israelites present in Jerusalem celebrated Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.<br>
18 Never since the time of the prophet Samuel had there been such a Passover. None of the kings of Israel had ever kept a Passover as Josiah did, involving all the priests and Levites, all the people of Jerusalem, and people from all over Judah and Israel.<br>
19 This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.<br>
<br>
This story about Josiah, we found in 2 Chronicles 33, 34 & 35.<br>
<br>
The same story about Josiah is also told in the book of 2 Kings, chapters 21, 22 and 23.<br>
To save us some time, we will also just look at some selected areas within these chapters.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 21: 19-24 KJV<br>
19 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.<br>
20 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasseh did.<br>
21 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:<br>
22 And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord.<br>
23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.<br>
24 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 22<br>
1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.<br>
2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.<br>
<br>
8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, (Thy servants have melted the money that was found in the house,) Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the Lord.<br>
10 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.<br>
11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.<br>
<br>
<br>
12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, (also known as Abdon the son of Micah,) and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,<br>
13 Go ye, enquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.<br>
<br>
18 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the Lord, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;<br>
19 Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the Lord.<br>
20 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.<br>
<br>
2 Kings 23<br>
1 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.<br>
2 And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, (from small even unto great,) both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the Lord.<br>
3 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.<br>
<br>
21 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.<br>
22 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;<br>
23 But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the Lord in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
24 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the (teraphim) images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord.<br>
<br>
That was 2 Kings 23, verse 24. In that last verse we just read, it mentioned teraphim images. What is teraphim?<br>
Teraphim was a family idol, a kind of idol used in household worship or a household shrine.<br>
Commentary: This could mean that a family unit, or trying to have the image of a family unit, could be, in some cases, a form of idolatry.<br>
Some unnatural or illegitimate couples may try to create or transmit an image of a family unit, which could be spiritually rooted in this teraphim idolatry.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
2 Kings 21: verses 19 through 24<br>
19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah.<br>
20 He did what was evil in the Lord's sight, just as his father, Manasseh, had done.<br>
21 He followed the example of his father, worshiping the same idols his father had worshiped.<br>
22 He abandoned the Lord, the God of his ancestors, and he refused to follow the Lord's ways.<br>
23 Then Amon's own officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.<br>
24 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah the next king.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 22, verses 1 and 2, and then we will skip down to verse 8.<br>
1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath.<br>
2 He did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight and followed the example of his ancestor David. He did not turn away from doing what was right.<br>
<br>
8 Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the court secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the Lord's Temple!" Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan, and he read it.<br>
9 Shaphan went to the king and reported, "Your officials have turned over the money collected at the Temple of the Lord to the workers and supervisors at the Temple."<br>
10 Shaphan also told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll." So Shaphan read it to the king.<br>
11 When the king heard what was written in the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes in despair.<br>
12 Then he gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the court secretary, and Asaiah the king's personal adviser:<br>
13 "Go to the Temple and speak to the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah. Inquire about the words written in this scroll that has been found. For the Lord's great anger is burning against us because our ancestors have not obeyed the words in this scroll. We have not been doing everything it says we must do."<br>
<br>
18 "But go to the king of Judah who sent you to seek the Lord and tell him: 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning the message you have just heard:<br>
19 You were sorry and humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I said against this city and its people -- that this land would be cursed and become desolate. You tore your clothing in despair and wept before me in repentance. And I have indeed heard you, says the Lord.<br>
20 So I will not send the promised disaster until after you have died and been buried in peace. You will not see the disaster I am going to bring on this city.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
2 Kings 23<br>
1 Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.<br>
2 And the king went up to the Temple of the Lord with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, along with the priests and the prophets -- all the people from the least to the greatest. There the king read to them the entire Book of the Covenant that had been found in the Lord's Temple.<br>
3 The king took his place of authority beside the pillar and renewed the covenant in the Lord's presence. He pledged to obey the Lord by keeping all his commands, laws, and decrees with all his heart and soul. In this way, he confirmed all the terms of the covenant that were written in the scroll, and all the people pledged themselves to the covenant.<br>
<br>
15 The king also tore down the altar at Bethel -- the pagan shrine that Jeroboam son of Nebat had made when he caused Israel to sin. He burned down the shrine and ground it to dust, and he burned the Asherah pole.<br>
16 Then Josiah turned around and noticed several tombs in the side of the hill. He ordered that the bones be brought out, and he burned them on the altar at Bethel to desecrate it. (This happened just as the Lord had promised through the man of God when Jeroboam stood beside the altar at the festival.)<br>
Then Josiah turned and looked up at the tomb of the man of God who had predicted these things.<br>
<br>
17 "What is that monument over there?" Josiah asked.<br>
And the people of the town told him, "It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted the very things that you have just done to the altar at Bethel!"<br>
18 Josiah replied, "Leave it alone. Don't disturb his bones." So they did not burn his bones or those of the old prophet from Samaria.<br>
19 Then Josiah demolished all the buildings at the pagan shrines in the towns of Samaria, just as he had done at Bethel. They had been built by the various kings of Israel and had made the Lord very angry.<br>
20 He executed the priests of the pagan shrines on their own altars, and he burned human bones on the altars to desecrate them. Finally, he returned to Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
21 King Josiah then issued this order to all the people: "You must celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, as required in this Book of the Covenant."<br>
22 There had not been a Passover celebration like that since the time when the judges ruled in Israel, nor throughout all the years of the kings of Israel and Judah.<br>
23 But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign, this Passover was celebrated to the Lord in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
In the next verse, verse 24, where we read, the idols, The Hebrew term right there (which literally means, round things) probably alludes to dung.<br>
<br>
24 Josiah also got rid of the mediums and psychics, the household gods, the idols, and every other kind of detestable practice, both in Jerusalem and throughout the land of Judah. He did this in obedience to the laws written in the scroll that Hilkiah the priest had found in the Lord's Temple.<br>
25 Never before had there been a king like Josiah, who turned to the Lord with all his heart and soul and strength, obeying all the laws of Moses. And there has never been a king like him since.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the story where Jesus Feeds Five Thousand.<br>
<br>
We will start with the KJV of John 6: verses 4 through 14, and then we will skip down to verse 22,<br>
and read from verse 22 through 29.<br>
<br>
4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.<br>
5 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?<br>
6 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.<br>
7 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.<br>
8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,<br>
9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they amongst so many?<br>
10 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.<br>
11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.<br>
12 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.<br>
13 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.<br>
14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
22 The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;<br>
23 (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)<br>
24 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.<br>
25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?<br>
26 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.<br>
27 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.<br>
28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?<br>
29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the NLT of John 6: verses 4 through 15, and then we will skip down to verse 22,<br>
and read from verse 22 through 29.<br>
NLT
<br>
4 (It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover celebration.) <br>
5 Jesus soon saw a huge crowd of people coming to look for him. Turning to Philip, he asked, "Where can we buy bread to feed all these people?"<br>
6 He was testing Philip, for he already knew what he was going to do.<br>
<br>
(Philip replied, "Two hundred denarii would not be enough to feed them!")<br>
(A denarius was equivalent to a labourer's full day's wage.)<br>
7 Philip replied, "Even if we worked for months, we wouldn't have enough money to feed them!"<br>
<br>
8 Then Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up.<br>
9 "There's a young boy here with five barley loaves and two fish. But what good is that with this huge crowd?"<br>
10 "Tell everyone to sit down," Jesus said. So they all sat down on the grassy slopes. (The men alone numbered about 5,000.)<br>
11 Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks to God, and distributed them to the people. Afterward he did the same with the fish. And they all ate as much as they wanted.<br>
12 After everyone was full, Jesus told his disciples, "Now gather the leftovers, so that nothing is wasted."<br>
13 So they picked up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with scraps left by the people who had eaten from the five barley loaves.<br>
 <br>
14 When the people saw him (Jesus,) do this miraculous sign, they exclaimed, "Surely, he is the Prophet we have been expecting!"<br>
<br>
(They are referring to Deuteronomy, chapter 18: verses 15 and 18, and the book of Malachi, chapter 4, verses 5 and 6.)<br>
<br>
15 When Jesus saw that they were ready to force him to be their king, he slipped away into the hills by himself.<br>
<br>
22 The next day the crowd that had stayed on the far shore saw that the disciples had taken the only boat, and they realised Jesus had not gone with them.<br>
23 Several boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the Lord had blessed the bread and the people had eaten.<br>
24 So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went across to Capernaum to look for him.<br>
25 They found him on the other side of the lake and asked, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"<br>
26 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, you want to be with me because I fed you, not because you understood the miraculous signs.<br>
<br>
27 But don't be so concerned about perishable things like food. Spend your energy seeking the eternal life that the Son of Man can give you. For God the Father has given me the seal of his approval."<br>
<br>
(The "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.)<br>
<br>
28 They replied, "We want to perform God's works, too. What should we do?"<br>
29 Jesus told them, "This is the only work God wants from you: Believe in the one he has sent."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
There were those that were there, not because of the teachings of Jesus, not because of the healings and miracles that happend right before their eyes.<br>
There were only there for the free food after the church service.<br>
Seriously believing followers of Christ are like the valuable wheat in a farmer's field.<br>
The selfish people are like the weeds in a farmer's wheat field.<br>
They just happen to be in the right place at the right time, taking advantage of the good, nutritious, fertilised soil, and the water that the farmer delivers to the field.<br>
Because they are selfish, they do not produce the fruit of the spirit that is of any value to the farmer.<br>
They just want the free water and fertilised soil and they don't care of producing anything that would be of value to the farmer.<br>
<br>
Matthew 13: 24-30 KJV<br>
24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:<br>
25 But whilst men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares amongst the wheat, and went his way.<br>
26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.<br>
27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?<br>
28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?<br>
29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.<br>
30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 13: 24-30 NLT<br>
24 Here is another story Jesus told: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field.<br>
25 But that night as the workers slept, his enemy came and planted weeds amongst the wheat, then slipped away.<br>
26 When the crop began to grow and produce grain, the weeds also grew.<br>
27 "The farmer's workers went to him and said, 'Sir, the field where you planted that good seed is full of weeds! Where did they come from?'<br>
28
"'An enemy has done this!' the farmer exclaimed.<br>
"'Should we pull out the weeds?' they asked.<br>
29
"'No,' he replied, 'you'll uproot the wheat if you do.<br>
30 Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to sort out the weeds, tie them into bundles, and burn them, and to put the wheat in the barn.'"<br>

<br>
Here are some selected verses from Leviticus 23.<br>
Leviticus 23 gives us a look at all of the seven feasts that the Lord commands us to do.<br>
We will mention the verse numbers that pertain to a particular feast, so if you want to read the instructions about that feast, you could read those verses yourself here in this chapter.<br>
There may also be some additional instructions for the feasts added to the end of this chapter.<br>
So, if you want the complete set of instructions for all of these feasts, you should read this entire chapter.<br>
For today, we are just going to make a list of the seven feasts by looking at some selected verses here in this chapter of<br>
Leviticus 23.<br>
To try to keep this list short and clear, we will only be reading our selected verses out of this chapter today in the NLT.<br>
The chapter starts by reminding us to make every Saturday a Sabbath day, in which we do not work, and we do not buy or sell on any Sabbath day of rest.
<br>
Leviticus 23, verses 2, 3 and 4.<br>
NLT<br>
2 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. These are the Lord's appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim as official days for holy assembly.<br>
3 "You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of complete rest, an official day for holy assembly. It is the Lord's Sabbath day, and it must be observed wherever you live.<br>
4 "In addition to the Sabbath, these are the Lord's appointed festivals, the official days for holy assembly that are to be celebrated at their proper times each year.<br>
<br>
Here is the list of the feasts, in Leviticus 23<br>
Feast 1 of 7.<br>
Passover<br>
Leviticus 23, verse 5<br>
This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May.<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast 2 of 7.<br>
The Festival of Unleavened Bread<br>
Leviticus 23, verse 6-8<br>
The Festival of Unleavened Bread are seven days that start at the Passover meal.<br>
This festival to the Lord continues for seven days, and during that time the bread you eat must be made without yeast.<br>
Passover is a meal, and Feast 2 of 7, Unleavened bread, are seven days that start at the Passover meal.<br>
Feast 1 and Feast 2 always start on the same day at sunset. Since Feast 2 is a sabbath, the next day is a sabbath.<br>
Feast 1 is the meal at sunset, and Feast 2 Day 1 is a sabbath day that starts at the same time as Feast 1, and carries on into the next day until sunset.<br>
Feast 2 Day 1 is a sabbath. Days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are not sabbath days of rest.<br>
Feast 2 Day 7 is a sabbath.<br>
<br>
It is also possible for Feast 3 to sometimes land during the seven day period inside of Feast 2.<br>
That would mean that one might sometimes do Feast 3 before being done with Feast 2.<br>
<br>
More details about this are found in the study, Seven Feasts, in Christian Essays 15 and in the study, Seven Feast Dates and Calculations, in Christian Essays 22.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast 3 of 7.<br>
Celebration of First Harvest<br>
Leviticus 23, verse 9-14<br>
For now, let's just read the NLT of verses 10 and 11.
Leviticus 23, verse 10 & 11:<br>
bring the priest a bundle of grain from the first cutting of your grain harvest. <br>
11<br>
On the day after the Sabbath, the priest will lift it up before the Lord so it may be accepted on your behalf.<br>
This section of verse 9-14 also gives the details pertaining to the following:<br>
On that same day you must sacrifice a one-year-old male lamb with no defects.<br>
With it you must present an offering of grain and wine<br>
See this area of scripture for more details.<br>
Again, the Celebration of First Harvest is in verses 9-14.<br>
This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation wherever you live.<br>
<br>
Feast 4 of 7.<br>
The Festival of Harvest<br>
Leviticus 23, verse 15-22<br>
We will read now just verses 15 and 16 in the NLT.<br>
15 "From the day after the Sabbath -- the day you bring the bundle of grain to be lifted up as a special offering -- count off seven full weeks.<br>
16 Keep counting until the day after the seventh Sabbath, fifty days later. Then present an offering of new grain to the Lord.<br>
Various offerings are provided at this time.<br>
The details of these offerings are in this section of Scripture, which is in Leviticus 23:15-22.<br>
In the New Testament, we also see this Feast 4 of 7, The Festival of Harvest, or Festival of Weeks, being called the Festival of Pentecost (in the book of Acts 2:1).<br>
The Festival of Pentecost came 50 days after Passover (when Jesus was crucified).<br>
On the day of Pentecost, all the believers were meeting together in one place.<br>
<br>
Acts 2: 1-4 NLT<br>
1 On the day of Pentecost<br>
2 Suddenly, there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm, and it filled the house where they were sitting.<br>
3 Then, what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them.<br>
4 And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other languages (in other tongues) as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast 5 of 7.<br>
The Festival of Trumpets<br>
Leviticus 23, verse 23-25<br>
On the first day of the seventh month.<br>
This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in September or October. This festival is celebrated today as Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year.<br>
The Jewish new year, which is in the autumn, is not the same thing as the new year as defined in the Bible.<br>
The Bible's definition of a new year is 13 days before Passover, which is in March or April.<br>
After the Spring Equinox, which is the first day of spring, the first visible sliver of light on the moon, after the new moon, is the official start of the new year, according to the Bible and the Book of Enoch.<br>
This feast, The Festival of Trumpets, is on the first day of the seventh month,<br>
and on this day you are to observe a day of complete rest. It will be an official day for holy assembly, a day commemorated with loud blasts of a trumpet.<br>
25 "You must do no ordinary work on that day. Instead, you are to present special gifts to the Lord."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Again, after the Spring Equinox, which is the first day of spring, the first visible sliver of light on the moon, after the new moon, is the official start of the new year, according to the Bible and the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
From this new moon first-sliver-of-light calculation, we can determine when the new year starts, when to do a new moon festival each month, when each month starts and ends, and when to do each of the seven feasts.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, there can be a few different, other common, popular or otherwise traditional methods for making these calculations which may not be based on the Bible, and the instructions found in the books that used to be in the Bible. As a result, in a fellowship of believers, there can be an argument for and against these various date calculation methods.  This may cause some to decide celebrating the new moon festivals and the seven feast dates one day sooner, one day later, or one week sooner or one week later, or even one month sooner or one month later.<br>
<br>
This is why we need to remember once again this important passage...<br>
<br>
Colossians 2: 16 & 17 (KJV)<br>
16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:<br>
17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 2: 16 & 17 (NLT)<br>
16 So don't let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths.<br>
17 For these rules are only shadows of the reality yet to come. And Christ himself is that reality.<br>
<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, let's go on to the next one, which is Feast 6 of 7...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast 6 of 7.<br>
The Day of Atonement<br>
Leviticus 23, verse 26-32<br>
celebrate the Day of Atonement on the tenth day of that same month -- nine days after the Festival of Trumpets.<br>
On the tenth day of the seventh month; This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in September or October.<br>
It is celebrated today as Yom Kippur.<br>
You must observe it as an official day for holy assembly, a day to deny yourselves (traditionally thought of as a day to fast) and present special gifts to the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast 7 of 7.<br>
The Festival of Shelters<br>
Leviticus 23, verses 33-36<br>
The Festival of Shelters is also known as, Festival of Booths, or Festival of Tabernacles.<br>
This was earlier called the Festival of the Final Harvest or Festival of Ingathering.<br>
<br>
Feast 4 of 7, and Feast 7 of 7 are also talked about here in<br>
Exodus 23:16 NLT:<br>
celebrate the Festival of Harvest, or Festival of Weeks. This was later called the Festival of Pentecost (Acts 2:1). It is celebrated today as Shavuot (or Shabuoth). when you bring me the first crops of your harvest.<br>
"Finally, celebrate the Festival of the Final Harvest, or Festival of Ingathering. This was later called the Festival of Shelters or Festival of Tabernacles (Lev 23:33-36). It is celebrated today as Sukkot (or Succoth) at the end of the harvest season, when you have harvested all the crops from your fields.<br>
<br>
Again, it is celebrated today as Sukkot (or Succoth). on the fifteenth day of the appointed month -- five days after the Day of Atonement.<br>
On the fifteenth day of the seventh month. This festival to the Lord will last for seven days.<br>
this seven-day festival to the Lord -- the Festival of Shelters -- begins on the fifteenth day of the appointed month,<br>
(on the fifteenth day of the seventh month)<br>
after you have harvested all the produce of the land. The first day and the eighth day of the festival will be days of complete rest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23: verses 33-36 -- KJV<br>
23:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
23:34 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.<br>
23:35 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.<br>
23:36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD:<br>
(it is a day of restraint;)<br>
it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Festival of Shelters is also known as the Festival of Booths, or the Festival of Tabernacles.<br>
This was earlier called the Festival of the Final Harvest, the Feast of Ingathering, or the Festival of Ingathering, as indicated in Exodus 23:16.<br>
It is celebrated today as Sukkot (or Succoth) on the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar.<br>
<br>
Exodus 23:16 (KJV)<br>
(Thou shalt keep)...the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23: verses 33-36 -- NLT<br>
33 And the Lord said to Moses,<br>
34 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. Begin celebrating the Festival of Shelters on the fifteenth day of the appointed month -- five days after the Day of Atonement. This festival to the Lord will last for seven days.<br>
35 On the first day of the festival you must proclaim an official day for holy assembly, when you do no ordinary work.<br>
36 For seven days you must present special gifts to the Lord. The eighth day is another holy day on which you present your special gifts to the Lord. This will be a solemn occasion, and no ordinary work may be done that day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, that was a quick look at all seven of the Lord's feasts.<br>
We will talk about them again another day, when we get to The Bible's Greatest Hits, chapters 15 and 22.<br>
For now, this Bible Study is mainly focusing on the Passover Feast.<br>
We are looking at all of the places in the Bible that talk about what they actually did at the Passover feasts and how they did it.<br>
There are some additional places that happen to mention the Passover as a reference to that time of the year when something else happened,<br>
but we will not look at those verses, since they are not actually talking about the Passover feast itself.<br>
<br>
We will now continue looking at some additional places that tell us about the Passover.<br>
There were a few special circumstances that happened during the Passover feasts.<br>
Let's take a look at what they were, and what they did for those particular circumstances.<br>
Coming up here soon, we will also be looking at the first, original and full set of instructions that they were given when they did the very first Passover, which we will be looking at here later on, in Exodus 12.<br>
<br>
For now, let's look at a special situation that happened in Numbers 9.<br>
This was The Second Passover, the second time that they did the Passover feast.<br>
Numbers 9: 1-14 KJV<br>
1 And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,<br>
2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.<br>
3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, (between the two evenings,) ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.<br>
4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.<br>
5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.<br>
6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:<br>
7 And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in his appointed season amongst the children of Israel?<br>
8 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you.<br>
9 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
10 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the Lord.<br>
11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.<br>
12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.<br>
13 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from amongst his people: because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.<br>
14 And if a stranger shall sojourn amongst you, and will keep the passover unto the Lord; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.<br>
<br>
Numbers 9: 1-14 NLT:<br>
<br>
(The first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of March and April.)<br>
(the fourteenth day of the first month, in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar, occurred in late March, April, or early May.)<br>
<br>
1 A year after Israel's departure from Egypt, the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai. In the first month of that year he said,<br>
2 "Tell the Israelites to celebrate the Passover at the prescribed time,<br>
3 at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. Be sure to follow all my decrees and regulations concerning this celebration."<br>
4 So Moses told the people to celebrate the Passover<br>
5 in the wilderness of Sinai as twilight fell on the fourteenth day of the month. And they celebrated the festival there, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.<br>
6 But some of the men had been ceremonially defiled by touching a dead body, so they could not celebrate the Passover that day. They came to Moses and Aaron that day<br>
7 and said, "We have become ceremonially unclean by touching a dead body. But why should we be prevented from presenting the Lord's offering at the proper time with the rest of the Israelites?"<br>
8 Moses answered, "Wait here until I have received instructions for you from the Lord."<br>
9 This was the Lord's reply to Moses.<br>
10 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel: If any of the people now or in future generations are ceremonially unclean at Passover time because of touching a dead body, or if they are on a journey and cannot be present at the ceremony, they may still celebrate the Lord's Passover.<br>
<br>
(They must offer the Passover sacrifice one month later, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the second month.)<br>
(This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late April, May, or early June.)<br>
<br>
11 They must offer the Passover sacrifice one month later, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the second month. They must eat the Passover lamb at that time with bitter salad greens and bread made without yeast.<br>
12 They must not leave any of the lamb until the next morning, and they must not break any of its bones. They must follow all the normal regulations concerning the Passover.<br>
13 "But those who neglect to celebrate the Passover at the regular time, even though they are ceremonially clean and not away on a trip, will be cut off from the community of Israel. If they fail to present the Lord's offering at the proper time, they will suffer the consequences of their guilt.<br>
14 And if foreigners living amongst you want to celebrate the Passover to the Lord, they must follow these same decrees and regulations. The same laws apply both to native-born Israelites and to the foreigners living amongst you."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
That's a great idea!<br>
If you find yourself having to deal with a special or unusual situation, and you're not sure what to do,<br>
Pray about it, and ask the Lord to give you instructions on how you should handle it, and how you should proceed.<br>
Doing it God's way, is always better, even if you don't understand why it is.<br>
<br>
<br>
Additional places that tell us about the Passover...<br>
NLT:<br>
Numbers 28: 16 & 17 NLT<br>
16<br>
(The fourteenth day of the first month, in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May.)<br>
On the fourteenth day of the first month, you must celebrate the Lord's Passover. <br>
17<br>
On the following day -- the fifteenth day of the month -- a joyous, seven-day festival will begin, but no bread made with yeast may be eaten.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 16: 1-8 KJV<br>
1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the Lord thy God: for in the month of Abib the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.<br>
2 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the Lord thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there.<br>
3 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.<br>
4 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.<br>
5 Thou mayest not sacrifice (or kill) the passover within any of thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee:<br>
6 But at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.<br>
7 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.<br>
8 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be (a restraint assembly) a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work therein.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 16: 1-8 NLT:<br>
<br>
(Abib, the first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar, usually occurs within the months of March and April.)<br>
<br>
1 "In honour of the Lord your God, celebrate the Passover each year in the early spring, in the month of Abib, (Observe the month of Abib,) and keep the Passover unto the Lord your God, for that was the month in which the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night.<br>
2 Your Passover sacrifice may be from either the flock or the herd, and it must be sacrificed to the Lord your God at the designated place of worship -- the place he chooses for his name to be honoured.<br>
3 Eat it with bread made without yeast. For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast, as when you escaped from Egypt in such a hurry. Eat this bread -- the bread of suffering -- so that as long as you live you will remember the day you departed from Egypt.<br>
4 Let no yeast be found in any house throughout your land for those seven days. And when you sacrifice the Passover lamb on the evening of the first day, do not let any of the meat remain until the next morning.<br>
5 "You may not sacrifice the Passover in just any of the towns that the Lord your God is giving you.<br>
6 You must offer it only at the designated place of worship -- the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honoured. Sacrifice it there in the evening as the sun goes down on the anniversary of your exodus from Egypt.<br>
7 Roast the lamb and eat it in the place the Lord your God chooses. Then you may go back to your tents the next morning.<br>
8 For the next six days you may not eat any bread made with yeast. On the seventh day proclaim another holy day in honour of the Lord your God, and no work may be done on that day.<br>
<br>

A number of events in the book of Ezra can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Persian records and related accurately to our modern calendar.<br>
This is how the NLT is able to produce such precise calendar dates, using our current calendar system.<br>
<br>
Ezra 6: 19-22 KJV<br>
19 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.<br>
20 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.<br>
21 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the Lord God of Israel, did eat,<br>
22 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the Lord had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.<br>
<br>
Ezra 6: 19-22<br>
NLT:<br>
19 On the 21st day of April in the year 515 BC, the returned exiles celebrated Passover. This day was on the fourteenth day of the first month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar.<br>
20 The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were ceremonially clean. So they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves.<br>
21 The Passover meal was eaten by the people of Israel who had returned from exile and by the others in the land who had turned from their corrupt practices to worship the Lord, the God of Israel.<br>
22 Then they celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. There was great joy throughout the land because the Lord had caused the king of Assyria to be favourable to them, so that he helped them to rebuild the Temple of God, the God of Israel.<br>
<br>
(King Darius of Persia is here identified in verse 22 as the king of Assyria because Persia had conquered the Babylonian Empire, which included the earlier Assyrian Empire.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 11: 23-29 KJV<br>
23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.<br>
24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;<br>
25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;<br>
26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.<br>
27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.<br>
28 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.<br>
29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 11: 23-29 NLT:<br>
23 It was by faith that Moses' parents hid him for three months when he was born. They saw that God had given them an unusual child, and they were not afraid to disobey the king's command.<br>
24 It was by faith that Moses, when he grew up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.<br>
25 He chose to share the oppression of God's people instead of enjoying the fleeting pleasures of sin.<br>
26 He thought it was better to suffer for the sake of Christ than to own the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his great reward.<br>
27 It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt, not fearing the king's anger. He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible.<br>
28 It was by faith that Moses commanded the people of Israel to keep the Passover and to sprinkle blood on the doorposts so that the angel of death would not kill their firstborn sons.<br>
29 It was by faith that the people of Israel went right through the Red Sea as though they were on dry ground. But when the Egyptians tried to follow, they were all drowned.<br>
<br>
We will be looking at two major areas within Exodus Chapter 12 here shortly, but, before we do, I wanted to show you something interesting there in Exodus 12.<br>
<br>
Exodus 12:5<br>
5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats.<br>
<br>
Genesis 22: 9-18 KJV<br>
9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.<br>
10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.<br>
11 And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.<br>
12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.<br>
13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.<br>
14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen. (Jehovah-jireh means, The Lord will see, or, The Lord will provide.)<br>
15 And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,<br>
16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:<br>
17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand (which is upon the sea lip,) which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;<br>
18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.<br>
<br>
Genesis 22: 9-18 NLT<br>
9 When they arrived at the place where God had told him to go, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. Then he tied his son, Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.<br>
10 And Abraham picked up the knife to kill his son as a sacrifice.<br>
11 At that moment the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!"<br>
"Yes," Abraham replied. "Here I am!"<br>
12 "Don't lay a hand on the boy!" the angel said. "Do not hurt him in any way, for now I know that you truly fear God. You have not withheld from me even your son, your only son."<br>
13 Then Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. So he took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering in place of his son.<br>
14 Abraham named the place Yahweh-Yireh (which means "the Lord will provide"). To this day, people still use that name as a proverb: "On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided."<br>
15 Then the angel of the Lord called again to Abraham from heaven.<br>
16 "This is what the Lord says: Because you have obeyed me and have not withheld even your son, your only son, I swear by my own name that<br>
17 I will certainly bless you. I will multiply (your seed,) your descendants beyond number, like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will conquer the cities of their enemies.<br>
18 And through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed -- all because you have obeyed me."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Bible indicates that, if you did not have the required lamb, you could use a goat.<br>
This lamb or goat option that we have here with the Passover, in Exodus 12:5, was also going on here in this other story with Abraham and Isaac, there in Genesis 22:13.<br>
If Isaac was a picture of the lamb of God, as a sacrifice, we see that he was quickly switched with a goat, and the goat, in other areas of Scripture, can be a picture of a sinner.<br>
It is no coincidence that satan worshippers have a goat in their religious symbol.<br>
The lamb of God who takes away our sin, and the sinner goat, get to switch places.<br>
The sinner gets to be forgiven and go to heaven, whilst the perfect lamb receives our punishment and pays the wages of sin that he did not do.<br>
Instead of the lamb (Isaac) you can use a goat instead.<br>
That's what the Lord and Abraham did in that story, and that is also what you can do with passover.<br>
If you don't have the lamb, use a young goat instead.<br>
If you, the goat, do not want to go to hell, do you believe that you can switch places with the perfect lamb and go to heaven?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: In Exodus 12, verse 9, the KJV says that you are to roast the lamb with the purtenance thereof.<br>
This means that you are to roast the lamb with the organs, guts and intestines left in the body whilst it roasts.<br>
This is only for the passover lamb.<br>
<br>
Purtenance is also known as the entrails.<br>
<br>
The Collins English Dictionary says that<br>
purtenance are the inner organs, the Viscera, which are the large organs inside the body, such as the heart, liver, and stomach.<br>
<br>
The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English says that entrails are<br>
the inside parts of an animal's or person's body, especially their intestines<br>
<br>
The Chambers 21st Century Dictionary says that<br>
entrails are the internal organs of a person or animal.<br>
<br>
The Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary says that<br>
entrails are the intestines and other inside organs of an animal or person<br>
<br>
The Collins English Dictionary says that<br>
The entrails of people or animals are their inside parts, especially their intestines<br>
-- the internal organs of a person or animal; intestines; guts<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We are getting close to the end of our Bible Study on the passover, but we still have a few more places to look at.<br>
Now, we will be reading two major parts of a very important chapter, in the book of Exodus, chapter 12.<br>
This is the very first passover, with the very first and original set of instructions on how to do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 12: 1-28 -- KJV<br>
1 And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,<br>
2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.<br>
3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb (or kid), according to the house of their fathers, a lamb (or kid) for an house:<br>
4 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.<br>
<br>
(Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male son of a year,)<br>
5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:<br>
<br>
<br>
6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.<br>
(and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it between the two evenings).<br>
<br>
7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.<br>
8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.<br>
9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.<br>
10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.<br>
11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord's passover.<br>
<br>
12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; (and against all the princes of Egypt) and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgement: I am the Lord.<br>
<br>
13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, (and the plague shall not be upon you for a destruction,) and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.<br>
14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.<br>
15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.<br>
<br>
16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, (save that which every soul must eat,) save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.<br>
<br>
17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.<br>
18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.<br>
19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.<br>
20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.<br>
<br>
21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb (or kid) according to your families, and kill the passover.<br>
<br>
22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.<br>
23 For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.<br>
24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.<br>
25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.<br>
26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?<br>
27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.<br>
28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 12: 1-28 -- NLT<br>
1 Whilst the Israelites were still in the land of Egypt, the Lord gave the following instructions to Moses and Aaron:<br>
2 "From now on, this month will be the first month of the year for you.<br>
3 Announce to the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each family must choose a lamb or a young goat for a sacrifice, one animal for each household.<br>
4 If a family is too small to eat a whole animal, let them share with another family in the neighbourhood. Divide the animal according to the size of each family and how much they can eat.<br>
5 The animal you select must be a one-year-old male, either a sheep or a goat, with no defects.<br>
6 "Take special care of this chosen animal until the evening of the fourteenth day of this first month. Then the whole assembly of the community of Israel must slaughter their lamb or young goat at twilight.<br>
7 They are to take some of the blood and smear it on the sides and top of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the animal.<br>
8 That same night they must roast the meat over a fire and eat it along with bitter salad greens and bread made without yeast.<br>
9 Do not eat any of the meat raw or boiled in water. The whole animal -- including the head, legs, and internal organs -- must be roasted over a fire.<br>
10 Do not leave any of it until the next morning. Burn whatever is not eaten before morning.<br>
<br>
11 "These are your instructions for eating this meal: (Bind up your loins,) Be fully dressed, wear your sandals, and carry your walking stick in your hand. Eat the meal with urgency, for this is the Lord's Passover.<br>
<br>
12 On that night I will pass through the land of Egypt and strike down every firstborn son and firstborn male animal in the land of Egypt. I will execute judgement against all the gods of Egypt, for I am the Lord!<br>
13 But the blood on your doorposts will serve as a sign, marking the houses where you are staying. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. This plague of death will not touch you when I strike the land of Egypt.<br>
14 "This is a day to remember. Each year, from generation to generation, you must celebrate it as a special festival to the Lord. This is a law for all time.<br>
15 For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast. On the first day of the festival, remove every trace of yeast from your homes. Anyone who eats bread made with yeast during the seven days of the festival will be cut off from the community of Israel.<br>
16 On the first day of the festival and again on the seventh day, all the people must observe an official day for holy assembly. No work of any kind may be done on these days except in the preparation of food.<br>
17 "Celebrate this Festival of Unleavened Bread, for it will remind you that I brought your forces out of the land of Egypt on this very day. This festival will be a permanent law for you; celebrate this day from generation to generation.<br>
18 The bread you eat must be made without yeast from the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month until the evening of the twenty-first day of that month.<br>
19 During those seven days, there must be no trace of yeast in your homes. Anyone who eats anything made with yeast during this week will be cut off from the community of Israel. These regulations apply both to the foreigners living amongst you and to the native-born Israelites.<br>
20 During those days you must not eat anything made with yeast. Wherever you live, eat only bread made without yeast."<br>
21 Then Moses called all the elders of Israel together and said to them, "Go, pick out a lamb or young goat for each of your families, and slaughter the Passover animal.<br>
22 Drain the blood into a basin. Then take a bundle of hyssop branches and dip it into the blood. Brush the hyssop across the top and sides of the doorframes of your houses. And no one may go out through the door until morning.<br>
23 For the Lord will pass through the land to strike down the Egyptians. But when he sees the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe, the Lord will pass over your home. He will not permit his death angel to enter your house and strike you down.<br>
24 "Remember, these instructions are a permanent law that you and your descendants must observe forever.<br>
25 When you enter the land the Lord has promised to give you, you will continue to observe this ceremony.<br>
26 Then your children will ask, 'What does this ceremony mean?'<br>
27 And you will reply, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, for he passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt. And though he struck the Egyptians, he spared our families.'" When Moses had finished speaking, all the people bowed down to the ground and worshiped.<br>
28 So the people of Israel did just as the Lord had commanded through Moses and Aaron.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 12: 42-51 -- KJV<br>
(It is a night of observations unto the LORD)<br>
12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.<br>
12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:<br>
12:44 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.<br>
12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.<br>
12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.<br>
12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.<br>
(All the congregation of Israel shall do it.)<br>
12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.<br>
12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth amongst you.<br>
12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.<br>
12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 12: 42-51 -- NLT<br>
42 On this night the Lord kept his promise to bring his people out of the land of Egypt. So this night belongs to him, and it must be commemorated every year by all the Israelites, from generation to generation.<br>
43 Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the instructions for the festival of Passover. No outsiders are allowed to eat the Passover meal.<br>
44 But any slave who has been purchased may eat it if he has been circumcised.<br>
45 Temporary residents and hired servants may not eat it.<br>
46 Each Passover lamb must be eaten in one house. Do not carry any of its meat outside, and do not break any of its bones.<br>
47 The whole community of Israel must celebrate this Passover festival.<br>
48 "If there are foreigners living amongst you who want to celebrate the Lord's Passover, let all their males be circumcised. Only then may they celebrate the Passover with you like any native-born Israelite. But no uncircumcised male may ever eat the Passover meal.<br>
49 This instruction applies to everyone, whether a native-born Israelite or a foreigner living amongst you."<br>
50 So all the people of Israel followed all the Lord's commands to Moses and Aaron.<br>
51 On that very day the Lord brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt like an army.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 34: 25-27 KJV<br>
25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.<br>
26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.<br>
27 And the Lord said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 34: 25-27 NLT<br>
25 "You must not offer the blood of my sacrificial offerings together with any baked goods containing yeast. And none of the meat of the Passover sacrifice may be kept over until the next morning.<br>
26 "As you harvest your crops, bring the very best of the first harvest to the house of the Lord your God.<br>
"You must not cook a young goat in its mother's milk."<br>
27 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write down all these instructions, for they represent the terms of the covenant I am making with you and with Israel."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 5: 10 & 11 KJV<br>
10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.<br>
11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.<br>
<br>
Joshua 5: 10 & 11 NLT<br>
10 Whilst the Israelites were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they celebrated Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month.<br>
(This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May.)<br>
11 The very next day they began to eat unleavened bread and roasted grain harvested from the land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 45: 21 & 22 KJV<br>
21 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.<br>
22 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 45: 21 & 22 NLT<br>
(This day, the fourteenth day of the first month, in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May.)<br>
21 "On the fourteenth day of the first month, you must celebrate the Passover. This festival will last for seven days. The bread you eat during that time must be made without yeast.<br>
22 On the day of Passover the prince will provide a young bull as a sin offering for himself and the people of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: A young bull? That's not what the original set of instructions said to do.<br>
At least they were trying to keep the Passover the best way that they knew how, using the resources available to them at that time and place.<br>
Again, as I said at the beginning of this Bible Study, we try our best to keep the Passover the best way that we know how, even if we are not able to do all of it perfectly and exactly in the way how the original instructions indicated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Before we finish this Bible Study, let's turn again to 1 Corinthians 5, which we looked at briefly at the beginning of this Bible Study on the Passover.<br>
We read in there how Jesus Christ is our Passover Lamb. Passover is not just a, when, or a, what. It is also a, who. The, who, is Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God who takes away our sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 5: 6-13 KJV<br>
KJV<br>
6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?<br>
7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:<br>
8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<br>
9 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:<br>
10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.<br>
11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.<br>
12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?<br>
13 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from amongst yourselves that wicked person.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 5: 7-13 NLT<br>
7 ...be like a fresh batch of dough made without yeast, which is what you really are. Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed, for us.<br>
8 So let us celebrate the festival, (not with old leaven,) not with the old bread of wickedness and evil, (but with unleavened, but with unleavened bread,) but with the new bread of sincerity and truth.<br>
9 When I wrote to you before, I told you not to associate with people who indulge in sexual sin.<br>
10 But I wasn't talking about unbelievers who indulge in sexual sin, or are greedy, or cheat people, or worship idols. You would have to leave this world to avoid people like that.<br>
(I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother)<br>
11 I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or is a drunkard, or cheats people. Don't even eat with such people.<br>
12 It isn't my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning.<br>
13 God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say (in Deuteronomy 17:7), "You must remove the evil person from amongst you."<br>
<br>
As we now bring this Bible Study about the Passover to a conclusion, here is our last, final verse to look at.<br>
This verse tells us what it was like following day, on the day after the first Passover.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 33: 3 & 4 KJV<br>
3 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.<br>
4 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the Lord had smitten amongst them: upon their gods also the Lord executed judgements.<br>
<br>
(This day, the fifteenth day of the first month, in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May.)<br>
<br>
Numbers 33: 3 & 4 NLT<br>
3 They set out from the city of Rameses in early spring -- on the fifteenth day of the first month -- on the morning after the first Passover celebration. The people of Israel left defiantly, in full view of all the Egyptians.<br>
4 Meanwhile, the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn sons, whom the Lord had killed the night before. The Lord had defeated the gods of Egypt that night with great acts of judgement!<br>
<br>
We now end our Bible Study with a quick prayer.<br>
<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, help us keep your feasts, and give them honour and value, and remember and understand their meaning, and what they represent.<br>
Help us keep them in the best way that we can, according to the circumstances and the resources available to us at that time.<br>
Help us not fail to do any steps or details that we are capable of doing, and help us not insert additional requirements or details into the feasts that are not in the set of instructions within the 66 books of the Holy Bible.<br>
Lord Jesus, we thankfully receive, accept and believe in the work that you did on the cross, and we thankfully receive your forgiveness.<br>
Help us love you, God, and love others.<br>
Show us what we can do for you each day, and show us how we can love and help others. We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, in Jesus' name, Amen.<br>
