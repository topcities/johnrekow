The apocryphal books (known as, Apocrypha) used to be part of the King James Version of the Bible when it was first released.<br>
Eventually the apocryphal books were removed by Protestants during the 1800s.<br>
<br>
The original manuscripts, original copies, the authors, origins, and the quality, translation precision, and accuracy, and authenticity of apocryphal books can be questioned and argued, and may not be 100% true, reliable and trustworthy.<br>
If one is cautious and careful, many of the one or two dozen additional books that used to be in the Bible can still be found and are available for reading, studying, evaluation and considering. Several of them might still be considered a valuable and important part of your overall Bible study. Keep that in mind, even though these Bible studies that we do here only look at the 66 books that we can easily access in our Bibles today, with a brief exception later on being the book of Enoch.<br>

    <h4>About The Bible</h4></p>
    <p>The Holy Bible that is commonly found today consists of 66 books, which are divided into two sections. </p>
    <p>In the front section, the first 39 books make up what is known as the Old Testament, which were books written before Jesus Christ was born. Of those, the oldest book in your Bible would be the book of Job (pronounced, "jobe"). We do not know exactly when Job was written.  Many Bible scholars agree with the more commonly accepted assessment that the book of Job may have been written around the time of 1500 BC, which is about three thousand, five hundred and twenty-four (3524) years ago, when counting back from the year of 2024 AD. Some have speculated that it may be about sixty to one hundred years newer than that, while others estimate that it might be anywhere from 300 to 600 years older than that.</p>
    <p>The second section, towards the back of the book, are the books of the New Testament, which consist of the remaining 27 books of the bible.  The New Testament books were all written in the decades after Jesus Christ died.  Jesus died in the year 33, and the last and newest book of the New Testament, also the last book at the end of the Bible, is the book of Revelation, which was mostly likely written in the year 96, but it could be even a year or two older than that. If the year of 96 is correct, and we count back from the year of 2024 AD, that would mean that the book of Revelation was written about one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-eight (1928) years ago.</p>
    <p>The Old Testament books were originally written in Hebrew, and the New Testament books were originally written in the Greek language. There have been five noteworthy occasions when a group of scholars each spent a number of years translating the entire Bible into English.  As a result, it is academically acknowledged that the following five English translations are acceptable as being accurate English versions of the ancient texts:</p>
    <p>King James Version (KJV) (1611)<br>
      New King James Version (NKJV) (1982)<br>
      New International Version (NIV) (1978, with revisions published in 1984 and 2011.)<br>
      New Living Translation (NLT) (1996, with revisions published in 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2015.)<br>
      New American Standard Bible (NASB) (1995)</p>
<p>
<br>
These English translations are the most accurate and the most recommended for your Bible studies, especially the KJV and NLT most of all.<br>
Reading the KJV and the NLT together, at the same time, can be one of the best ways to do a Bible study.<br>
Other interesting and noteworthy English translations to consider...<br>
<br>
TS2009 -- The Scriptures 2009<br>
Published by the Institute for Scripture Research (ISR)<br>
<br>
GNV -- Geneva Bible<br>
Public Domain.<br>
First published in the year 1560, 51 years before the KJV.<br>
The problem with this translation is that the Old English may be difficult to read and understand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>

    <p>There are several other English translations currently available, but they may not be considered to be as accurate. Some are known to be quite inaccurate and should be avoided. </p>
    <p><br>
      Each translation took a series of years to complete by each group of scholars.  Some portions were released in the few years immediately before the above years shown.  The years shown above are the years when each translation was completed and made available in its entirety. <br>
<br>
There are at least five different editions out there of the New Living Translation<br>
First edition: 1996<br>
Second edition: 2004<br>
Third edition: 2007<br>
Fourth edition: 2013<br>
Fifth edition: 2015<br>
<br>
The first edition is still considered to be a fairly good translation, but the newer editions are additional attempts to help improve the accuracy and precision of the NLT.<br>
The NLT is not just a word-for-word translation, but a thought-for-thought translation, trying to help give more thoughtful meaning and understanding of what was trying to be originally communicated.<br>
<br>
Different people all reading from the NLT may not each see the exact same wording in the NLT, due to the multiple revisions published.<br>
<br>
The NIV was updated in 1984 and 2011.<br>
Some have rejected the NIV 2011 update because of gender-neutral language.<br>
If different people are studying together in the NIV version, they may encounter differences in the wording due to the different NIV editions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even though there is now a 2020 edition of the New American Standard Bible (NASB), when we choose to occasionally quote the NASB, we will be quoting from the previous, 1995 edition, unless we specifically say otherwise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
    <p>
Warning!<br>
Some parts of the Bible contain strong adult content that may not be suitable for young children.<br>
Some people may find Bible studies to be offensive, and those offended people may respond with legal actions (lawsuits) or illegal, criminal actions.<br>
Some governments in some countries may have passed laws that make owning or reading a Bible to be illegal in certain places, and make take actions against those participants, resulting in prison, torture or death.<br>
Some of the content in a Bible study may contain Bible verse readings, quotations, commentaries, details and descriptions that may be considered graphic, sexually-explicit, disturbing or upsetting.<br>

251. Mark 16:15<br>
And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.<br>
<br>
Mark 16: 14-16 -- NLT<br>
14 Still later he appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating together. He rebuked them for their stubborn unbelief because they refused to believe those who had seen him after he had been raised from the dead. And they excused themselves, saying, "This age of lawlessness and unbelief is under Satan, who does not permit God's truth and power to conquer the evil (unclean) spirits. Therefore, reveal your justice now." This is what they said to Christ. And Christ replied to them, "The period of years of Satan's power has been fulfilled, but other dreadful things will happen soon. And I was handed over to death for those who have sinned, so that they may return to the truth and sin no more, and so they may inherit the spiritual, incorruptible, and righteous glory in heaven."<br>
15 And then he told them, "Go into all the world and preach the Good News to everyone.<br>
16 Anyone who believes and is baptised will be saved. But anyone who refuses to believe will be condemned.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Mark 16:14, what we just now looked at here in the NLT, only exists in this length in just a small number of some very early copies.<br>
Most copies do not have his longer version of verse 14.<br>
Research and close examination of verse 14 could produce the argument that,<br>
The disciples did not talk to Jesus in quite that kind of way, demanding that he reveal your justice now, and Jesus is usually referred to as Jesus, and not simply Christ, usually.<br>
And Jesus did not normally talk like that.<br>
Jesus never said things like, The period of years of Satan's power has been fulfilled.<br>
The different tone of voice and the the way how the conversation sounds in this verse 14, not sounding like the rest of the Book of Mark, could indicate that Mark did not actually write this.<br>
Catholic and satanic people have been known to make Bible translations, where they add, remove and change Bible verses in order to support their lies, and their false, fake and wrong religions.<br>
Catholic and satanic people have historical letters sent back and forth to each other, documenting their strategy and intention of weakening, removing, diluting, polluting and defiling Bible verses intentionally and deliberately.<br>
Then they publish their special translation that they claim is older and is more accurate, when these claims they make are really lies from satan.<br>
They add verses that do not exist, and have made hundreds of little changes in the NIV, and also in the Jehovah's Witness (JW) Bible, and many other modern translations, all of which can help to reduce and diminish the power and authority of Jesus Christ.<br>
Jesus Christ is God, and Jesus Christ is the son of the Most High God.<br>
No one can forgive your sins except Jesus Christ.<br>
No one can save you or me except Jesus Christ.<br>
I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. (a direct quote from Acts 8:37)<br>
<br>
Reading again what is found in our list here at random Bible verse number 43...<br>
John 1:1 -- KJV: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>
Commentary: The Word was and is God, it is not a god, it is the one and only God.<br>
Deuteronomy 6:4 says that The Lord our God is One Lord, not more than one, and not one of many.<br>
John 1:1 is corrupted in the Jehovah's Witness (JW) Bible, by simply adding a single letter to this verse.<br>
You see how easy it would be to corrupt, dilute and weaken your Bible in such a small way, so that you might not notice?<br>
<br>
The NLT does not entirely remove these verses, but they do move many of them into very small print in the margin notes.<br>
We always try to include what is in the margin notes in all of these Bible studies, which is what you see in round brackets.<br>
<br>

These verse numbers are literally skipped and missing in the NIV.<br>

<br>
Here is a Bible Study about times and seasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 25:21 (KJV)<br>
His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 8:10 (KJV)<br>
...the joy of the Lord is your strength.<br>
<br>
John 15:15 (KJV) Jesus said...<br>
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 17:17 (KJV)<br>
A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.<br>
NLT:<br>
A friend is always loyal, and a brother is born to help in time of need.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Jesus is your friend, and a friend loves you at all times, and in all seasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Job 1, verse 21 and 22.<br>
21 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.<br>
22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.<br>
(In all this Job sinned not, nor attributed folly to God.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Job 1<br>
NLT<br>
19<br>
Suddenly, a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and hit the house on all sides. The house collapsed, and all your children are dead. I am the only one who escaped to tell you."<br>
20<br>
Job stood up and tore his robe in grief. Then he shaved his head and fell to the ground to worship. <br>
21<br>
He said,<br>
"I came naked from my mother's womb,<br>
and I will be naked when I leave.<br>
The Lord gave me what I had,<br>
and the Lord has taken it away.<br>
Praise the name of the Lord!"<br>
22<br>
In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The bad things happened to Job in order to silence Satan, the accuser.<br>
What Job did not know at the time when those bad events were happening to him was the conversation earlier in heaven, between the Lord and Satan, the accuser.<br>
As we read in the book of Job, Job did not do anything wrong, and look what happened to him.<br>
Jesus did not do anything wrong, and look what happened to him.<br>
Sometimes, bad things happen to people even when they did not do anything wrong.<br>
<br>
Job 42:10 -- just 7 verses before the very end of the book of Job...<br>
10 And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.<br>
(also the Lord added all that had been to Job unto the double.)<br>
 <br>
Job 42:10 NLT:<br>
When Job prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes. In fact, the Lord gave him twice as much as before! <br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 3: 1-8 -- KJV:<br>
<br>
3:1 -- To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:<br>
3:2 -- A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;<br>
3:3 -- A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;<br>
3:4 -- A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;<br>
3:5 -- A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;<br>
3:6 -- A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;<br>
3:7 -- A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;<br>
3:8 -- A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What else does the Bible say about times and seasons?<br>
<br>
Repeating the two KJV verses listed earlier in the list, previously at positions 18 and 134...<br>
<br>
18. Galatians 6:9<br>
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. <br>
NLT: So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up. <br>
<br>
134. Psalms 1:3<br>
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither (shall not fade); and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. <br>
The Hebrew word for, "wither," can also mean, "fade." ...his leaf also shall not fade.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Psalms 31, it says in Verse 15:<br>
KJV: My times are in thy hand<br>
NLT: My future is in your hands.<br>
<br>
Original Hebrew meanings or Hebrew alternate meanings are indicated below in round brackets.<br>
<br>
Psalms 31  -- Verses 12 through 18 -- KJV<br>
12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel. (Heb. a vessel that perisheth)<br>
13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: whilst they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.<br>
14 But I trusted in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God.<br>
15 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.<br>
16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.<br>
17 Let me not be ashamed, O Lord; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in (or, cut off for) the grave.<br>
18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things (which speak a hard thing) proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 31  -- Verses 12 through 18 -- NLT<br>
I am ignored as if I were dead,<br>
as if I were a broken pot.<br>
I have heard the many rumours about me,<br>
and I am surrounded by terror.<br>
My enemies conspire against me,<br>
plotting to take my life.<br>
But I am trusting you, O Lord,<br>
saying, "You are my God!"<br>
My future is in your hands.<br>
Rescue me from those who hunt me down relentlessly.<br>
Let your favour shine on your servant.<br>
In your unfailing love, rescue me.<br>
Don't let me be disgraced, O Lord,<br>
for I call out to you for help.<br>
Let the wicked be disgraced;<br>
let them lie silent in the grave. (let them lie silent in Sheol.)<br>
Silence their lying lips--<br>
those proud and arrogant lips that accuse the godly.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word used above for the grave, is Shoel.<br>
Shoel is Hades or what we would call "Hell" --  the world of the dead (as if a subterranean retreat), including its accessories and inmates:--grave, hell, pit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Selah is a suspension of music, or a pause in the music, or an interlude.<br>
A Selah is a moment when you can stop and think about it, ponder it, and consider its value.<br>
<br>
In Psalms 62, both the KJV and NLT say in Verse 8, to <br>
Trust in him at all times.<br>
<br>
Psalms 62 -- Verses 5 through 8 -- KJV<br>
<br>
5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.<br>
6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.<br>
7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.<br>
8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.<br>
<br>
Psalms 62 -- Verses 5 through 8 -- NLT:<br>
Let all that I am wait quietly before God,<br>
for my hope is in him.<br>
He alone is my rock and my salvation,<br>
my fortress where I will not be shaken.<br>
My victory and honour come from God alone.<br>
He is my refuge, a rock where no enemy can reach me.<br>
O my people, trust in him at all times.<br>
Pour out your heart to him,<br>
for God is our refuge.<br>
(Interlude)<br>
<br>
<br>
So, once again, as just saw there in Psalms 31:15, and in Psalms 62:8...<br>
My times are in thy hand. (Our times are in His hands.)<br>
Trust in him at all times.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 2: 20-23 -- KJV<br>
Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:<br>
And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:<br>
He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.<br>
I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee....<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 2: 20-23 -- NLT:<br>
"Praise the name of God forever and ever,<br>
for he has all wisdom and power.<br>
He controls the course of world events;<br>
he removes kings and sets up other kings.<br>
He gives wisdom to the wise<br>
and knowledge to the scholars.<br>
He reveals deep and mysterious things<br>
and knows what lies hidden in darkness,<br>
though he is surrounded by light.<br>
I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors,<br>
for you have given me wisdom and strength.<br>
You have told me what we asked of you<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 1: 7 and 8 -- KJV:<br>
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.<br>
But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me....<br>
<br>
Acts 1: 7 & 8 -- NLT:<br>
(Jesus said,) "The Father alone has the authority to set those dates and times, and they are not for you to know. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere...."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
446. Matthew 26:41<br>
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.<br>
<br>
447. Matthew 24:42<br>
Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.<br>
<br>
195. Mark 14:38<br>
Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5: 1-9 -- KJV:<br>
5:1 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.<br>
5:2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.<br>
5:3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.<br>
5:4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.<br>
5:5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.<br>
5:6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.<br>
5:7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.<br>
5:8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.<br>
5:9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5: 1-11 -- NLT:<br>
1 Now concerning how and when all this will happen, dear brothers and sisters, we don't really need to write you.<br>
2 For you know quite well that the day of the Lord's return will come unexpectedly, like a thief in the night.<br>
3 When people are saying, "Everything is peaceful and secure," then disaster will fall on them as suddenly as a pregnant woman's labour pains begin. And there will be no escape.<br>
4 But you aren't in the dark about these things, dear brothers and sisters,<br>
(and you won't be surprised when the day of the Lord comes upon you as if you were thieves.)<br>
and you won't be surprised when the day of the Lord comes like a thief.<br>
5 For you are all children of the light and of the day; we don't belong to darkness and night.<br>
6 So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be clearheaded.<br>
7 Night is the time when people sleep and drinkers get drunk.<br>
8 But let us who live in the light be clearheaded, protected by the armour of faith and love, and wearing as our helmet the confidence of our salvation.<br>
9 For God chose to save us through our Lord Jesus Christ, not to pour out his anger on us.<br>
10 Christ died for us so that, whether we are dead or alive when he returns, we can live with him forever.<br>
11 So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.<br>

<br>
Revelation 3:3 -- NLT<br>

Revelation 3:3 -- TS2009<br>

Ephesians 6: 10-19 -- KJV:<br>
6:10  -- Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.<br>
6:11 -- Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.<br>
6:12  -- For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>
6:13  -- Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<br>
6:14  -- Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;<br>
6:15  -- And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;<br>
6:16  -- Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.<br>
6:17  -- And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:<br>
6:18  -- Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;<br>
6:19  -- And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,<br>

Ephesians 6: 10-19 -- NLT:<br>
10 A final word: Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.<br>
11 Put on all of God's armour so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil. <br>
<br>
(For you are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies,)<br>
12 For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places.<br>
<br>
13 Therefore, put on every piece of God's armour so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm.<br>
14 Stand your ground, putting on the belt of truth and the body armour of God's righteousness.<br>

15 For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you will be fully prepared.<br>

(Hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the evil one.)<br>
<br>
<br>
17 Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<br>

<br>
18 Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere.<br>
<br>
(Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all of God's holy people.)<br>
<br>
19 And pray for me, too. Ask God to give me the right words so I can boldly explain God's mysterious plan that the Good News is for Jews and Gentiles alike.<br>
<br>
(Ask God to give me the right words so I can simply explain the mystery.)<br>

Commentary:  The summary of all of this is, it is not for us to know the times and the seasons of when things are going to happen.<br>
God is the one who has power over all such times and seasons.  The times and the seasons are in His hands. Fear the Lord, Obey the Lord, and Follow the Lord, because God is the one with the perfect plan for you and your life.<br>
The events of the future and the events of the end times will all happen unexpectedly.<br>
The way how we can prepare for the unknown future, the upcoming events and spiritual battles against spiritual wickedness in high places, and the events leading up to the end times, the way how we can prepare for all of those things, is to put on the armour of God.<br>
Did you notice how, right after you are made aware of the spiritual battle, you are told to put on the armour of God?<br>
Each item has a special, symbolic meaning, and protects that particular area of the body for a reason.<br>
When you study this scripture, think carefully about each item, what its name is, and that area of the body, and what that part of the body does.<br>
If it does not make much sense to you, then, for now, you can Pray right now to the Lord and ask Him to help you put on the full armour of God.<br>
<br>
By keeping our trust and our focus on our Lord Jesus, every day and in every situation, that is how we make it through all times and seasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
This concludes our Bible study about times and seasons.<br>

This study here was originally just a quick reading of the famous Psalms 23.<br>
Then, in July of 2023, my daughter gave me a beautiful, hand-sewn picture of<br>
a door that is open, and, looking through the open door, on the other side is<br>
a good, right path to walk on, next to a patch of a green pasture with tender grass, growing next to a peaceful, quiet stream.<br>

Isaiah 22: 22-25 -- King James Version (KJV) (1611)<br>
22:22 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.<br>
22:23 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.<br>
22:24 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons (even to all the instruments of viols).<br>
22:25 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 22: 22-25 -- New Living Translation, 5th Edition (NLT) (1996, 2004, 2007, 2015)<br>
22 I will give him the key to the house of David -- the highest position in the royal court. When he opens doors, no one will be able to close them; when he closes doors, no one will be able to open them.<br>
23 He will bring honour to his family name, for I will drive him firmly in place like a nail in the wall.<br>
<br>
(They will hang on him all the glory of his father's house: its offspring and offshoots, all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.)<br>
24 They will give him great responsibility, and he will bring honour to even the lowliest members of his family."<br>
25 But the Lord of Heaven's Armies also says: "The time will come when I will pull out the nail that seemed so firm. It will come out and fall to the ground. Everything it supports will fall with it. I, the Lord, have spoken!"<br>

22 And I shall place the key of the house of David on his shoulder. And he shall open, and no one shuts; and shall shut, and no one opens.<br>
23 And I shall fasten him like a peg in a steadfast place, and he shall become a throne of esteem to his father's house.<br>
24 And they shall hang on him all the weight of his father's house, the offspring and the offshoots, all vessels of small quantity, from the cups to all the jars.<br>
25 In that day,' declares Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, 'the peg that is fastened in the steadfast place shall be removed and be cut down and fall, and the burden that was on it shall be cut off. For Yaw-Who-Wah has spoken.' "<br>

8 "I know all the things you do, and I have opened a door for you that no one can close. You have little strength, yet you obeyed my word and did not deny me.<br>
9 Look, I will force those who belong to Satan's synagogue -- those liars who say they are Jews but are not -- to come and bow down at your feet. They will acknowledge that you are the ones I love.<br>
10 "Because you have obeyed my command to persevere, I will protect you from the great time of testing that will come upon the whole world to test those who belong to this world.<br>

The TS2009 using the word, "renewed," instead of "new" can be argued as being a translation mistake. We will talk some more about this TS2009 mistake, also found in the Eth Cepher, when we talk about Communion in The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter One, better known as Christian Essays 1.<br>

John 10: 7-16 (KJV)<br>
10:7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.<br>
10:8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.<br>
10:9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.<br>
10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.<br>
10:11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.<br>
10:12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.<br>
10:13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.<br>
10:14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.<br>
10:15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.<br>
10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 10: 7-16 (NLT)<br>
7 so he explained it to them: "I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.<br>
8 All who came before me were thieves and robbers. But the true sheep did not listen to them.<br>
9 Yes, I am the gate.<br>
(Those who come in through me will find safety.)<br>
Those who come in through me will be saved. They will come and go freely and will find good pastures.<br>
10 The thief's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy. My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.<br>
11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep.<br>
12 A hired hand will run when he sees a wolf coming. He will abandon the sheep because they don't belong to him and he isn't their shepherd. And so the wolf attacks them and scatters the flock.<br>
13 The hired hand runs away because he's working only for the money and doesn't really care about the sheep.<br>
14 "I am the good shepherd; I know my own sheep, and they know me,<br>
15 just as my Father knows me and I know the Father. So I sacrifice my life for the sheep.<br>
16 I have other sheep, too, that are not in this sheepfold. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock with one shepherd.<br>

John 10: 7-16 (TS2009)<br>

8 "All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.<br>
9 "I am the door. Whoever enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and find pasture.<br>
10 "The thief does not come except to steal, and to slaughter, and to destroy. I have come that they might possess life, and that they might possess it beyond measure.<br>
11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.<br>
12 "But the hireling, and not being a shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees. And the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them.<br>
13 "Now the hireling flees because he is a hireling and is not concerned about the sheep.<br>
14 "I am the good shepherd. And I know Mine, and Mine know Me,<br>
15 even as the Father knows Me, and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.<br>
16 "And other sheep I have which are not of this fold  --  I have to bring them as well, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.<br>

I will not be afraid,<br>
for you are close beside me.<br>
Your rod and your staff<br>
protect and comfort me.<br>

You prepare a feast for me<br>
in the presence of my enemies.<br>
You honour me by anointing my head with oil.<br>
My cup overflows with blessings.<br>
6<br>
Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me<br>
all the days of my life,<br>
and I will live in the house of the Lord<br>
forever.<br>

1 Yaw-Who-Wah is my shepherd; I do not lack.<br>

5 You spread before me a table in the face of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup runs over.<br>

1 Corinthians 13<br>
(Suggested Bible Study: The Love-is List -- The List of what Love is, is here on Verse 4.)<br>
1 Corinthians 13 -- KJV:<br>
13:1 --  Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.<br>
13:2 --  And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.<br>
13:3 -- And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.<br>
13:4 -- Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,<br>
13:5 --  Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;<br>
13:6  -- Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;<br>
13:7 --  Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.<br>
13:8 --  Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.<br>
13:9  -- For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.<br>
13:10 --  But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.<br>
13:11 --  When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.<br>
13:12 --  For now we see through a glass, darkly *; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.<br>
13:13  -- And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 13 -- NLT:<br>
If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn't love others, I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God's secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn't love others, I would be nothing. If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it; but if I didn't love others, I would have gained nothing.<br>
13:4 -- Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.<br>
Prophecy and speaking in unknown languages and special knowledge will become useless. But love will last forever! Now our knowledge is partial and incomplete, and even the gift of prophecy reveals only part of the whole picture! But when the time of perfection comes, these partial things will become useless.<br>
When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things. Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity. All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything completely, just as God now knows me completely.<br>
Three things will last forever -- faith, hope, and love -- and the greatest of these is love.<br>

Would you like to know?  <br>
<br>
All you have to do is go to the beach, seashore or seaside, and start counting every little grain of sand, all of the sand, including the sand under the ocean.<br>
Keep counting, until you have counted all of the sand on the entire planet.  When you finally come up with that number, that number is still not big enough.<br>
<br>
And, what kind of thoughts are those many, many thoughts? Are they sad thoughts of disappointment?  Not at all!<br>
His thoughts towards you are precious!  Every single one of them.<br>

I can't even count them;<br>
they outnumber the grains of sand!<br>
And when I wake up,<br>
you are still with me!<br>

Psalms 27<br>
KJV:<br>
A Psalm of David.<br>
1 The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?<br>
2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, (approached against me) came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.<br>
3 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.<br>
4 One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, (or the delight of the Lord) and to enquire in his temple.<br>
5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.<br>
6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy (sacrifices of shouting); I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.<br>
7 Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.<br>
8 (My heart said unto thee, Let my face seek thy face.) When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.<br>
9 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.<br>
10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up. (then the Lord will gather me.)<br>
11 Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, (lead me in a way of plainness) because of mine enemies. (because of those which observe me.)<br>
12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.<br>
13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.<br>
14 Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.<br>
<br>
Psalms 27<br>
NLT: <br>
A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
The Lord is my light and my salvation--<br>
so why should I be afraid?<br>
The Lord is my fortress, protecting me from danger,<br>
so why should I tremble?<br>
2<br>
When evil people come to devour me,<br>
when my enemies and foes attack me,<br>
they will stumble and fall.<br>
3<br>
Though a mighty army surrounds me,<br>
my heart will not be afraid.<br>
Even if I am attacked,<br>
I will remain confident.<br>
4<br>
The one thing I ask of the Lord--<br>
the thing I seek most--<br>
is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,<br>
delighting in the Lord's perfections<br>
and meditating in his Temple.<br>
5<br>
For he will conceal me there when troubles come;<br>
he will hide me in his sanctuary.<br>
He will place me out of reach on a high rock.<br>
6<br>
Then I will hold my head high<br>
above my enemies who surround me.<br>
At his sanctuary I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy,<br>
singing and praising the Lord with music.<br>

Hear me as I pray, O Lord.<br>
Be merciful and answer me!<br>
8<br>
My heart has heard you say, "Come and talk with me."<br>
And my heart responds, "Lord, I am coming."<br>
9<br>
Do not turn your back on me.<br>
Do not reject your servant in anger.<br>
You have always been my helper.<br>
Don't leave me now; don't abandon me,<br>
O God of my salvation!<br>
10<br>
Even if my father and mother abandon me,<br>
the Lord will hold me close.<br>
11<br>
Teach me how to live, O Lord.<br>
Lead me along the right path,<br>
for my enemies are waiting for me.<br>
12<br>
Do not let me fall into their hands.<br>
For they accuse me of things I've never done;<br>
with every breath they threaten me with violence.<br>
13<br>
Yet I am confident I will see the Lord's goodness<br>
whilst I am here in the land of the living.<br>
