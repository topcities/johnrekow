<br>
<br>
Division & Wrath<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Satan uses evil to kill, steal, and destroy people, families, churches, fellowships and relationships.<br>
The purpose of this Bible study is to help us identify and recognise the approach of evil, the deception of evil,<br>
and the attacks of evil.<br>
We need to ask Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw to rebuke and cast out that evil.<br>
He will deliver us from evil, and we need to put away all forms of evil.<br>
Don't try to welcome and hug something that you are supposed to put away.<br>
Don't try to welcome and hug the sin that you are supposed to put away.<br>
Don't try to welcome and hug the sinful people that you are supposed to get away from and stay away from.<br>
Don't put away the people that you are supposed to love, serve and help.<br>
How can you tell the difference?<br>
<br>
When the lions want to kill a gazelle, their common strategy is to first divide and separate the individuals from the herd or main group.<br>
Then, cause the individual to run in the wrong direction, away from the help of the herd, isolating it.<br>
Then they target the isolated, lonely individual, so they can surround it, attack it and kill it and devour it.<br>
Satan uses evil sinners to cause division and separation among the group of believers.<br>
Let's focus on some areas of Scripture that will teach us more about those that try to cause arguing, quarrelling, and division.<br>
Then, the Bible will teach us on how to identify them, and what to do to stop and fix issues of this kind.<br>
So, you can all plop down, and fasten your selt belts, as we now go on a journey through the Scriptures!<br>
<br>
Proverbs 6: 16-19 (KJV)<br>
6:16 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:<br>
(seven are an abomination of his soul:)<br>
6:17 A proud look, (also known as, haughty eyes,) a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,<br>
6:18 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,<br>
6:19 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 6: 16-19 (NLT)<br>
16<br>
There are six things the Lord hates --<br>
no, seven things he detests:<br>
17<br>
haughty eyes,<br>
a lying tongue,<br>
hands that kill the innocent,<br>
18<br>
a heart that plots evil,<br>
feet that race to do wrong,<br>
19<br>
a false witness who pours out lies,<br>
a person who sows discord in a family.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 6: 16-19 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
16 These six matters Yaw-Who-Wah hates, And seven are an abomination to Him:<br>
17 A proud look, A lying tongue, And hands shedding innocent blood,<br>
18 A heart devising wicked schemes, Feet quick to run to evil,<br>
19 A false witness breathing out lies, And one who causes strife among brothers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 7: 38-43 (KJV)<br>
7:38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<br>
7:39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)<br>
7:40 Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.<br>
7:41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?<br>
7:42 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?<br>
7:43 So there was a division among the people because of him.<br>
<br>
John 7: 38-43 NLT<br>
(Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink.)<br>
(For the Scriptures declare, Rivers of living water will flow from the heart of anyone who believes in me.)<br>
<br>
38 Anyone who believes in me may come and drink! For the Scriptures declare, 'Rivers of living water will flow from his heart.'"<br>
<br>
39 (When he said "living water," he was speaking of the Spirit, who would be given to everyone believing in him. But the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet entered into his glory.)<br>
(But as yet there was no Spirit, But as yet there was no Holy Spirit, because Jesus had not yet entered into his glory.)<br>
<br>
40 When the crowds heard him say this, some of them declared, "Surely this man is the Prophet we've been expecting."<br>
(referring to Deuteronomy 18:15, 18; and Malachi 4:5-6)<br>
<br>
41 Others said, "He is the Messiah." Still others said, "But he can't be! Will the Messiah come from Galilee?<br>
<br>
42 For the Scriptures clearly state that the Messiah will be born of the royal line of David, in Bethlehem, the village where King David was born."<br>
(remembering what is said in Micah 5:2)<br>
43 So the crowd was divided about him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 10: 14-21 (KJV)<br>
10:14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.<br>
10:15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.<br>
10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.<br>
10:17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.<br>
10:18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.<br>
10:19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.<br>
10:20 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?<br>
10:21 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?<br>
<br>
John 10: 14-21 NLT<br>
14 "I am the good shepherd; I know my own sheep, and they know me,<br>
15 just as my Father knows me and I know the Father. So I sacrifice my life for the sheep.<br>
16 I have other sheep, too, that are not in this sheepfold. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock with one shepherd.<br>
17 "The Father loves me because I sacrifice my life so I may take it back again.<br>
18 No one can take my life from me. I sacrifice it voluntarily. For I have the authority to lay it down when I want to and also to take it up again. For this is what my Father has commanded."<br>
19 When he said these things, the people were again divided in their opinions about him.<br>
(When he said these things, the Jewish people were again divided in their opinions about him.)<br>
20 Some said, "He's demon possessed and out of his mind. Why listen to a man like that?"<br>
21 Others said, "This doesn't sound like a man possessed by a demon! Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 8: 23 & 24 (KJV)<br>
(And I will put a redemption between my people and thy people: by tomorrow shall this sign be.)<br>
8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.<br>
8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.<br>
(the land was destroyed by reason of the swarm of flies.)<br>
<br>
Exodus 8: 23 & 24 NLT<br>
(I will set redemption between my people and your people.)<br>
23 I will make a clear distinction between my people and your people. This miraculous sign will happen tomorrow.'"<br>
24 And the Lord did just as he had said. A thick swarm of flies filled Pharaoh's palace and the houses of his officials. The whole land of Egypt was thrown into chaos by the flies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 49-52 (KJV)<br>
12:49 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?<br>
12:50 But I have a baptism to be baptised with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!<br>
(and how am I pained till it be accomplished!)<br>
12:51 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:<br>
12:52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 49-52 NLT<br>
49 "I have come to set the world on fire, and I wish it were already burning!<br>
50 I have a terrible baptism of suffering ahead of me, and I am under a heavy burden until it is accomplished.<br>
51 Do you think I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I have come to divide people against each other!<br>
52 From now on families will be split apart, three in favour of me, and two against -- or two in favour and three against.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Judges 5: 15 & 16 (KJV)<br>
(And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent his feet into the valley. In the divisions of Reuben there were great impressions of heart.)<br>
(Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? In the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.)<br>
5:15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.<br>
5:16 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
Judges 5: 15 & 16 NLT<br>
15<br>
The princes of Issachar were with Deborah and Barak.<br>
They followed Barak, rushing into the valley.<br>
But in the tribe of Reuben there was great indecision.<br>
(But in the tribe of Reuben there was great searchings of heart.)<br>
(But in the tribe of Reuben there was great resolve of heart.)<br>
16<br>
Why did you sit at home among the sheepfolds --<br>
to hear the shepherds whistle for their flocks?<br>
Yes, in the tribe of Reuben<br>
there was great indecision.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 16: 17-20 (KJV)<br>
16:17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.<br>
16:18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.<br>
16:19 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.<br>
(but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and harmless concerning evil.)<br>
(And the God of peace shall tread Satan under your feet shortly.)<br>
16:20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.<br>
<br>
Romans 16: 17-20 NLT<br>
17 And now I make one more appeal, my dear brothers and sisters. Watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people's faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught. Stay away from them.<br>
18 Such people are not serving Christ our Lord; they are serving their own personal interests. By smooth talk and glowing words they deceive innocent people.<br>
19 But everyone knows that you are obedient to the Lord. This makes me very happy. I want you to be wise in doing right and to stay innocent of any wrong.<br>
20 The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.<br>
(May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1:10 (KJV)<br>
Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing,<br>
(and that there be no schisms among you;)<br>
and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgement.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT<br>
(I appeal to you, dear brothers,)<br>
10 I appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, to live in harmony with each other. Let there be no divisions in the church. Rather, be of one mind, united in thought and purpose.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1:13 (KJV)<br>
Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptised in the name of Paul?<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1:13 NLT<br>
13 Has Christ been divided into factions? Was I, Paul, crucified for you? Were any of you baptised in the name of Paul? Of course not!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3: 2 & 3 (KJV)<br>
3:2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.<br>
3:3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?<br>
(For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and factions, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?)<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3: 1-3 NLT<br>
(Dear brothers,)<br>
1 Dear brothers and sisters, when I was with you I couldn't talk to you as I would to spiritual people.<br>
(when I was with you I couldn't talk to you as I would to people who have the Spirit.)<br>
I had to talk as though you belonged to this world or as though you were infants in Christ.<br>
2 I had to feed you with milk, not with solid food, because you weren't ready for anything stronger. And you still aren't ready,<br>
3 for you are still controlled by your sinful nature. You are jealous of one another and quarrel with each other. Doesn't that prove you are controlled by your sinful nature? Aren't you living like people of the world?<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11: 13-22 (KJV)<br>
11:13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?<br>
11:14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?<br>
11:15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.<br>
(for her hair is given her for a veil.)<br>
11:16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.<br>
11:17 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.<br>
11:18 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; (I hear that there be schisms among you;) and I partly believe it.<br>
11:19 (For there must be also sects among you,) For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.<br>
11:20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.<br>
(When ye come together therefore into one place, ye cannot eat the Lord's supper.)<br>
11:21 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.<br>
11:22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not?<br>
(and shame them that are poor?)<br>
What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11: 17-22 NLT<br>
17 But in the following instructions, I cannot praise you. For it sounds as if more harm than good is done when you meet together.<br>
18 First, I hear that there are divisions among you when you meet as a church, and to some extent I believe it.<br>
19 But, of course, there must be divisions among you so that you who have God's approval will be recognised!<br>
20 When you meet together, you are not really interested in the Lord's Supper.<br>
21 For some of you hurry to eat your own meal without sharing with others. As a result, some go hungry whilst others get drunk.<br>
22 What? Don't you have your own homes for eating and drinking? Or do you really want to disgrace God's church and shame the poor? What am I supposed to say? Do you want me to praise you? Well, I certainly will not praise you for this!<br>

1 Corinthians 12:22 and reading non-stop into the next chapter, stopping at 1 Corinthians 13:3 (KJV)<br>
12:22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:<br>
12:23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable,<br>
(upon these we put on more abundant honour;)<br>
upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.<br>
12:24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:<br>
12:25 That there should be no schism in the body;<br>
(That there should be no division in the body;)<br>
but that the members should have the same care one for another.<br>
12:26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<br>
12:27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.<br>
12:28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles,<br>
then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues (kinds of tongues).<br>
12:29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? (are all powers of miracles?)<br>
12:30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?<br>
12:31 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.<br>
13:1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.<br>
13:2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.<br>
13:3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 12:20 and reading non-stop into the next chapter, stopping at 1 Corinthians 13:5 -- NLT<br>
20 Yes, there are many parts, but only one body.<br>
21 The eye can never say to the hand, "I don't need you." The head can't say to the feet, "I don't need you."<br>
22 In fact, some parts of the body that seem weakest and least important are actually the most necessary.<br>
23 And the parts we regard as less honourable are those we clothe with the greatest care. So we carefully protect those parts that should not be seen,<br>
24 whilst the more honourable parts do not require this special care. So God has put the body together such that extra honour and care are given to those parts that have less dignity.<br>
25<br>
This makes for harmony among the members, so that all the members care for each other.<br>
26<br>
If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it, and if one part is honoured, all the parts are glad.<br>
27<br>
All of you together are Christ's body, and each of you is a part of it.<br>
28<br>
Here are some of the parts God has appointed for the church:<br>
first are apostles,<br>
second are prophets,<br>
third are teachers,<br>
then those who do miracles,<br>
those who have the gift of healing,<br>
those who can help others,<br>
those who have the gift of leadership,<br>
those who speak in unknown languages.<br>
29<br>
Are we all apostles? Are we all prophets? Are we all teachers? Do we all have the power to do miracles?<br>
30 Do we all have the gift of healing? Do we all have the ability to speak in unknown languages? Do we all have the ability to interpret unknown languages? Of course not!<br>
31 So you should earnestly desire the most helpful gifts.<br>
But now let me show you a way of life that is best of all.<br>
1 If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn't love others, I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.<br>
2 If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God's secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn't love others, I would be nothing.<br>
3 If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it; but if I didn't love others, I would have gained nothing.<br>
4 Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud<br>
5 or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged.<br>

Acts 14: 1-4 (KJV)<br>
14:1 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.<br>
14:2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.<br>
14:3 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.<br>
14:4 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.<br>
<br>
Acts of the Apostles 13:44 and reading non-stop into the next chapter, stopping at Acts of the Apostles 14:4 -- NLT<br>
44 The following week almost the entire city turned out to hear them preach the word of the Lord.<br>
45 But when some of the Jews saw the crowds, they were jealous; so they slandered Paul and argued against whatever he said.<br>
46 Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and declared, "It was necessary that we first preach the word of God to you Jews. But since you have rejected it and judged yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we will offer it to the Gentiles.<br>
47<br>
For the Lord gave us this command when he said,<br>
'I have made you a light to the Gentiles,<br>
to bring salvation to the farthest corners of the earth.'"<br>
(quoting from Isaiah 49:6)<br>
48 When the Gentiles heard this, they were very glad and thanked the Lord for his message; and all who were chosen for eternal life became believers.<br>
49 So the Lord's message spread throughout that region.<br>
50 Then the Jews stirred up the influential religious women and the leaders of the city, and they incited a mob against Paul and Barnabas and ran them out of town.<br>
51 So they shook the dust from their feet as a sign of rejection and went to the town of Iconium.<br>
(And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.)<br>
52 And the believers were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.<br>
1 The same thing happened in Iconium.<br>
(The same thing happened in Iconium, as well as Lystra and Derbe, which were all towns in what is now Turkey.)<br>
Paul and Barnabas went to the Jewish synagogue and preached with such power that a great number of both Jews and Greeks became believers.<br>
2 Some of the Jews, however, spurned God's message and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against Paul and Barnabas.<br>
3 But the apostles stayed there a long time, preaching boldly about the grace of the Lord. And the Lord proved their message was true by giving them power to do miraculous signs and wonders.<br>
4 But the people of the town were divided in their opinion about them. Some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.<br>

Galatians 5:15 and reading non-stop into the next chapter, stopping at Galatians 6:2 (KJV)<br>
5:15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.<br>
5:16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.<br>
(fulfil not the lust of the flesh.)<br>
5:17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.<br>
5:18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.<br>
5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,<br>
5:20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,<br>
5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.<br>
5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,<br>
5:23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.<br>
5:24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.<br>
(And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the passions and lusts.)<br>
5:25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<br>
5:26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.<br>
(Brethren, although a man be overtaken in a fault,)<br>
6:1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.<br>
6:2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.<br>
<br>
Galatians 5:15 and reading non-stop into the next chapter, stopping at Galatians 6:6 -- NLT<br>
15 But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out! Beware of destroying one another.<br>
16 So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won't be doing what your sinful nature craves.<br>
17 The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions.<br>
18 But when you are directed by the Spirit, you are not under obligation to the law of Moses.<br>
19 When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures,<br>
20 idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarrelling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division,<br>
21 envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.<br>
22 But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<br>
23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!<br>
24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there.<br>
25 Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit's leading in every part of our lives.<br>
26 Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another.<br>
(Dear Brothers, if a man is overcome by some sin, you who are spiritual should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path.)<br>
1 Dear brothers and sisters, if another believer is overcome by some sin, you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path.<br>
And be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself.<br>
2 Share each other's burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ.<br>
3 If you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself. You are not that important.<br>
4 Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won't need to compare yourself to anyone else.<br>
5 For we are each responsible for our own conduct.<br>
6 Those who are taught the word of God should provide for their teachers, sharing all good things with them.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  We're not just talking about sharing money or provisions here with your teachers.<br>
When you see good things in the Bible worth sharing, share it with your teachers, sharing all good things with them.<br>

(Remember, he has put his seal on you.)<br>
Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.<br>
31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behaviour.<br>

Colossians 3:8 (KJV)<br>
But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.<br>

Colossians 3:8 NLT<br>
8 But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behaviour, slander, and dirty language.<br>
<br>
We will go back to Colossians 3 here in just a moment.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Filthy communication and dirty language may be more than just profanity and bad words. It could be something that might sound good and true and honest, and it could be nothing else but the careful reading and sharing of Torah and Scriptures, but you never really know if it may produce judgements, interpretations, thoughts, attitudes and feelings that might lead a person down a chain of thought or train of thought towards sin and division.<br>
For example, I might encourage someone to do the Lord's supper, which is communion, and even though my intensions were good, it could lead that person to drinking an entire bottle of wine on Friday night, and then another whole bottle on Saturday, causing that person to stumble into an addiction of alcoholism. It's not just about being careful what you transmit, it's also being careful about what you receive, and how you process and react to someone's conversation and communication. For example, Scriptures that promote alcohol consumption do not give anyone permission to become an alcoholic.  There might be a good reason why you might feel led not to read and share certain Bible verses with certain people, even though you are clearly true and right about what you want to say. This is just something to think about and pray about when you share and fellowship with others.<br>

Psalms 37: 7-11 (KJV)<br>

37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.<br>
37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.<br>
37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.<br>
37:11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br>

Psalms 37: 7-11 NLT<br>

Be still in the presence of the Lord,<br>

Don't worry about evil people who prosper<br>

Stop being angry!<br>
Turn from your rage!<br>
Do not lose your temper --<br>

the wicked fall beneath their load of sin.<br>

The godliness of good people rescues them;<br>
the ambition of treacherous people traps them.<br>

(so is a fair woman which departeth from discretion.)<br>
11:23 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.<br>
11:24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.<br>
11:25 The liberal soul (the soul of blessing) shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 11: 21-25 NLT<br>

Evil people will surely be punished,<br>
but the children of the godly will go free.<br>
22<br>
A beautiful woman who lacks discretion<br>
is like a gold ring in a pig's snout.<br>
23<br>
The godly can look forward to a reward,<br>
whilst the wicked can expect only judgement.<br>

Give freely and become more wealthy;<br>
be stingy and lose everything.<br>

The generous will prosper;<br>
those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed.<br>

Let's look again at a few more verses in Colossians 3...<br>
Colossians 3: 2-8 (KJV)<br>
3:2 (Set your mind on things above) Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.<br>
3:3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<br>
3:4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.<br>
3:5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:<br>
3:6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:<br>
3:7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.<br>
3:8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.<br>
<br>
Colossians 2:20 and reading non-stop into the next chapter, stopping at Colossians 3:8 NLT<br>
20 You have died with Christ, and he has set you free from the spiritual powers of this world. So why do you keep on following the rules of the world, such as,<br>
21 "Don't handle! Don't taste! Don't touch!"?<br>
22 Such rules are mere human teachings about things that deteriorate as we use them.<br>
23 These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion, pious self-denial, and severe bodily discipline. But they provide no help in conquering a person's evil desires.<br>
1 Since you have been raised to new life with Christ, set your sights on the realities of heaven, where Christ sits in the place of honour at God's right hand.<br>
2 Think about the things of heaven, not the things of earth.<br>
3 For you died to this life, and your real life is hidden with Christ in God.<br>
4 And when Christ, (who is our life,) who is your life, is revealed to the whole world, you will share in all his glory.<br>
5 So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires. Don't be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater, worshipping the things of this world.<br>
6 Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming.<br>
(Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming on all who disobey him.)<br>
7 You used to do these things when your life was still part of this world.<br>
8 But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behaviour, slander, and dirty language.<br>
<br>
We read to the end of Ephesians 4 a little while ago.  Let's go back to there again, and keep reading into the next chapter.<br>
Ephesians 4:31 and reading non-stop into the next chapter, stopping at Ephesians 5:11 (KJV)<br>
4:31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:<br>
4:32 And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.<br>
5:1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;<br>
5:2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<br>
5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;<br>
5:4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.<br>
5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<br>
5:6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: (for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of unbelief.)<br>
for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.<br>
5:7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.<br>
5:8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:<br>
5:9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)<br>
5:10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.<br>
5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.<br>

31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behaviour.<br>
32 Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.<br>
1 Imitate God, therefore, in everything you do, because you are his dear children.<br>
2 Live a life filled with love, following the example of Christ. He loved us (and He loved you) and offered himself as a sacrifice for us, a pleasing aroma to God.<br>
3 Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God's people.<br>
4 Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes -- these are not for you. Instead, let there be thankfulness to God.<br>
5 You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is an idolater, worshipping the things of this world.<br>
6 Don't be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of God will fall on all who disobey him.<br>
7 Don't participate in the things these people do.<br>
8 For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light!<br>
9 For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true.<br>
10 Carefully determine what pleases the Lord.<br>
11 Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them.<br>

Hebrews 3:7 and reading non-stop into the next chapter, stopping at Hebrews 4:5 (KJV)<br>
3:7 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,<br>
3:8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:<br>
3:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.<br>
3:10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.<br>
3:11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)<br>
3:12 (If they shall enter into my rest,) Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.<br>
3:13 But exhort one another daily, whilst it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.<br>
3:14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;<br>
3:15 Whilst it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.<br>
3:16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.<br>
3:17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?<br>
3:18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?<br>
3:19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.<br>
4:1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.<br>
4:2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.<br>
(For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because they were not united by faith to them that heard it.)<br>
4:3 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.<br>
4:4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.<br>
4:5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.<br>

Hebrews 3:7 and reading non-stop into the next chapter, stopping at Hebrews 4:5 -- NLT<br>

That is why the Holy Spirit says,<br>
"Today when you hear his voice,<br>
8<br>
don't harden your hearts<br>
as Israel did when they rebelled,<br>
when they tested me in the wilderness.<br>
9<br>
There your ancestors tested and tried my patience,<br>
even though they saw my miracles for forty years.<br>
10<br>
So I was angry with them, and I said,<br>
'Their hearts always turn away from me.<br>
They refuse to do what I tell them.'<br>
11<br>
So in my anger I took an oath:<br>
'They will never enter my place of rest.'"<br>
(quoting from Psalms 95:7-11.)<br>
(Be careful then, dear brothers,)<br>
12<br>
Be careful then, dear brothers and sisters. Make sure that your own hearts are not evil and unbelieving, turning you away from the living God.<br>
13 You must warn each other every day, whilst it is still "today," so that none of you will be deceived by sin and hardened against God.<br>
14 For if we are faithful to the end, trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed, we will share in all that belongs to Christ.<br>
15<br>
Remember what it says (in Psalms 95:7-8):<br>
"Today when you hear his voice,<br>
don't harden your hearts<br>
as Israel did when they rebelled."<br>
<br>
16 And who was it who rebelled against God, even though they heard his voice? Wasn't it the people Moses led out of Egypt?<br>
17 And who made God angry for forty years? Wasn't it the people who sinned, whose corpses lay in the wilderness?<br>
18 And to whom was God speaking when he took an oath that they would never enter his rest? Wasn't it the people who disobeyed him?<br>
19 So we see that because of their unbelief they were not able to enter his rest.<br>
1 God's promise of entering his rest still stands, so we ought to tremble with fear that some of you might fail to experience it.<br>
2 For this good news -- that God has prepared this rest -- has been announced to us just as it was to them. But it did them no good because they didn't share the faith of those who listened to God.<br>
(it did them no good because they didn't combine what they heard with faith.)<br>
3 For only we who believe can enter his rest. As for the others, God said, (in Psalms 95:11)<br>
"In my anger I took an oath:<br>
'They will never enter my place of rest,'"<br>
even though this rest has been ready since he made the world.<br>
4 We know it is ready because of the place in the Scriptures (in Genesis 2:2) where it mentions the seventh day: "On the seventh day God rested from all his work."<br>
5 But in the other passage (repeating again the quote from Psalms 95:11) God said, "They will never enter my place of rest."<br>
<br>

Romans 2: 8-13 (KJV)<br>
2:8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,<br>
2:9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; (and also of the Greek;)<br>
2:10 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: (and also to the Greek:)<br>
2:11 For there is no respect of persons with God.<br>
2:12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;<br>
2:13 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.<br>
<br>
Romans 2: 8-13 NLT<br>
8 But he will pour out his anger and wrath on those who live for themselves, who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness.<br>
9 There will be trouble and calamity for everyone who keeps on doing what is evil -- for the Jew first and also for the Gentile.<br>
10 But there will be glory and honour and peace from God for all who do good -- for the Jew first and also for the Gentile (and also for the Greek).<br>
11 For God does not show favouritism.<br>
12 When the Gentiles sin, they will be destroyed, even though they never had God's written law. And the Jews, who do have God's law, will be judged by that law when they fail to obey it.<br>
13 For merely listening to the law doesn't make us right with God. It is obeying the law that makes us right in his sight.<br>

7:12 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.<br>
7:13 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.<br>
(neither shall any strengthen himself in his iniquity.)<br>
(For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, though their life were yet among the living: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself whose life is in his iniquity.)<br>
<br>
7:14 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.<br>
7:15 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.<br>

Ezekiel 7: 11-15 NLT<br>
...None of these proud and wicked people will survive.<br>
All their wealth and prestige will be swept away.<br>
12<br>
Yes, the time has come;<br>
the day is here!<br>
Buyers should not rejoice over bargains,<br>
nor sellers grieve over losses,<br>
for all of them will fall<br>
under my terrible anger.<br>
13<br>
Even if the merchants survive,<br>
they will never return to their business.<br>
For what God has said applies to everyone --<br>
it will not be changed!<br>
Not one person whose life is twisted by sin<br>
will ever recover.<br>
14<br>
"The trumpet calls Israel's army to mobilise,<br>
but no one listens,<br>

For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;<br>
<br>
Romans 1: 16-22 NLT<br>
16 For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes -- the Jew first and also the Gentile (and also the Greek).<br>
17 This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, "It is through faith that a righteous person has life."<br>
(referring to Habakkuk 2:4 where it says, The righteous will live by faith.)<br>
18 But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who suppress the truth by their wickedness.<br>
(God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who, by their wickedness, prevent the truth from being known.)<br>
19 They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them.<br>
20 For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities -- his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God.<br>
21 Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused.<br>
22 Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools.<br>

14 Likewise, all the leaders of the priests and the people became more and more unfaithful. They followed all the pagan practices of the surrounding nations, desecrating the Temple of the Lord that had been consecrated in Jerusalem.<br>
15 The Lord, the God of their ancestors, repeatedly sent his prophets to warn them, for he had compassion on his people and his Temple.<br>

1:9 In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.<br>
1:10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.<br>
1:11 Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.<br>
1:12 And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: (that are curded, or thickened on their lees:) that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.<br>
1:13 Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.<br>
1:14 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.<br>
1:15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,<br>
1:16 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.<br>
1:17 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.<br>
1:18 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD'S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.<br>
2:1 Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;<br>
2:2 Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD'S anger come upon you.<br>

on that day of the Lord's anger.<br>
For the whole land will be devoured<br>

He will make a terrifying end<br>
of all the people on earth.<br>
(He will make a terrifying end of the people living in the land.)<br>
1<br>
Gather together -- yes, gather together,<br>
you shameless nation.<br>
2<br>
Gather before judgement begins,<br>
before your time to repent is blown away like chaff.<br>
Act now, before the fierce fury of the Lord falls<br>
and the terrible day of the Lord's anger begins.<br>
3<br>
Seek the Lord, all who are humble,<br>
and follow his commands.<br>
Seek to do what is right<br>
and to live humbly.<br>
Perhaps even yet the Lord will protect you --<br>
protect you from his anger on that day of destruction.<br>

The Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah gave this Scripture to my wife at 8:00am on Friday, the 2nd day of July 2021.<br>
My wife wrote it down, using her own handwriting, on a yellow piece of lined notebook paper, and then we kept it posted on our doorframe, and then, later, on our electric refrigerator.<br>
It was originally just verse 1, verse 2 and verse 11 of Psalms 41.<br>
Let's read it, and enjoy a few adjacent verses whilst we are in the area.<br>
<br>
Psalms 41: verses 1 and 2, then verses 9 through 13 -- KJV<br>
41:1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.<br>
(Blessed is he that considereth the weak, Blessed is he that considereth the sick: the LORD will deliver him in the day of evil.)<br>
41:2 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.<br>
(and do not now deliver unto the will of his enemies.)<br>
(Yea, the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath magnified his heel against me.)<br>
41:9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.<br>
41:10 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.<br>
41:11 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.<br>
41:12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.<br>
41:13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 41: verses 1 and 2, then we skip down and finish with verses 9 through 13 -- NLT<br>
For the choir director: A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor!<br>
The Lord rescues them when they are in trouble.<br>
2<br>
The Lord protects them<br>
and keeps them alive.<br>
9<br>
Even my best friend, the one I trusted completely,<br>
the one who shared my food, has turned against me.<br>
10<br>
Lord, have mercy on me.<br>
Make me well again, so I can pay them back!<br>
11<br>
I know you are pleased with me,<br>
for you have not let my enemies triumph over me.<br>
12<br>
You have preserved my life because I am innocent;<br>
you have brought me into your presence forever.<br>
13<br>
Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,<br>
who lives from everlasting to everlasting.<br>
Amen and amen!<br>

1 Blessed is he who considers the poor; Yaw-Who-Wah does deliver him in a day of evil.<br>
2 Yaw-Who-Wah does guard him and keep him alive; He is blessed on the earth, And You do not hand him over To the desire of his enemies.<br>
9 Even my own friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me.<br>
10 But You, Yaw-Who-Wah, show me favour and raise me up, And let me repay them.<br>
11 By this I know that You did delight in me, Because my enemy does not shout for joy over me.<br>
12 And I, You uphold me in my integrity, And set me before Your face forever.<br>
13 Blessed be Yaw-Who-Wah ELL-Low-Heem of Israel (Yis-Rye-ELL) From everlasting to everlasting! Ah-Main and Ah-Main.<br>

2001 Targum Psalms English Translation by Edward M. Cook<br>
Because it is a paraphrased translation, the verse numbering is slightly different.<br>
Psalm 41<br>
1. For praise; a psalm of David.<br>
2. Happy the man who is wise to show mercy to the humble and poor on the day of evil; the Lord will deliver him.<br>
3. The Lord will keep him and preserve him and do well to him in the land; and he will not hand him over to the will of his enemies.<br>
10. Even a man who seeks my welfare, in whom I trusted, feeding him my meal -- he has cunningly prevailed over me.<br>
11. But you, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up from illness; and I will pay them back.<br>
12. By this I know that you have favoured me, that my enemy has not prevailed over me to cause harm.<br>
13. But I, for my blamelessness -- you have sustained me; and you made me stand in your presence forever.<br>
14. Blessed be the name of the Lord God of Israel, from this world to the world to come; the righteous will say, "Amen and amen."<br>

When the original books of the Bible were created, they did not have verse numbers, or chapter numbers, and the punctuation was later added as well.<br>
Translators decided where sentences would begin and end, and when chapters should begin and end.<br>
That's why I keep telling people to not always stop reading at the end of a chapter number, nor should you always start reading at the beginning of a chapter number.<br>
Just because someone decided to end a translated sentence at this spot here and start the next sentence over there, does not mean that they always did that correctly.<br>
We did not really start to see verse numbers until the mid-16th century, which is around in the 1550's.<br>
By the time we get to the year 1560, it became pretty-much a normal thing to see verse numbers.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, just for fun, watch what happens when we add just part of the next verse to Isaiah 1:18...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 1: 18 & 19 KJV<br>
1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br>
1:19 If ye be willing and obedient....<br>
<br>
(Isaiah) 1: 18 & 19 (TS2009)<br>
"Come now, and let us reason together," says Yaw-Who-Wah. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br>
19 "If you submit and obey....<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 1: 18 & 19 (NLT)<br>
"Come now, let's settle this," says the Lord. "Though your sins are like scarlet, I will make them as white as snow. Though they are red like crimson, I will make them as white as wool.<br>
19 If you will only obey me....<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 43:25 KJV<br>
43:25 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.<br>
<br>
(Isaiah) 43:25 (TS2009)<br>
"I, I am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and remember your sins no more.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 43:25 (NLT)<br>
"I -- yes, I alone -- will blot out your sins for my own sake and will never think of them again.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 6: part of verse 7 (NLT)<br>
...Now your guilt is removed, and your sins are forgiven."<br>
<br>
Matthew 9: part of verse 2 (NLT)<br>
...Seeing their faith, Jesus said..."Be encouraged, my child! Your sins are forgiven."<br>
<br>
In the NLT, in the New Testament, we get to hear Jesus say, Your sins are forgiven, in the following verses...<br>
Matthew 9:2 (we just looked at that one)<br>
Matthew 9:5<br>
Mark 2:5<br>
Mark 2:9<br>
Luke 5:20<br>
Luke 5:23<br>
Luke 7:48<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 2:12 (NLT)<br>
I am writing to you who are God's children because your sins have been forgiven through Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Is there forgiveness of sins in the Old Testament? Absolutely! We just saw a few examples in the Old Testament, in the book of Isaiah.<br>
We have studied many more examples in several of our previous Bible studies.<br>
<br>
One really big treasure trove of Old Testament sin forgiveness is Psalms 103.<br>
We have studied bits and pieces of Psalms 103 in previous studies.<br>
We read the first 8 verses during a random moment in Christian Essays 11, and we read verse 1 when we studied his Hebrew name in Christian Essays 20,<br>
and three verses from Psalms 103 landed in the top 500 list of the most popular and most quoted KJV bible verses, back in Chapter Zero, which is found on the Parallel Bible page.<br>
Let's now take a good look of all of Psalms 103, showing us forgiveness of sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 103, all 22 verses of Psalms 103 -- KJV<br>
<br>
103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.<br>
103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:<br>
103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;<br>
103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;<br>
103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.<br>
103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgement for all that are oppressed.<br>
103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.<br>
103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy (and great of mercy).<br>
103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.<br>
103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.<br>
103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.<br>
(For according to the height of the heaven above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.)<br>
103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.<br>
103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.<br>
103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.<br>
103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.<br>
(For the wind passeth over it, and it is not;)<br>
103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.<br>
103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;<br>
103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.<br>
103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.<br>
(Bless the LORD, ye his angels, mighty in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.)<br>
103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.<br>
103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.<br>
103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.<br>

<br>
Psalms 103, all 22 verses of Psalms 103 -- NLT<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
Let all that I am praise the Lord;<br>
with my whole heart, I will praise his holy name.<br>
2<br>
Let all that I am praise the Lord;<br>
may I never forget the good things he does for me.<br>
3<br>
He forgives all my sins<br>
and heals all my diseases.<br>
4<br>
He redeems me from death<br>
and crowns me with love and tender mercies.<br>
5<br>
He fills my life with good things.<br>
My youth is renewed like the eagle's!<br>
6<br>
The Lord gives righteousness<br>
and justice to all who are treated unfairly.<br>
7<br>
He revealed his character to Moses<br>
and his deeds to the people of Israel.<br>
8<br>
The Lord is compassionate and merciful,<br>
slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love.<br>
9<br>
He will not constantly accuse us,<br>
nor remain angry forever.<br>
10<br>
He does not punish us for all our sins;<br>
he does not deal harshly with us, as we deserve.<br>
11<br>
For his unfailing love toward those who fear him<br>
is as great as the height of the heavens above the earth.<br>
12<br>
He has removed our sins as far from us<br>
as the east is from the west.<br>
13<br>
The Lord is like a father to his children,<br>
tender and compassionate to those who fear him.<br>
14<br>
For he knows how weak we are;<br>
he remembers we are only dust.<br>
15<br>
Our days on earth are like grass;<br>
like wildflowers, we bloom and die.<br>
16<br>
The wind blows, and we are gone --<br>
as though we had never been here.<br>
17<br>
But the love of the Lord remains forever<br>
with those who fear him.<br>
His salvation extends to the children's children<br>
18<br>
of those who are faithful to his covenant,<br>
of those who obey his commandments!<br>
19<br>
The Lord has made the heavens his throne;<br>
from there he rules over everything.<br>
20<br>
Praise the Lord, you angels,<br>
you mighty ones who carry out his plans,<br>
listening for each of his commands.<br>
21<br>
Yes, praise the Lord, you armies of angels<br>
who serve him and do his will!<br>
22<br>
Praise the Lord, everything he has created,<br>
everything in all his kingdom.<br>
Let all that I am praise the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>

In August 2021, the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries<br>
defined the word, viscera, as<br>
the large organs inside your body, such as your heart, lungs, and stomach<br>
the internal organs of the body, especially those found in the abdominal cavity.<br>
the large organs inside the body, including the heart, stomach, lungs, and intestines<br>
Viscera are the large organs inside the body, such as the heart, liver, and stomach.<br>
the large organs inside the body, especially the intestines<br>
<br>
Another word that we will be reading here, in just a moment, is the word, Gehinnom.<br>
Gehenna and Gehinnom are two different words.<br>
Gehinnom is not found in the Bible, but is inserted in the Targum paraphrase-translation.<br>
In the English Translation of the Targumic Text for Psalms 103, the word, Gehinnom, is added in verse 4.<br>
It sounds like it is talking about Sheol, Hades, or Hell, or a place of that category, but, technically, it is not that, exactly.<br>
Gehinnom is basically referring to a place of death and destruction, where the wicked are sent.<br>
In Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, it has a webpage that tells us about the Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna).<br>
Today, the Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna) is a valley located in Jerusalem.<br>
On that Wikipedia webpage, in August 2021, it said this...<br>
"The ancient Aramaic paraphrase-translations of the Hebrew Bible known as Targums supply the term 'Gehinnom' frequently to verses touching upon resurrection, judgement, and the fate of the wicked. This may also include addition of the phrase 'second death', as in the final chapter of the Book of Isaiah, where the Hebrew version does not mention either Gehinnom or the Second Death, whereas the Targums add both. In this the Targums are parallel to the Gospel of Mark addition of 'Gehenna' to the quotation of the Isaiah verses describing the corpses 'where their worm does not die'."<br>
I just wanted you to have a little understanding about this added word that is not in the Bible, when you read it here in verse 4.<br>
<br>
Psalms 103, all 22 verses of Psalms 103 --  Targum.info -- English Translation of Targumic Texts:  Targum Psalms English Translation by Edward M. Cook<br>
Psalm 103<br>
1. Composed by David, spoken in prophecy. Bless, O my soul, the name of the Lord, and let all my viscera bless his holy name.<br>
<br>
2. Bless, O my soul, the name of the Lord, and do not forget all his nourishment, for he made breasts for your mother instead of insight.<br>
<br>
3. Who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases.<br>
<br>
4. Who redeems your life from Gehinnom, who crowned you with kindness and mercy.<br>
<br>
5. Who satisfies the days of your old age with goodness, and in the age to come, your youth will be renewed like the eagle of the canopy.<br>
(The exact translation of the Eagle of the canopy is uncertain.)<br>
6. The Lord does acts of righteousness, and judgements for all the oppressed.<br>
<br>
7. He revealed his ways to Moses, his deeds to the children of Israel.<br>
<br>
8. The Lord is merciful and compassionate; he loathes anger and does many deeds of goodness and truth.<br>
<br>
9. He will not quarrel always, nor will he retain hostility forever.<br>
<br>
10. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor has he repaid us according to our iniquities.<br>
<br>
11. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his goodness to those who fear him.<br>
<br>
12. As far as the east is from the west, thus far has he removed from us our transgressions.<br>
(As a father who pities the children,)<br>
13. As a father (Ah-Buh) who loves the children, so the Lord loves those who fear him.<br>
(For it is manifest in his presence our evil impulse that makes us go astray; in his presence it is remembered, for we are from dust.)<br>
14. For he knows our evil impulse that makes us sin; in his presence it is remembered, for we are from dust.<br>
<br>
15. The days of a son of man are like grass; like a blossom of the field, so will he bloom.<br>
<br>
16. For a storm-wind has blown on him and he is no more; and he no longer is aware of his place.<br>
<br>
17. But the favour of the Lord is upon those that fear him, from this age to the age to come; and his generosity is for the children of [their] children.<br>
<br>
18. For those who keep his covenant, and for those who remember his commandments to do them.<br>

Psalms 103, all 22 verses of Psalms 103 --  The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
1 Bless Yaw-Who-Wah, O my being, And all that is within me, Bless His set-apart Name!<br>
2 Bless Yaw-Who-Wah, O my being, And do not forget all His dealings,<br>
3 Who forgives all your crookednesses, Who heals all your diseases,<br>
4 Who redeems your life from destruction, Who crowns you with loving-commitment and compassion,<br>
5 Who satisfies your desire with the good, Your youth is renewed like the eagle's.<br>
6 Yaw-Who-Wah is doing righteousness And right-ruling for all the oppressed.<br>
7 He made known His ways to Moses (Moe-Shay), His acts to the children of Israel (Yis-Rye-ELL).<br>
8 Yaw-Who-Wah is compassionate and showing favour, Patient, and great in loving-commitment.<br>
9 He does not always strive, nor maintain it forever.<br>
10 He has not done to us according to our sins, Nor rewarded us according to our crookednesses.<br>
11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is His loving-commitment toward those who fear Him;<br>
12 As far as east is from west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us.<br>
13 As a father has compassion for his children, So Yaw-Who-Wah has compassion for those who fear Him.<br>
14 For He knows how we are made; He remembers that we are dust.<br>
15 A man's days are like grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.<br>
16 For the wind blows over it, and it is no more, And its place no longer remembers it.<br>
17 But the loving-commitment of Yaw-Who-Wah Is from everlasting to everlasting Upon those who fear Him, And His righteousness to children's children,<br>
18 To those who guard His covenant, And to those who remember His orders to do them.<br>

21 Bless Yaw-Who-Wah, all you His hosts, You His servants, who do His pleasure.<br>
22 Bless Yaw-Who-Wah, all His works, In all places of His rule. Bless Yaw-Who-Wah, O my being!<br>

...I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:<br>
2:5 According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.<br>
2:6 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;<br>
2:7 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
2:8 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
2:9 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
2:21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;<br>

<br>
Son of Man is a title that Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, used for himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's a little sample of Scripture taken from Daniel's Vision of Four Beasts...<br>
Daniel 7: 13 & 14 KJV<br>
7:13 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.<br>
7:14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 7: 13-18 then verses 23-28 -- NLT<br>
13 As my vision continued that night, I saw someone like a Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient One and was led into his presence.<br>
14 He was given authority, honour, and sovereignty over all the nations of the world, so that people of every race and nation and language would obey him. His rule is eternal -- it will never end. His kingdom will never be destroyed.<br>
15 I, Daniel, was troubled by all I had seen, and my visions terrified me.<br>
16 So I approached one of those standing beside the throne and asked him what it all meant. He explained it to me like this:<br>
17 "These four huge beasts represent four kingdoms that will arise from the earth.<br>
18 But in the end, the holy people of the Most High will be given the kingdom, and they will rule forever and ever."<br>
<br>
skipping down to verse 23, reading Daniel 7 verses 23 through 28, NLT...<br>
23 Then he said to me, "This fourth beast is the fourth world power that will rule the earth. It will be different from all the others. It will devour the whole world, trampling and crushing everything in its path.<br>
24 Its ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another king will arise, different from the other ten, who will subdue three of them.<br>
25 He will defy the Most High and oppress the holy people of the Most High. He will try to change their sacred festivals and laws, and they will be placed under his control for a time, times, and half a time.<br>
26 "But then the court will pass judgement, and all his power will be taken away and completely destroyed.<br>
27 Then the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will last forever, and all rulers will serve and obey him."<br>
28 That was the end of the vision. I, Daniel, was terrified by my thoughts and my face was pale with fear, but I kept these things to myself.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, Son of Man is a title that Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, used for himself.<br>
<br>
Luke 21: 31-36 KJV<br>
21:31 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.<br>
21:32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.<br>
21:33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.<br>
21:34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.<br>
21:35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.<br>
21:36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 21: 25-36 NLT<br>
25 "And there will be strange signs in the sun, moon, and stars. And here on earth the nations will be in turmoil, perplexed by the roaring seas and strange tides.<br>
26 People will be terrified at what they see coming upon the earth, for the powers in the heavens will be shaken.<br>
27 Then everyone will see the Son of Man coming on a cloud with power and great glory.<br>
(referring to Daniel 7:13)<br>
28 So when all these things begin to happen, stand and look up, for your salvation is near!"<br>
29 Then he gave them this illustration: "Notice the fig tree, or any other tree.<br>
30 When the leaves come out, you know without being told that summer is near.<br>
31 In the same way, when you see all these things taking place, you can know that the Kingdom of God is near.<br>
32 I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things have taken place.<br>
33 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.<br>
34 "Watch out! Don't let your hearts be dulled by carousing and drunkenness, and by the worries of this life. Don't let that day catch you unaware,<br>
35 like a trap. For that day will come upon everyone living on the earth.<br>
36 Keep alert at all times. And pray that you might be strong enough to escape these coming horrors and stand before the Son of Man."<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 21: 25-36 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
25 "And there shall be signs in the sun, and moon, and stars, and on the earth anxiety of nations, in bewilderment at the roaring of the sea, and agitation,<br>
26 men fainting from fear and the expectation of what is coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.<br>
(referring to what we read there in Haggai 2:6 as well as Haggai 2:21)<br>
<br>
27 "And then they shall see the Son of Ah-Dawm (Son of Adam, Son of Man) coming in a cloud with power and much esteem.<br>
(referring to Daniel 7:13)<br>
<br>
28 "And when these matters begin to take place, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near."<br>
29 And He spoke a parable to them, "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.<br>
30 "When they have already budded, observing it, you shall know for yourselves that summer is now near.<br>
31 "So you also, when you see these matters take place, know that the reign of ELL-Low-Heem is near.<br>
32 "Truly, I say to you, this generation shall by no means pass away till all shall have taken place.<br>
33 "The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.<br>
34 "And take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down by gluttony, and drunkenness, and worries of this life, and that day come on you suddenly.<br>
35 "For it shall come as a snare on all those dwelling on the face of all the earth.<br>
36 Watch then at all times, and pray that you be counted worthy to escape all this about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Ah-Dawm (Son of Adam, Son of Man)."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: In The Scriptures 2009 English translation, in Luke 21, at verse 28, it said, when these matters begin to take place.<br>
The matters and signs of the end times do not have to be happening everywhere for prophecy to become true.<br>
All we have to see is that they begin to take place somewhere.  Watch the news.  Keep a close eye on the news in Israel, in Jerusalem, in China, in Russia (the Bear that is supposed to come in from the north),  be a watchman and watch and see if any of these end-time matters begin to take place.  Is everyone believing in some kind of strong delusion, that they should believe a lie?<br>
You can't work here if you don't have this. You can't buy or sell if you don't have this, the genetically-merged-together pig and mouse being consumed together over there, right being wrong and wrong being right over in that land. Being forced to honour, worship and glorify a sin in a parade or protest. A food shortage in that land, a global currency being accepted and adopted over in that nation.<br>
If you start to see in the news, prophecy becoming true, even in just a certain geographic region, it has become true. Watch and be ready. Here He comes now! Ding dong, knock, knock, knock.<br>
<br>
Matthew 24:33 (NLT)<br>
In the same way, when you see all these things, you can know his return is very near, right at the door.<br>

In the same way, when you see all these things taking place, you can know that his return is very near, right at the door.<br>

The Hebrew word, Selah, appears as the word, Selah, in the KJV. The meaning of this word is uncertain, though it is probably a musical or literary term. It is rendered, Interlude, throughout the Psalms in the NLT.<br>
The word, Selah, or, Interlude, is just before Psalms 3:3.<br>
<br>
Psalms 3:3 KJV<br>
(But thou, O LORD, art a shield about me;)<br>
But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 3: 3-7 (NLT)<br>
3<br>
But you, O Lord, are a shield around me; you are my glory, the one who holds my head high.<br>
4<br>
I cried out to the Lord,<br>
and he answered me from his holy mountain.<br>
<br>
Interlude<br>
<br>
5<br>
I lay down and slept,<br>
yet I woke up in safety,<br>
for the Lord was watching over me.<br>
6<br>
I am not afraid of ten thousand enemies<br>
who surround me on every side.<br>
7<br>
Arise, O Lord!<br>
Rescue me, my God!....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 3: 1-7 (TS2009)<br>
1 O Yaw-Who-Wah, how my adversaries have increased! Many rising up against me.<br>
2 Many are saying of me, "There is no deliverance for him in ELL-Low-Heem." Selah.<br>
3 But You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, are a shield for me, My esteem, and the One lifting up my head.<br>
4 I cried to Yaw-Who-Wah with my voice, And He heard me from His set-apart mountain. Selah.<br>
5 I, I laid down and slept; I awoke, for Yaw-Who-Wah sustained me.<br>
6 I am not afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around.<br>
7 Arise, O Yaw-Who-Wah; Save me, O my ELL-Low-Heem!....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Romans) 10:9 (TS2009)<br>
That if you confess with your mouth the Master Yaw-Who-Shaw and believe in your heart that ELL-Low-Heem has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.<br>
<br>
(Philippians) 4:13 (TS2009)<br>
I have strength to do all, through Messiah who empowers me.<br>

John 20: 11-16 KJV<br>
20:11 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,<br>
20:12 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.<br>
20:13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.<br>
20:14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.<br>
20:15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.<br>
20:16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.<br>
<br>
John 20: 11-16 NLT<br>
11 Mary Magdalene was standing outside the tomb crying, and as she wept, she stooped and looked in.<br>
12 She saw two white-robed angels, one sitting at the head and the other at the foot of the place where the body of Jesus had been lying.<br>
13<br>
"Dear woman, why are you crying?" the angels asked her.<br>
"Because they have taken away my Lord," she replied, "and I don't know where they have put him."<br>
14 She turned to leave and saw someone standing there. It was Jesus, but she didn't recognise him.<br>
15<br>
"Dear woman, why are you crying?" Jesus asked her. "Who are you looking for?"<br>
She thought he was the gardener. "Sir," she said, "if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and get him."<br>
16<br>
"Mary!" Jesus said.<br>
She turned to him and cried out, "Rabboni!" (which is Hebrew for "Teacher").<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In the New Testament Original Hebrew to English Translation,<br>
the word, gardener, was originally the word, thief.<br>
Mary thought or assumed that she was talking to the thief that had removed or had stolen the body of Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
We will be trying to pronounce some Hebrew names in this next translation.<br>
Let's quickly review them before we start.<br>
Adon is the Hebrew word for 'Master.'<br>
Apparently, Mary likes to call every man, Master.<br>
Before she recognises Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, she calls him, Master, and then, when she finally recognises him, she still calls him, Master.<br>
Yeshua is Yaw-Who-Shaw, Jesus.<br>
Yeshua means, Salvation.<br>
Mashiach is a Hebrew word that is pronounced, Muh-Shee-Awck -- it means, Messiah, which is what Christ means.<br>
So, Jesus Christ is Jesus Messiah, which is Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck.<br>
Some people might say, Yeh-Shoe-Uh, Muh-Shee-Uck, which is what we see in the translation that we are about to read.<br>
Mary's name in Hebrew is Miryam.<br>
Angels are called, messengers.<br>
<br>
<br>

The Hebrew Gospels from Sepharad<br>
New Testament Original Hebrew to English Translation by the Van Rensburg family<br>
Version 1.1 -- April 2021<br>
A literal translation of a medieval Hebrew manuscript in the Vatican Library.<br>
<br>
John 20: 11-16 -- Hebrew to English Translation<br>
11 but Miryam stood outside the grave, weeping. So whilst she was weeping, she bent down and looked into the grave,<br>
(and she saw two messengers sitting at the place where the body of Jesus Messiah had been placed.)<br>
12 and she saw two messengers sitting, clothed with white -- one at the head, and one at the feet --<br>
at the place where the body of Yeshua Mashiach had been placed.<br>
13 And they said to that woman, "Why are you weeping?"<br>
So she said, "Because they have taken away my Adon (they have taken away my Master) from here, and I do not know where they have placed him."<br>
14 And when Miryam Magdalit had spoken these words, she turned about and saw (Jesus) Yeshua standing on his feet.<br>
And she did not realise that it was Yeshua,<br>
15 but she said in herself (she thought to herself) that he was the thief.<br>
So she said to him, "Adon, (master,) if you took him away, tell me where you have placed him that I may carry him away unto me."<br>
16 Then Yeshua said to her, "Miryam!" So she turned about and said to him, "Rabbi!"<br>
(So she turned about and said to him, Master!)<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
It feels like there may be some kind of argument or discussion about verse 16.<br>
Someone may have been trying to change what Mary said when she recognised Jesus.<br>
She kept saying, Master, but maybe someone wanted her to say something more special, like, Rabbi or Teacher, when she finally recognised him.<br>
<br>
The Greek translation called the assumed thief, a gardener.<br>
Later, we are going to talk about the famous, old song, In The Garden.<br>
It is inspired by this story that we have just looked at, here in John 20: 11-16.<br>
Maybe, they assumed there was a garden because the Greek translation used the word, Gardener, instead of, thief.<br>
What if the Greek translation got it wrong, and was supposed to be thief, instead of, gardener?<br>
Thief makes more sense. What if the beautiful song, In The Garden, in based on and inspired by a Greek translation mistake?<br>
What makes that song more important, is walking with him, following him, talking with him, praying to him, trusting him and obeying him.<br>
That is the more important part of that song, In The Garden.<br>
Walking with him in a garden sounds more pretty than walking with him in a battlefield, or a rubbish landfill, or a graveyard.<br>
Walking with him in a garden sounds more pretty and happy than walking with him through the valley of the shadow of death.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 5:7 KJV<br>

Ephesians 2: 9 & 10 NLT<br>
9 Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it.<br>

1 Peter 2: 21-23 KJV<br>
2:21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered (for you and) for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:<br>
2:22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:<br>
2:23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:<br>
(he threatened not; but committed his cause to him that judgeth righteously:)<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2: 21-25 NLT<br>
21<br>
For God called you to do good, even if it means suffering, just as Christ suffered for you.<br>
(Christ died for you.)<br>
He is your example, and you must follow in his steps.<br>
(we are told in Isaiah 53:9)<br>
22<br>
He never sinned,<br>
nor ever deceived anyone.<br>
23<br>
He did not retaliate when he was insulted,<br>
nor threaten revenge when he suffered.<br>
He left his case in the hands of God,<br>
who always judges fairly.<br>
24<br>
He personally carried our sins<br>
in his body on the cross<br>
so that we can be dead to sin<br>
and live for what is right.<br>
By his wounds<br>
you are healed.<br>

2:6 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:<br>
2:7 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.<br>
2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.<br>
(after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.)<br>
<br>
Colossians 2: 6-8 NLT<br>
6 And now, just as you accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord, you must continue to follow him.<br>
7 Let your roots grow down into him, and let your lives be built on him. Then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught, and you will overflow with thankfulness.<br>
8 Don't let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense that come from human thinking (and from the spiritual principles of this world,) and from the spiritual powers of this world, rather than from Christ.<br>

1 John 2: 3-7 KJV<br>
2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.<br>
2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.<br>
2:5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.<br>
2:6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.<br>
2:7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.<br>
<br>
Commentary: You have relationship and salvation in Jesus Christ if you keep his commandments.<br>
Which commandments? All of them.<br>
This includes the old commandments which is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.<br>
The beginning? That would be in Genesis, where it starts by saying, In the beginning.<br>
This spot right here in 1 John chapter 2 is letting you and me know that keeping the commandments goes all the way back to Genesis 1:1.<br>
All of the commandments includes all of the commandments in the Old Testament, all of the commandments in the New Testament, which all point right back to all of the commandments in the Old Testament.<br>
If you say, I know him, I know Jesus, and keepeth not his commandments, the Bible is calling you a liar, and the truth is not in you.<br>
If you try to keep the commandments, but you do not believe and receive Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw as your Messiah, your Master, your Lord and your Saviour, you are not saved by only obeying Torah without believing in the Messiah, because Messiah Jesus Yaw-Who-Shaw provides the salvation and forgiveness of your past commandment disobedience.<br>
You need the old covenant of commandment obedience, and you also need the new covenant of believing in Jesus as your Saviour, your Lord and your master.<br>
Those two covenants work together to give you and me eternal life, everlasting life in the kingdom of heaven.<br>
<br>
Again, if you say, I know him, I know Jesus, and keepeth not his commandments, the Bible is calling you a liar, and the truth is not in you.<br>
The way, the truth, the life, is not in you. The eternal life, the everlasting life is not in you, if you keepeth not his commandments.<br>
If you don't have the life in you, what is the opposite of life?<br>
When he is living in you, he fills you with his Holy Spirit which helps you easily obey all of his commandments.<br>
You wanting to obey his commandments is the proof that you are saved.<br>
We have studied this a few times before, even just recently again in Christian Essays 20.<br>
Here it is again, in the NLT...<br>
Ezekiel 36:25-27 NLT<br>
25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship idols.<br>
26 And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart (a heart of flesh.)<br>
27 And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.<br>
<br>
Verse 27 is the proof that you are saved. If he is in you, his spirit will cause you to obey his commandments successfully and faithfully.<br>
<br>
Lord means, Master.  Jesus is Lord.  Jesus is Master.  Yaw-Who-Shaw is Master, Pilot, Driver, Director, Supervisor and Good Shephard of your life.<br>
Is he? Is Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, your Master, your Lord? What is your answer?<br>
Is your answer wrong?  Better double-check what you wrote down there on your test.<br>
Better change that answer before your test gets turned in.<br>
Repent and change direction and make a U-Turn before you drive the wrong way any further.<br>
<br>
Psalms 26:2 KJV<br>
Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.<br>
<br>
Examine yourself.  The unexamined life is not worth living.<br>
You'd better check yourself before you wreck yourself, forever.<br>
(quoting from the Greek philosopher, Socrates, of all people, and then quoting a 1970's slogan from the Nationwide Safti-Break Centre which was later made famous in 1993 in Ice Cube's sexually-explicit rap song, Check Yo Self.)<br>
<br>
Read your entire Bible, Every day.<br>
Pray every day. Do your Bible, do what it says and obey it. Walk with him, following him.  Talk with him, as though you were talking to your friend, because he is your friend.<br>
Don't try to come up with your own philosophies, mental processes, your own understanding, or your own excuses as to why you think it's OK to disobey Torah, the Bible.<br>
Hell is an actual, real place.  Your Messiah said, it is finished, when he finished the work on the cross, which was the work that needed to be done so that you can go to Heaven, instead of Hell.<br>
Receive the free gift of eternal life, pray him in and let him enter into you, let him call your heart his home, and he will fill you with his Holy Spirit, and that will cause you to obey him and his Torah and his commandments.<br>
The desire for Commandment obedience is the proof that he is in you, it is the proof that you are saved, and that he is with you, walking with you through each day.<br>
He walks with you and he talks to you.  Follow, listen, trust, obey.  You are loved.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 2: 3-8 NLT<br>
3 And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.<br>
4 If someone claims, "I know God," but doesn't obey God's commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth.<br>
5 But those who obey God's word truly show how completely they love him. That is how we know we are living in him.<br>
6 Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.<br>
7 Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment for you; rather it is an old one you have had from the very beginning. This old commandment -- to love one another -- is the same message you heard before.<br>
8 Yet it is also new. Jesus lived the truth of this commandment, and you also are living it. For the darkness is disappearing, and the true light is already shining.<br>

Matthew 18:20 KJV<br>
For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 18:20 NLT<br>
(For where two or three gather together in my name, I am there among them.")<br>
20 For where two or three gather together as my followers, I am there among them."<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 24:13-15 KJV<br>
24:13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.<br>
24:14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.<br>
24:15 And it came to pass, that, whilst they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.<br>
<br>
(The distance from Jerusalem to the village of Emmaus is 60 stadia which is 11.1 kilometres, a distance of about seven miles.)<br>
<br>
Luke 24:13-15 NLT<br>
13 That same day two of Jesus' followers were walking to the village of Emmaus, seven miles from Jerusalem.<br>
14 As they walked along they were talking about everything that had happened.<br>
15 As they talked and discussed these things, Jesus himself suddenly came and began walking with them.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 10: 27 & 28 KJV<br>
10:27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:<br>
10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.<br>
<br>
(To help us study the differences in some manuscripts, we will read verse 27 and 28 two times right now in the NLT.)<br>
<br>
John 10: 27-30 NLT<br>
27 My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.<br>
28 I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me,<br>
(for what my Father has given me is more powerful than anything, for regarding that which my Father has given me, he is greater than all.)<br>
<br>
My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.<br>
I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me,<br>
29 for my Father has given them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else. No one can snatch them from the Father's hand.<br>
30 The Father and I are one."<br>

Micah 6:8 KJV<br>
6:8 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?<br>
(but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to humble thyself to walk with thy God?)<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 6:8 NLT<br>
...O people, the Lord has told you what is good,<br>
and this is what he requires of you:<br>
to do what is right, to love mercy,<br>
and to walk humbly with your God.<br>

1 John 1: 6-10 KJV<br>
1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:<br>
1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<br>
1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.<br>
1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.<br>
<br>
1 John 1: 6-10 NLT<br>
6 So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness; we are not practicing the truth.<br>
7 But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.<br>
8 If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth.<br>
9 But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.<br>
10 If we claim we have not sinned, we are calling God a liar and showing that his word has no place in our hearts.<br>

56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?<br>
<br>
Psalms 56: 10-13 NLT<br>
10<br>
I praise God for what he has promised;<br>
yes, I praise the Lord for what he has promised.<br>
11<br>
I trust in God, so why should I be afraid?<br>
What can mere mortals do to me?<br>
12<br>
I will fulfil my vows to you, O God,<br>
and will offer a sacrifice of thanks for your help.<br>
13<br>
For you have rescued me from death;<br>
you have kept my feet from slipping.<br>
So now I can walk in your presence, O God,<br>
in your life-giving light.<br>

<br>
Commentary:<br>
The preparation of the Yehudim (Yeh-Who-Deem, Jews) is a day before a Sabbath day of rest.<br>
It is the day before a day of rest, a prep-day, to prepare for the day of rest, so that no work needs to be done on the day of rest.<br>
A day of rest is a Sabbath, which, in Hebrew, is pronounced, Shuh-Bot.<br>
Shuh-Bot is spelled like this in the Hebrew to English Translation: S h a b b a t.<br>
Yeh-Who-Deem is spelled like this in the Hebrew to English Translation: Y e h u d i m.<br>
Yehudim (Yeh-Who-Deem) is the Hebrew name for 'Jews.'<br>
The preparation of the Yehudim is a "Shabbat evening,"<br>
which is the evening before the Sabbath, and in this case it was the<br>
evening before a feast day Sabbath, not the weekly Sabbath.<br>
The normal weekly Sabbath would start at sunset on Friday night, and would go into Saturday, until sunset on Saturday night.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even though we saw that difference earlier in the Hebrew to English Translation,<br>
it seems that there really was a garden nearby, so it is still OK if<br>
Mary thought He was a gardener, for there really was a garden near the grave.<br>
We were told earlier in John 19 that there was a garden near the grave.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 19: 41 & 42 -- Hebrew to English Translation<br>
41 And at the place where he had been hanged up, there was a garden. And there was a new grave in that garden; and no man had been placed in that grave.<br>
42 So because of the preparation of the Yehudim, (Yeh-Who-Deem, Jews) and because he was near that grave, they had placed Yeshua (Yaw-Who-Shaw) there.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 19: 41 & 42 -- KJV<br>
19:41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.<br>
19:42	There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 19: 41 & 42 -- NLT<br>
41 The place of crucifixion was near a garden, where there was a new tomb, never used before.<br>
(And so, because of the Jewish day of preparation)<br>
42 And so, because it was the day of preparation for the Jewish Passover and since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 19: 41 & 42 -- TS2009<br>
41 And at the place where He was impaled there was a garden, and in the garden a fresh tomb in which no one had yet been laid.<br>
42 There, then, because of the Preparation Day of the Yeh-Who-Deem, they laid Yaw-Who-Shaw, because the tomb was near.<br>

Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia, has a webpage, titled, In the Garden (1912 song).<br>
This song is special to my family.  My wife has a flowery, garden-like glitter-globe.<br>
It's like a snow globe, but with glitter instead, depicting a colourful garden with flowers, butterflies and such.<br>
When you wind-up the music box underneath, it plays the hymn or gospel song known as, In the Garden.<br>
My wife sang that song to our daughter ever since our daughter was a little baby.<br>
<br>
Here are some selected quotes from that Wikipedia webpage, as it was back in August of 2021.<br>
The page also provided the song's lyrics, which we will look at here, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
In the Garden was written by Charles Austin Miles.<br>
He wrote at least 398 songs.<br>
His best-known song would likely be this one, "In the Garden" (1912).<br>
This song has been included in over 210 hymnal books.<br>
<br>
"In the Garden"<br>
(sometimes rendered by its first line "I Come to the Garden Alone")<br>
is a gospel song written by American songwriter, C. Austin Miles, known also as Charles Austin Miles (1868-1946).<br>
He was a former pharmacist who served as editor and manager at Hall-Mack publishers for 37 years.<br>
According to Miles' great-granddaughter, the song was written "in a cold, dreary and leaky basement in Pitman, New Jersey that didn't even have a window in it let alone a view of a garden."<br>
The song was first published in 1912 and was popularised during the Billy Sunday evangelistic campaigns of the early twentieth century by two members of his staff, Homer Rodeheaver and Virginia Asher.<br>
<br>
There are many Recorded versions.<br>
Some of the early recordings include the following examples...<br>
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans recorded "In the Garden" with a vocal quartet and orchestra on 3 March 1950.<br>
Tennessee Ernie Ford performed the song on his 1956 platinum album, Hymns.<br>
On 18 June 1958 a recording by Perry Como was made as part of his album, When You Come to the End of the Day.<br>
Rosemary Clooney, who was in the 1954 film, White Christmas, included it on her 1959 MGM Records album, Hymns from the Heart.<br>
Doris Day recorded the song on her 1962 album, You'll Never Walk Alone.<br>
Elvis Presley recorded the song on his gospel album, How Great Thou Art (1967).<br>
Willie Nelson recorded the song on his 1976 gospel album, The Troublemaker.<br>
The Statler Brothers' 1981 version reached #35 on the US Country chart.<br>
Glen Campbell recorded the song on his 1989 gospel album, Favourite Hymns.<br>
American country music singer-songwriter Johnny Cash was born in 1932, and he passed away in September of 2003.<br>
Two months after Cash's death, a 5-CD box set was released, titled, Cash Unearthed, and it featured for the first time, his recording of the song, In the Garden, on disc 4, which has the disc title, My Mother's Hymn Book.<br>
<br>
The song is also heard in the films,<br>
Wild River, a 1960 film starring Montgomery Clift,<br>
Nashville, a 1975 American satirical musical ensemble comedy-drama film,<br>
and in, Places in the Heart, a 1984 film starring Sally Field, about a young woman during the Great Depression in Texas.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 1912 gospel song, In the Garden, by C. Austin Miles.<br>
<br>
I come to the garden alone,<br>
While the dew is still on the roses;<br>
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,<br>
The Son of God discloses.<br>
<br>
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,<br>
And He tells me I am His own,<br>
And the joy we share as we tarry there,<br>
None other has ever known.<br>
<br>
He speaks, and the sound of His voice<br>
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing;<br>
And the melody that He gave to me<br>
Within my heart is ringing.<br>
<br>
I'd stay in the garden with Him<br>
Though the night around me be falling;<br>
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe,<br>
His voice to me is calling.<br>
<br>
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,<br>
And He tells me I am His own,<br>
And the joy we share as we tarry there,<br>
None other has ever known.<br>
<br>
