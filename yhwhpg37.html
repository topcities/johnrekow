Did Goliath have any brothers? Yes, he did. Goliath and his brothers can be found here:<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 21:18-22 (NIV):<br>
"In the course of time, there was a war with the Philistines at Gob. At that time, Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of the giants. In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod. In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He also was descended from the giants. When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him. These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men."<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 20:4-8 (NIV):<br>
"In the course of the war against the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath, who was from Gath. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's rod. In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha. When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him. These were the descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
These passages indicate that Goliath had brothers who were also giants, specifically mentioning that Lahmi was a brother of Goliath. The term "descendants of Rapha" refers to the giants, which implies that Goliath and his brothers were part of this lineage.<br>
<br>
<br>
The identification of the individuals mentioned in the passages as brothers of Goliath is based on the context and wording used in the biblical texts. Here's how the connections are made:<br>
<br>
Contextual Clues:<br>
In both 2 Samuel 21:18-22 and 1 Chronicles 20:4-8, the narrative discusses battles involving the Philistines and mentions Goliath specifically. The passages refer to other giants who are described as being from Gath, the same city as Goliath, and they are noted as descendants of Rapha, which is a term often associated with giants.<br>
<br>
Direct Mention:<br>
In 1 Chronicles 20:4, it explicitly states that Elhanan killed "Lahmi the brother of Goliath." This direct mention establishes a familial relationship.<br>
<br>
Similar Descriptions:<br>
The other giants mentioned in these passages are described in ways that align with the characteristics of Goliath, such as their size and lineage. This suggests they are part of the same family or group of giants.<br>
<br>
Repetition of Themes:<br>
The mention of multiple giants in the context of battles against Israel, along with the specific reference to Goliath's brother, reinforces the idea that these individuals are related.<br>
<br>
Whilst the texts do not provide a detailed family tree, the combination of these contextual clues and direct references leads to the conclusion that the giants mentioned in these passages are indeed brothers or close relatives of Goliath.<br>
<br>
<br>
Based on these biblical accounts, here is a list of Goliath and his four brothers:<br>
<br>
1. Goliath - The most well-known giant, defeated by David.<br>
2. Lahmi - Specifically mentioned as the brother of Goliath in 1 Chronicles 20:4.<br>
3. Saph - Mentioned in 2 Samuel 21:18 as one of the giants killed by David's men.<br>
4. Ishbi-Benob - Also mentioned in 2 Samuel 21:16 as a giant who sought to kill David.<br>
5. Another unnamed giant - Described in 2 Samuel 21:20 as a giant with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, who was also a descendant of the giants.<br>
<br>
These names and descriptions are derived from the passages in 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles, which discuss the battles with the Philistines and the giants associated with Goliath.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible, the verse that describes David selecting smooth stones before fighting Goliath is found in 1 Samuel 17:40. Here is the verse:<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 17:40 (KJV):<br>
("And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the valley, and put them in a shepherd's vessell which he had,)<br>
"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Perhaps David chose five smooth stones before facing Goliath, because Goliath had four brothers, which would be a total of five giants known to be in the region.<br>
<br>
The reason David chose five smooth stones before facing Goliath is not explicitly stated in the biblical text, so interpretations vary. Some scholars and commentators suggest that David may have selected five stones in anticipation of facing not only Goliath but also his brothers, as there are references to multiple giants associated with Goliath.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, David only needed one stone to defeat Goliath, which emphasises his faith in God rather than reliance on physical weapons.<br>
<br>
We only need one stone to defeat our enemy, and that stone is our chief cornerstone, the head stone of the corner, our firm foundation, the rock that travelled with them, standing in the shadow of a great rock in a weary land, the solid rock on which I stand. Who set me up upon a rock?<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:5 -- KJV<br>
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27: 4 & 5 -- NLT<br>
4<br>
The one thing I ask of the Lord --<br>
the thing I seek most --<br>
is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,<br>
delighting in the Lord's perfections<br>
and meditating in his Temple.<br>
5<br>
For he will conceal me there when troubles come;<br>
he will hide me in his sanctuary.<br>
He will place me out of reach on a high rock.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 32:2 -- KJV<br>
And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 62:1 -- KJV<br>
Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 31:3 -- KJV<br>
For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 95:1 -- KJV<br>
O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 18:2 -- KJV<br>
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.<br>

<br>
There was a 1967 song that became very popular in 1969.<br>
It was called, "Oh Happy Day."<br>
The original version was first released in 1755,<br>
coming from clergyman Philip Doddridge. That 1755 hymn was then put to music<br>
that was originally released in 1704 by Johann Anastasius Freylinghausen (1670 - 1739).<br>
<br>
The melody was then modified in 1854 by Edward Rimbault,<br>
and his version had the title, O Happy Day, That Fixed My Choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
The exact year Philip Doddridge wrote the hymn "Oh, Happy Day"<br>
is not definitively documented.<br>
However, it is believed that he composed the text<br>
in the early 18th century, likely around the 1730s.<br>
<br>
<br>
The hymn "Oh, Happy Day" is often attributed to Philip Doddridge,<br>
but it was actually published posthumously.<br>
Doddridge wrote the text of the hymn,<br>
but it was not released until after his death in 1751.<br>
The hymn was included in a collection of his works that was published in 1755.<br>
<br>
So, whilst Doddridge did not release the hymn himself,<br>
his work was compiled and published by others after his passing.<br>
<br>
<br>
To summarise this again,<br>
The original 1755 lyrics were published four years after the death of English Nonconformist, Congregationalist, minister, educator, and hymnwriter, Philip Doddridge (1702 - 1751).<br>
It may have been written sometime during the 1730s, but the exact year is unknown.<br>
The added 1854 lyrics were by British organist, musicologist, book collector and author Edward Rimbault (1816 - 1876),<br>
and the popular 1967 arrangement and lyrics were created by American gospel musician, pianist, vocalist, choir master, composer, and arranger Edwin Hawkins (1943 - 2018).<br>
<br>
<br>
Edwin Hawkins was one of the originators of the urban contemporary gospel sound.<br>
As the leader of the Edwin Hawkins Singers, he was probably best known for his 1967 arrangement of "Oh Happy Day."<br>
<br>
<br>
The song is based on the story found in the Book of Acts 8:26-40.<br>
<br>
Here is a short summary of this story found in Acts 8:26-40.<br>
<br>
The angel of the Lord instructs Philip to travel south to Gaza. There, he encounters an Ethiopian eunuch, a high official reading the book of Isaiah. Philip approaches him and asks if he understands what he is reading. The eunuch invites Philip to explain, leading to a discussion about Jesus. As they travel, they come across water, and the eunuch requests baptism.<br>
<br>
Philip baptises him, and suddenly, the Spirit of the Lord takes Philip away.<br>
<br>
The eunuch continues his journey rejoicing, whilst Philip suddenly finds himself in Azotus, preaching the gospel in various towns until he reaches Caesarea.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dorothy Combs Morrison is an American gospel music singer.<br>
She sang the lead vocal on the song "Oh Happy Day" recorded in 1967 by the Edwin Hawkins Singers.<br>
The 1967 recording was made at the Ephesian Church of God in Christ, in Berkeley, California.<br>
The 1967 recording was first released outside of the United States in 1968.<br>
After it was eventually released in the United States, in April of 1969, it became one of the most popular songs of 1969.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, the song was also known as, "O Happy Day That Fixed My Choice" when it was released in 1854.<br>
<br>
Here are now the words to the song, Oh Happy Day.<br>
This reading will include the<br>
1755 lyrics written by Philip Doddridge,<br>
the added 1854 lyrics by Edward Rimbault,<br>
and the 1967 lyrics added by Edwin Hawkins, and made famous by Dorothy Morrison and The Edwin Hawkins Singers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
O happy day, that fixed my choice<br>
On thee, my Saviour and my God!<br>
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,<br>
And tell its raptures all abroad.<br>
<br>
<br>
O happy bond,<br>
that seals my vows To Him<br>
Who merits all my love!<br>
Let cheerful anthems fill His house,<br>
While to that sacred shrine I move.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
'Tis done, the great transaction's done:<br>
I am my Lord's, and he is mine;<br>
He drew me, and I followed on,<br>
Charmed to confess the voice divine.<br>
<br>
<br>
'Tis done -- the great transaction's done;<br>
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;<br>
He drew me and I followed on,<br>
Rejoiced to own the call divine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now rest, my long-divided heart;<br>
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest,<br>
Nor ever from thy Lord depart;<br>
With him of every good possessed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now rest, my long-divided heart,<br>
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest;<br>
Here have I found a nobler part;<br>
Here heav'nly pleasures fill my breast.<br>
<br>
<br>
High heav'n, that heard the solemn vow,<br>
That vow renewed shall daily hear,<br>
Till in life's latest hour I bow,<br>
And bless in death a bond so dear.<br>
<br>

Commentary:<br>
The Sharon Plain is a region in the coastal plain of Palestine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Song of Solomon - Song of Songs 2:1 -- KJV<br>
I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.<br>
<br>
<br>
Song of Solomon - Song of Songs 2:1 -- NLT<br>
(I am the rose of Sharon.)<br>
I am the spring crocus blooming on the Sharon Plain,<br>
the lily of the valley.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Song of Solomon - Song of Songs 2:1 -- TS2009<br>
I am the rose of Sharon, The lily of the valleys.<br>
<br>
<br>
Song of Solomon - Song of Songs 2:1 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
I am the rose of the field, and the lily of the valleys.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In the Geneva Bible margin notes, it says that,<br>
The Church defines the rest of the book (of the Song of Solomon - Song of Songs)<br>
as being under the shadow of Christ.<br>
She heareth his voice.<br>
She is compared to the dove, and the enemies to the foxes.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Isaiah's Prayer for Zion and Jerusalem...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 62:4 -- NLT<br>
Never again will you be called "The Forsaken City"<br>
or "The Desolate Land."<br>
<br>
(Never again will you be called "forsaken"<br>
or "desolate.")<br>
<br>
(Never again will you be called "Azubah"<br>
or "Shemamah.")<br>
<br>
<br>
Your new name will be "The City of God's Delight"<br>
and "The Bride of God,"<br>
<br>
(Your new name will be "My Delight Is In Her"<br>
and "Married,")<br>
<br>
(Your new name will be "Hephzibah"<br>
and "Beulah,")<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: The land will be called, Beulah, according to Isaiah 62:4.<br>
In the song that we will be looking at next,<br>
there is a mention about going sightseeing in Beulah, one of the new names for Zion and Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes, in the English language, the greeting,<br>
"How do you do?" from the 16th century,<br>
eventually became "Howdy-do" in the 19th century,<br>
which eventually was shortened to "Howdy"<br>
and became popular in the American West.<br>
"Howdy" is an informal way of saying "Hello."<br>
<br>
<br>
As of July of 2025, that song, Oh Happy Day<br>
by The Edwin Hawkins Singers<br>
was the number two best-selling gospel song of all time.<br>
<br>
What is the number one<br>
best-selling gospel song of all time?<br>
<br>
It is a 1947 recording by Mahalia Jackson.<br>
The song is titled, Move On Up a Little Higher.<br>
<br>
It was released as a single, in the form of a 10-inch phonographic record<br>
that spun at 78 revolutions per minute (78 RPM).<br>
<br>
The maximum recording time was typically around 3 to 4 minutes per side,<br>
which is why the recording has a brief, silent moment, as Side A ended,<br>
and then the song continued on Side B.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mahalia Jackson (1911 - 1972).<br>
She was an American gospel singer,<br>
widely considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century.<br>
With a career spanning 40 years, Jackson was integral to the development and spread<br>
of gospel blues in black churches throughout the United States.<br>
<br>
"Move On Up a Little Higher" is a gospel song written by W. Herbert Brewster,<br>
first recorded by Brother John Sellers in late 1946,<br>
and then most famously recorded on 12 September 1947,<br>
by gospel singer Mahalia Jackson,<br>
whose version sold eight million copies and<br>
as of July of 2025, it still is the number one best-selling gospel song of all time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the original 1947 song, Move On Up a Little Higher,<br>
by Mahalia Jackson.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One of these mornings<br>
One a-these mornings<br>
I'm gonna lay down my cross<br>
Get my crown<br>
<br>
<br>
One of these evenings, good Lord<br>
Late one evening, O Lord<br>
Late one evening<br>
I'm going home<br>
to live on high<br>
<br>
<br>
God, as Soon as my feet strike Zion<br>
Lay down my heavy burden<br>
Put on my robe, Lord, in glory, Lord<br>
Sing out, and tell my story<br>
<br>
<br>
Come over hills and mountains, Lord<br>
Up to the Christian fountain<br>
<br>
All of God's sons and daughters, Lord<br>
Drinkin' that ole healing water<br>
<br>
We're gonna live on forever<br>
Yes, I'm gonna live on forever<br>
Yes, I'm gonna live up, up in glory after awhile<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm goin out sightseeing in Beulah, Lord<br>
March all around God's altar<br>
Walk, never tired<br>
Fly, Lord, and never falter<br>
<br>
<br>
Move on up a little higher<br>
Meet with ol' man Daniel<br>
Move on up a little higher, Lord<br>
Meet my good mamma<br>
Move on up a little higher, Lord<br>
Meet that Lilly of the Valley<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast with the Rose of Sharon<br>
It will be always, "Howdy Howdy!"<br>
It will be always, "Howdy Howdy!"<br>
It will be always, "Howdy Howdy," Lord<br>
And never goodbye.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, will you be there?<br>
Tell me, will you be there?<br>
Some sunny, sunny morning<br>
Will you be there<br>
Helping the angels share of the Lord<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, children, I'll be waiting<br>
I'm going home too<br>
Yes, I'll be watching, early one day, wondering<br>
Yes, I'll be waiting, Lord, at the beautiful<br>
Golden Gates<br>
<br>
<br>
Soon as my feet strike Zion<br>
Lay down my heavy burdens, Lord<br>
Put on my robe, Lord, in Glory<br>
Sing loud, and Lord, and tell my story<br>
<br>
<br>
Climb over hills, Lord, and mountains, Lord<br>
Come to the Christian fountain<br>
All of God's sons and daughters, Lord<br>
