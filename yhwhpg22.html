Galatians 2:20 KJV<br>
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<br>
<br>
Galatians 2:20 (NLT)<br>
My old self has been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So I live in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: At the Last Supper, we are told by Jesus to do communion, which is also known by other names, including, breaking of bread, and the Lord's Supper. We have looked at this in some previous Bible studies, here.<br>
We have looked at this when we studied what the original Christian church did, as the original example of a simple Christian Church Service, back in Christian Essays 1, the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 1.<br>
We have also studied some additional Bible content on this topic when we recently did our study, titled, Old Covenant, New Covenant, which was in Christian Essays 21, the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 21.<br>
Let's take a look at some additional, bonus material in the Bible that gives us some further insight behind the value, the importance, and the meaning of communion.  We will begin by remembering the Last Supper, as reported to us by Luke, in the book of Luke, Chapter 22.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 22:13-20 KJV<br>
13 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.<br>
14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.<br>
15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:<br>
16 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<br>
17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:<br>
18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.<br>
19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.<br>
20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 22:13-20 NLT<br>
13 They went off to the city and found everything just as Jesus had said, and they prepared the Passover meal there.<br>
14 When the time came, Jesus and the apostles sat down together at the table (and reclined together).<br>
15 Jesus said, "I have been very eager to eat this Passover meal with you before my suffering begins.<br>
16 For I tell you now that I won't eat this meal again until its meaning is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God."<br>
17 Then he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. Then he said, "Take this and share it among yourselves.<br>
18 For I will not drink wine again until the Kingdom of God has come."<br>
19 He took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."<br>
20 After supper he took another cup of wine and said, "This cup is the new covenant between God and his people -- an agreement confirmed with my blood, which is poured out as a sacrifice for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's now fast-forward two chapters, to the book of Luke, chapter 24.<br>
After this part that we just looked at, The Last Supper, the book of Luke tells us that<br>
Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw Predicts Peter's Denial,<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw Prays on the Mount of Olives,<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw Is Betrayed and Arrested,<br>
Peter Denies Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw stands before the Council,<br>
We then have the Trial before Pilate, then there's<br>
The Crucifixion, The Death of Yaw-Who-Shaw<br>
The Burial, and The Resurrection of Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
And now, let's continue reading here...<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 24: 13-49 KJV<br>
13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.<br>
14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.<br>
15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.<br>
16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.<br>
17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?<br>
18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?<br>
19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:<br>
20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.<br>
21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.<br>
22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;<br>
23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.<br>
24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.<br>
25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:<br>
26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?<br>
27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<br>
28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.<br>
29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.<br>
30 And it came to pass, as he sat at the table with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<br>
31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.<br>
32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?<br>
33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,<br>
34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.<br>
35 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.<br>
36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.<br>
37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.<br>
38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?<br>
39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.<br>
40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.<br>
41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?<br>
42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.<br>
43 And he took it, and did eat before them.<br>
44 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.<br>
45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,<br>
46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:<br>
47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<br>
48 And ye are witnesses of these things.<br>
49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you....<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 24: 13-49 NLT<br>
13 That same day two of Jesus' followers were walking to the village of Emmaus, seven miles from Jerusalem.<br>
(which is a distance of 60 stadia, or, 11.1 kilometres.)<br>
<br>
14 As they walked along they were talking about everything that had happened.<br>
15 As they talked and discussed these things, Jesus himself suddenly came and began walking with them.<br>
16 But God kept them from recognising him.<br>
17<br>
He asked them, "What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?"<br>
They stopped short, sadness written across their faces.<br>
18<br>
Then one of them, Cleopas, replied, "You must be the only person in Jerusalem who hasn't heard about all the things that have happened there the last few days."<br>
19<br>
"What things?" Jesus asked.<br>
"The things that happened to Jesus, the man from Nazareth," they said. "He was a prophet who did powerful miracles, and he was a mighty teacher in the eyes of God and all the people.<br>
20 But our leading priests and other religious leaders handed him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified him.<br>
21 We had hoped he was the Messiah who had come to rescue Israel. This all happened three days ago.<br>
22 "Then some women from our group of his followers were at his tomb early this morning, and they came back with an amazing report.<br>
23 They said his body was missing, and they had seen angels who told them Jesus is alive!<br>
24 Some of our men ran out to see, and sure enough, his body was gone, just as the women had said."<br>
25 Then Jesus said to them, "You foolish people! You find it so hard to believe all that the prophets wrote in the Scriptures.<br>
26 Wasn't it clearly predicted that the Messiah would have to suffer all these things before entering his glory?"<br>
27 Then Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.<br>
28 By this time they were nearing Emmaus and the end of their journey. Jesus acted as if he were going on,<br>
29 but they begged him, "Stay the night with us, since it is getting late." So he went home with them.<br>
<br>
30 (As they reclined,) As they sat down to eat, he took the bread and blessed it. Then he broke it and gave it to them.<br>
<br>
31 Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And at that moment he disappeared!<br>
32 They said to each other, "Didn't our hearts burn within us as he talked with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us?"<br>
33 And within the hour they were on their way back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples and the others who had gathered with them,<br>
<br>
34 who said, "The Lord has really risen! He appeared to Peter (Simon)."<br>
<br>
35 Then the two from Emmaus told their story of how Jesus had appeared to them as they were walking along the road, and how they had recognised him as he was breaking the bread.<br>
36 And just as they were telling about it, Jesus himself was suddenly standing there among them. "Peace be with you," he said.<br>
37 But the whole group was startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost!<br>
38 "Why are you frightened?" he asked. "Why are your hearts filled with doubt?<br>
39 Look at my hands. Look at my feet. You can see that it's really me. Touch me and make sure that I am not a ghost, because ghosts don't have bodies, as you see that I do."<br>
40 As he spoke, he showed them his hands and his feet.<br>
41 Still they stood there in disbelief, filled with joy and wonder. Then he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"<br>
42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish,<br>
43 and he ate it as they watched.<br>
44 Then he said, "When I was with you before, I told you that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must be fulfilled."<br>
45 Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.<br>
46 And he said, "Yes, it was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer and die and rise from the dead on the third day.<br>
<br>
47 It was also written that this message would be proclaimed in the authority of his name (to all peoples,) to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem: 'There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.'<br>
<br>
48 You are witnesses of all these things.<br>
49 "And now I will send the Holy Spirit, just as my Father promised....<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6: 29-35 KJV<br>
29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.<br>
30 They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?<br>
31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.<br>
32 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.<br>
33 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.<br>
34 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.<br>
35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6: 29-35 NLT<br>
29 Jesus told them, "This is the only work God wants from you: Believe in the one he has sent."<br>
30 They answered, "Show us a miraculous sign if you want us to believe in you. What can you do?<br>
31 After all, our ancestors ate manna while they journeyed through the wilderness! The Scriptures say, 'Moses gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"<br>
(referring to Exodus 16:4; and Psalms 78:24.)<br>
<br>
32 Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, Moses didn't give you bread from heaven. My Father did. And now he offers you the true bread from heaven.<br>
33 The true bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."<br>
34 "Sir," they said, "give us that bread every day."<br>
35 Jesus replied, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again. Whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6: 47-59 KJV<br>
47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.<br>
48 I am that bread of life.<br>
49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.<br>
50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.<br>
51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.<br>
52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?<br>
53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.<br>
54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.<br>
55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.<br>
56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.<br>
57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.<br>
58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.<br>
59 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6: 47-59 NLT<br>
47 "I tell you the truth, anyone who believes has eternal life.<br>
48 Yes, I am the bread of life!<br>
49 Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness, but they all died.<br>
50 Anyone who eats the bread from heaven, however, will never die.<br>
51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever; and this bread, which I will offer so the world may live, is my flesh."<br>
52 Then the people began arguing with each other about what he meant. "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" they asked.<br>
53 So Jesus said again, "I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you cannot have eternal life within you.<br>
54 But anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise that person at the last day.<br>
55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.<br>
56 Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.<br>
57 I live because of the living Father who sent me; in the same way, anyone who feeds on me will live because of me.<br>
58 I am the true bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will not die as your ancestors did (even though they ate the manna) but will live forever."<br>
59 He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 17:11 (KJV)<br>
For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.<br>
<br>
Leviticus 17:11 (NLT)<br>
for the life of the body is in its blood. I have given you the blood on the altar to purify you, making you right with the Lord (to make atonement for you). It is the blood, given in exchange for a life, that makes purification possible.<br>

Commentary: As we now bring this Bible study to its conclusion, we still have one final verse to think about, which is a verse we have studied before, in the study of our best, role-model example of a correctly-done, simple Christian Church Service, back in Christian Essays 1, the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 1.<br>
It is, Acts 2:42, and we will look at that verse again in just a moment.<br>
We mention, in that study, that we are told that we are to do communion often, and in remembrance of Jesus and what he did to save us from our sins. However, technically, the Bible does not clearly and directly tell us to do this often.  It's indicated that we are to think about it, remember it, and appreciate its worth and value, as often as we eat and drink of this Lord's Supper.  This mention about it being done often, is extracted from something we recently studied, when we recently did our study, titled, Old Covenant, New Covenant, which was in Christian Essays 21, the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 21.  In that study, we were looking at 1 Corinthians 11:23-32.<br>
Here is the part from that study that indicates it is to be done often...
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11: 25 & 26 KJV<br>
25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.<br>
26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11: 25 & 26 NLT<br>
25 In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant between God and his people -- an agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it."<br>
26 For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There could be some discussion and debate on how to interpret these verses here that mention the word, often.<br>
<br>
One way would be to think about or even do communion as often as you eat or drink, which could be, perhaps three times a day, every day.  However, the wording about, often, could also be interpreted as being as often as you do the Passover meal, which is once every year.  Luke clearly indicated that the last supper was a Passover meal. So, we could also say, as often as you do the Passover meal, make sure you examine yourself, and give the Passover meal its proper worth and value by doing communion during the Passover meal.  But, once a year does not sound like, often.  I'd like to remember and appreciate what Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, did for you and me a little more often than once a year.  So, how can we say to do it often?<br>
<br>
The way how we can say that it should be done often, is to look at our example of what they did in the Bible's demonstration of a properly-done Christian Church Service.  They did communion every time they met from house to house. They did communion every time they met and gathered together, be it once a week, or maybe twice a week, or maybe even three times a week, and during the seven feasts of the Lord that we are commanded to do, when the scriptures, the Bible, the Torah, instructs us and commands us to gather together for a solemn assembly, when you study and do the seven feasts or festivals of the Lord. When they gathered together and assembled together, they did communion.  Now that sounds like often.  As often as they met, they did communion.  That is our example that teaches us that we are to do this often, remembering the work of the new covenant that he finished on the cross, so that our sins would go into remission, so that we can have forgiveness, mercy, grace and the free gift of eternal life, in heaven forever with our Heavenly Father, our king, our God, our saviour, who loves us, and who gave himself for us, the one who sits on the throne forever and ever, our friend.<br>
<br>
Here is the verse where, often, is demonstrated.<br>
<br>
Acts 2:42 (KJV)<br>
And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.<br>
<br>
Acts of the Apostles 2:42 (NLT)<br>
All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, and to fellowship, and to sharing in meals (including the Lord's Supper), and to prayer.<br>

Commentary:  There is an interesting verse that I wanted to share with you in 2 Samuel 14.<br>
The story surrounding this verse is very long and dramatic and does contain some adult content.<br>
Basically, King David, a man after God's own heart, is not perfect, and does commit a terrible sin.<br>
He lusts after another man's wife, he commits adultery with her, then arranges to have the husband killed in battle.<br>
With the husband dead, he then marries the woman and she becomes another one of David's many wives.<br>
He thinks he got away with it, but the Lord sees it all happen, and so, Nathan Rebukes David.<br>
David Confesses His Guilt, but his family is then cursed with sin that includes sexual immorality, and incest, along with an evil spirit of rebellion and lawlessness.<br>
David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar.<br>
Amnon, her half brother, lusts after her and eventually rapes her.<br>
Two years later, Absalom gets Revenge on Amnon for doing that, and kills him.<br>
Absalom fled to his grandfather, and He stayed there in Geshur for three years.<br>
In 2 Samuel 14, Joab realised how much the king longed to see Absalom.<br>
So he sent for a woman from Tekoa who had a reputation for great wisdom.<br>
She tells a story that makes King David reconsider his relationship with Absalom.<br>
Seeing the similarities that are in her story, he asks her, Did Joab put you up to this?<br>
And she says, Yes, Joab sent me and told me what to say.<br>
All right, Joab, go and bring back the young man Absalom.<br>
So, Absalom is Reconciled to David, but the drama continues on with<br>
Absalom starting up a great Rebellion that threatens the life of King David, and so<br>
David Escapes from Jerusalem, and the story and the drama goes on from there.<br>
All of that family stress, trauma and drama was all part of a curse brought into the family from David's initial sin of adultery and murder.<br>
When that wise woman from Tekoa tells that story, she just happens to say a very interesting verse that I wanted to share with you here.<br>
It's so interesting, that I want to show you how it was translated into English, by comparing it in several English translations.<br>

2 Samuel 14:14 (GNV)<br>
For we must needs die, and we are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again: neither doeth God spare any person, yet doeth he appoint means, not to cast out from him, him that is expelled.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 14:14 KJV<br>
<br>
(For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; because God hath not taken away his life, he hath also devised means, that his banished be not expelled from him.)<br>
<br>
14 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 14:14 (NIV)<br>
Like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die. But that is not what God desires; rather, he devises ways so that a banished person does not remain banished from him.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 14:14 (NASB 1995)<br>
For we will surely die and are like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away life, but plans ways so that the banished one will not be cast out from him.<br>
<br>
<br>
II Samuel 14:14 (NKJV)<br>
For we will surely die and become like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away a life; but He devises means, so that His banished ones are not expelled from Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
(2 Samuel) 14:14 (TS2009)<br>
"For we shall certainly die and become like water spilled on the ground, which is not gathered up again. Yet EE-Low-Heem does not take away a life, but shall devise ways, so that His outcast ones are not cast out from Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 14:14 (NLT)<br>
All of us must die eventually. Our lives are like water spilled out on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not just sweep life away; instead, he devises ways to bring us back when we have been separated from him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  As you read through your entire Bible, you learn that the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, your Heavenly Father, loves you and that your life is very valuable and precious to him, but it is very short and temporary here on this earth.  Even though your sins have separated you from him, and can eventually send you to hell, death and destruction, he does not want you to die and go to hell.  And so, Yaw-Who-Wah has devised a way to bring you back to him, to heal and restore your relationship with him, so that you will be forgiven, and that you will not die and can be with him forever in the kingdom of Heaven. Jesus Christ, our Yaw-Who-Shaw, our Messiah, is the way, the truth and the eternal life that he devised for you and for me.  This verse is not only is a reflection of the Gospel, the Good News, it also gives us a glimpse as to why Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, did and finished that work that he did for us on the cross, and then died and was then risen from the grave. Yaw-Who-Shaw is the way and is the only devised means of how we, the previously banished sinner children of God, are not expelled and cast out from him, and that we have a way and a means of being brought back into the perfect relationship with the Heavenly Father, so that we can be forgiven, and loved forever by him in his Kingdom of Heaven.<br>
<br>
If you want to activate and apply this devised means for yourself, just say out loud that you believe that Yaw-Who-Shaw is EE-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah, that you believe that Jesus Christ is the Lord God, and that Yaw-Who-Wah raised up Yaw-Who-Shaw from the grave. Read your entire Bible and pray, every single day, and let him direct you and pilot you.  He will help you change direction, he will heal you, transform you and remodel you, then he will enter into you, live in you, he will make your healed heart his forever home, and he will fill you with his Holy Spirit, and this Spirit that is Holy, this Haw-Coh-Desh Roo-Awk, Roo-Awk, Haw-Coh-Desh, will give you the power and the ability to obey his Torah, his commandments and his sabbaths and his seven feasts, and you will be healed and saved and forgiven, soon to be living in heaven with him forever and ever, Amen, Ah-Main.  Believe.  Trust and Obey.<br>

John 20: verse 30, 31 and Chapter 21, verse 1 -- KJV<br>
30 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:<br>
31 but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.<br>
1 After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.<br>

<br>
John 20: verse 30, 31 and Chapter 21, verse 1 -- NLT<br>
30 The disciples saw Jesus do many other miraculous signs in addition to the ones recorded in this book.<br>
31 But these are written (so that you may believe, and) so that you may continue to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing in him you will have life by the power of his name.<br>

13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.<br>
14 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:<br>
15 and I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.<br>

17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.<br>
18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.<br>

Christian Essays 19, which is also known as,<br>
The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 19,<br>
When we did the Bible study, titled, Jumping Jehoshaphat and False Prophets.<br>
Let's add the last three verses of the previous chapter.<br>
We'll start in chapter 3, read verses 15, 16 and 17, the last three verses of chapter 3,<br>
and then keep on reading right into chapter 4, stopping at verse 5.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 3: verse 15, through 2 Timothy 4: verse 5 -- KJV<br>
...thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br>
16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:<br>
17 that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.<br>
1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;<br>
2 preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<br>
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;<br>
4 and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.<br>
5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 3: verse 15, through 2 Timothy 4: verse 5 -- NLT<br>
...the holy Scriptures...have given you the wisdom to receive the salvation that comes by trusting in Christ Jesus.<br>
16 All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realise what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.<br>
17 God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work.<br>
1 I solemnly urge you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus, who will someday judge the living and the dead when he comes to set up his Kingdom:<br>
2 Preach the word of God. Be prepared, whether the time is favourable or not. Patiently correct, rebuke, and encourage your people with good teaching.<br>
3 For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching. They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear.<br>
4 They will reject the truth and chase after myths.<br>
5 But you should keep a clear mind in every situation. Don't be afraid of suffering for the Lord. Work at telling others the Good News, and fully carry out the ministry God has given you.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 3: verse 15, through 2 Timothy 4: verses 1 and 2 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
...you have known the Set-apart Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for deliverance through belief in Messiah Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
16 All Scripture is breathed out by Elohim and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for setting straight, for instruction in righteousness,<br>
17 that the man of Elohim might be fitted, equipped for every good work.<br>
1 In the sight of Elohim and the Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah, who shall judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His reign, I earnestly charge you:<br>
2 Proclaim the Word! Be urgent in season, out of season. Convict, (confute, prove them wrong,) warn, appeal, with all patience and teaching.<br>
<br>
By taking a quick look at the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins, and Oxford Dictionaries,<br>
we can combine what they all say, and say that the overall dictionary definition for the word, confute, is...<br>
to prove that a person or an argument is completely wrong or false;<br>
to prove (a person, an argument, or a theory) to be wrong, invalid, or mistaken.<br>

Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep your's also.<br>
<br>
John 15:20 (NLT)<br>
Do you remember what I told you? 'A slave is not greater than the master.' Since they persecuted me, naturally they will persecute you. And if they had listened to me, they would listen to you.<br>

Commentary: Our master, our teacher, Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, teaches us all things, and is the author, finisher and perfecter of our faith. His good, pleasing and perfect will does a perfecting work, making us become perfect, perfectly perfecting us perfectly, because our father and master Yaw-Who-Wah is perfect, and his word, his Torah is perfect.  When we are fully trained, getting it all down perfectly, in the teachings of Yaw-Who-Shaw, we will become more like Yaw-Who-Shaw. Here are verses that talk about him, being perfect, and how he perfectly perfects us, making us become perfect, which is what we will be when we arrive in the Kingdom of Heaven.<br>

<br>
<br>
When we read the English Bibles, we read, in English<br>
the name, Jesus Christ.<br>
Jesus would be his name and Christ is his title.<br>
Jesus Christ, with his name first, and his title second,<br>
is found 71 times in the New Testament.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are many places in the Bible where his title comes before his name.<br>
It would be like this,<br>
Christ Jesus<br>
With his title before his name, we can count and see that,<br>
The name, Christ Jesus occurs 91 times in the New Testament.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is common to put a title in front of someone's name...<br>
Christ Jesus<br>
King David<br>
Queen Elisabeth<br>
Fireman Sam<br>
Doctor McCoy<br>
Captain Kangaroo<br>
General Patton<br>
President Trump<br>
<br>
<br>
This Greek title of Christ, which means, Messiah,<br>
appears 569 times in the Bible.<br>
The Greek that gets translated into the English word, Christ,<br>
the original Greek word,<br>
in the ancient Greek, it would have been pronounced, Chris-Toss.<br>
In today's Greek, it may sound like, Chris-Toes<br>
The R in the first syllable is slightly rolled.<br>
The rolling of the R in Chris-Toss, or today, Chris-Toes,<br>
is not something that we can demonstrate here within the<br>
text of the English language.<br>
The Hebrew word for Messiah, pronounced, Muh-Shee-Uck.<br>
As we mentioned in Christian Essays 20, the Bible's Greatest Hits,<br>
Chapter 20.<br>
Muh-Shee-Uck is the Hebrew way of pronouncing what became the English word, Messiah.<br>
A Christ, a Messiah is an anointed king who comes to rescue, to deliver and save his people.<br>
Jesus Christ is our Messiah, our saviour, our anointed king who saves us from sin and death.<br>
The Greek word for Jesus is pronounced,<br>
Yee-Suh-Seeg-Mah<br>
It is the Greek form of Joshua, which, in Hebrew is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw<br>
Jesus means, Jaw-Who-Wah is Salvation<br>
<br>
The Greek word for Christ, Chris-Toss, or, Chris-Toes,<br>
it also means, anointed.<br>
What is, anointed?<br>
<br>
Let's find out. First of all, Anointed is the past tense of Anoint. The following details describe what is done to a person or object to make them be anointed. The descriptions that we are about to look at, describe the general actions and rituals that are done to anoint that person or object. After the ceremonial actions or rituals have been performed or officially applied to the person or object, that person or object is then declared to be anointed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Grabbing again, combined word definitions from, the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins, and Oxford Dictionaries,<br>
anointed, means,<br>
chosen officially to do an important job<br>
to choose someone to do a particular job, usually by a person in authority:<br>
to smear with oil,<br>
to put oil or ointment on (someone's head, feet, etc), usually as part of a religious ceremony.<br>
An anointed person would be (of a person) made holy in a religious ceremony that involves putting holy water or oil on them,<br>
formally named as king or queen, especially as part of a ceremony,<br>
anoint somebody/something (with something)<br>
Continuing our look at these dictionary definitions, to anoint someone or something, so that they are anointed, to anoint would be, to put oil or water on somebody's head or body as part of a religious ceremony.<br>
If a person in a position of authority anoints someone, they choose them to do a particular important job.<br>
to anoint would also be, to smear or rub over with oil or an oily liquid,<br>
to apply oil to someone or something as a sign of consecration or sanctification in a sacred rite,<br>
the action of anointing someone would be, to make someone holy in a religious ceremony by putting holy water or oil on them,<br>
to make someone king or queen, especially as part of a religious ceremony.<br>

Through the blessings and burdens this life will bring<br>
In You alone I'm satisfied<br>

my fears<br>
And believing<br>

No matter what my future holds<br>
You are God, You are in control<br>
And this will be my, this will be my prayer<br>
<br>
Let Your song be the song I sing<br>
Through the blessings and burdens this life will bring<br>
In You alone I'm satisfied<br>
And all I need is Your sacrifice<br>

No matter the cost<br>
I'll take up my cross<br>
And run to you<br>
Run to you<br>

Lamentations 3: 20-26 NLT<br>
20<br>
I will never forget this awful time,<br>
as I grieve over my loss.<br>
21<br>
Yet I still dare to hope<br>
when I remember this:<br>
<br>
(The faithful love of the Lord keeps us from destruction.)<br>
<br>
22<br>
The faithful love of the Lord never ends!<br>
His mercies never cease.<br>
23<br>
Great is his faithfulness;<br>
his mercies begin afresh each morning.<br>
24<br>
I say to myself, "The Lord is my inheritance;<br>
therefore, I will hope in him!"<br>
25<br>
The Lord is good to those who depend on him,<br>
to those who search for him.<br>
26<br>
So it is good to wait quietly<br>
for salvation from the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lamentations 3: 21-26 KJV<br>
21<br>
This I recall to my mind,<br>
Therefore have I hope.<br>
22<br>
It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed,<br>
Because his compassions fail not.<br>
23<br>
They are new every morning:<br>
Great is thy faithfulness.<br>
24<br>
The LORD is my portion, saith my soul;<br>
Therefore will I hope in him.<br>
25<br>
The LORD is good unto them that wait for him,<br>
To the soul that seeketh him.<br>
26<br>
It is good that a man should both hope and quietly<br>
Wait for the salvation of the LORD.<br>

Great Is Thy Faithfulness is a popular Christian hymn<br>
written by Thomas Chisholm in Baldwin City, Kansas.<br>
Thomas Chisholm was born in 1866, and he passed away in 1960.<br>
The title and lyrics refer to the KJV of Lamentations 3: 23 & 24.<br>
Thomas Chisholm wrote the poem in 1923, when he was 57 years old.<br>
He also wrote several prominent Christian hymns,<br>
and over 1,200 sacred poems over his lifetime,<br>
which appeared in many Christian magazines.<br>
<br>
The hymn's music was composed by William M. Runyan (1870–1957).<br>
<br>
Billy Graham used this hymn frequently on his international crusades.<br>
<br>
In 2019, the copyright expired as the song entered the public domain in the United States.<br>
<br>
<br>
With the music written by William M. Runyan,<br>
Here are the words to the 1923 hymn, Great Is Thy Faithfulness,<br>
by Thomas Chisholm.<br>
<br>
<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father<br>
There is no shadow of turning with Thee<br>
Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not<br>
As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be<br>
<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness<br>
Morning by morning new mercies I see<br>
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me<br>

Sun, moon and stars in their courses above<br>
Join with all nature in manifold witness<br>
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love<br>

Great is Thy faithfulness<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness<br>
Morning by morning new mercies I see<br>
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me<br>

Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide<br>
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow<br>
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside<br>

As you may know, the first five books of the Old Testament, the books of the Law of Moses, the original Torah,<br>
is also know as the Pent-Uh-Hue, which is spelled like this: Pentateuch<br>
Penta means, 5, as in a Pentagon having 5 sides.<br>
The first five books of the Old Testament, the Pentateuch, and many of the other Old Testament books have one or more Targum translations.<br>
The process is generally thought of like this.  Many centuries ago, someone memorises an Old Testament book completely.<br>
And then, from memory, they copy it into another language.<br>
Like many ancient translations, there can be an occasional bit of extra commentary, and expanded amounts of explanation placed into the translation.<br>
Although this extended and additional, extra bit of content can be very interesting to consider and study,<br>
technically, that additional content is not in the original Hebrew Torah.<br>
Sometimes, the translation is referred to as a paraphrased work being translated into another language.<br>
So, in summary, you can generally think of the Targums as a memorised, but paraphrased, recollection of the Hebrew Torah,<br>
translated from Hebrew, to another language, and then translated again into English.<br>
Because it is a paraphrased recollection of Torah, being recalled from one's memory as they create the translation, it has expanded descriptions, expanded explanations, and some commentaries,<br>
all included in the recalled-from-memory, paraphrased translation.<br>
<br>
It is like a way of tapping into some of the ancient Torah commentaries and explanations that were commonly taught and understood many centuies ago.<br>
<br>
In the attempt to possibly gain a more deeper understanding, we will be reading some material from a Targum paraphrased translation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's start with a selected portion from<br>
Leviticus, Chapter 23, starting in verse 11 as it is published in<br>
The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan Ben Uzziel<br>
On the Pentateuch With The Fragments of the Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee<br>
by J. W. Etheridge, M.A.<br>
First Published in the year, 1862.<br>
The English words in round brackets were changed to be the common English words that an English audience would easily understand.<br>
<br>
And the Lord spake with (Moses), saying: Speak with the sons of Israel, and say to them:<br>
When you have entered into the land which I give you, and you reap the harvest,<br>
you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest;<br>
and he shall uplift the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you.<br>
After the first festival day of (Passover) (or, the day after the feast-day of Passover)<br>
on the day on which you elevate the sheaf, you shall make (the sacrifice of a lamb of the year,<br>
unblemished a burnt offering unto the Name of the Lord: and its mincha, two tenths of flour, mingled with olive oil,<br>
for an oblation to the Name of the Lord, to be received with acceptance; and its libation, wine of grapes,<br>
the fourth of a hin. But neither bread nor parched corn (of the ripe harvest)<br>
nor new ears may you eat until this day, until the time of your bringing the oblation of your God:<br>
an everlasting statute unto your generations in all your dwellings<br>
<br>
<br>
Let talk about how to calculate,<br>
Feast 3 of 7.<br>
To calculate this date for Feast 3 of 7, we start with the day of Passover, also known as First day of Passover (Day 1).<br>
Starting with the day after Passover Day 1, the next day, you wait until the day after the next Sabbath Saturday, which will land on a Sunday.<br>
That next Sunday is Feast 3 of 7.  The Sunday feast actually starts at sunset on the previous Saturday night.<br>
To summarise this again,<br>
1. You start with the day after a Passover.<br>
2. You wait until after the next Saturday comes and goes.<br>
3. On that next Saturday, at sunset, is the start of Feast 3 of 7, that continues on into that Sunday, ending on that Sunday sunset.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If Passover starts on sunset of a Saturday, then that means that the Passover is on a Sunday, and so you wait until the day after the following Saturday, at the end of the next week, and then on that following Saturday at sunset is the start of Feast 3 of 7.<br>
If Passover starts on sunset of a Friday, then that means that Passover is on a Saturday Sabbath, and so that Saturday evening, at sunset, Feast 2 of 7 starts.<br>
But, the counting does not yet start for Feast 3 of 7.  In order for the Sunday to qualify for Feast 3 of 7...<br>
1. Passover must come and go first.<br>
2. The next Saturday must come and go, and at sunset on that next Saturday is Feast 3 of 7.<br>
<br>
However, before Feast 3 of 7 starts, on that very next day, on Sunday.<br>
Again, you wait until the day after Passover Day 1, and then wait until the following Saturday at sunset to start Feast 3 of 7 which continues into Sunday, until Sunday sunset.<br>
<br>
If Passover starts on a Thursday, then Friday is Feast 2 of 7, Day 1 of 7, then after Friday is Saturday, and then at sunset on that Saturday is the start of Feast 3 of 7.<br>
Note how, Feast 2 of 7, Day 3 of 7 AND Feast 3 of 7 both land on that same Sunday, in this example.<br>
Again, if Passover lands on Thursday, then Feast 2 starts on Friday, which is a 7 day long feast.<br>
So, on that Sunday, it is Feast 2 of 7, Day 3 of 7, AND ALSO it is Feast 3 of 7.<br>
So there can be some Sundays where one is celebrating Feasts 2 and 3 at the same time, on a Sunday.<br>
<br>
Feast 3 of 7 is also known as<br>
Celebration of First Harvest -- First Fruits<br>
First Fruits -- Yom Rishon -- Yom habikkurim -- Reshit Katzir<br>
<br>
The instructions for Feast 3 of 7, are in Leviticus 23, verses 9-14 and the wording can be very unclear and difficult to interpret.<br>
<br>
The basic way to remember Leviticus 23:11 is to just say that, Feast 3 is on the day after the first Sabbath, after Passover.<br>
<br>
<br>
If Feast 1 Passover starts on Friday at sunset, then Feast 1 is on Saturday.<br>
On that Passover Saturday at sunset,  Feast 2 of 7 starts, but Feast 3 of 7 can't start yet, because it needs to pass through the next Saturday first, before Feast 3 can officially begin at sunset on Saturday.<br>
Feast 2 of 7 lasts for 7 days, so it keeps going, but Feast 3 of 7 only lasts for one day.<br>
That's why Feast 3 can land somewhere inside the week-long Feast 2, depending on which day of the week that the Passover started.<br>
<br>
<br>
Shaa-Voo-Waa is the Hebrew word that means, Festival of Weeks.<br>
At the start and the end of that word, there is a long A sound, like in the word, lap, or lab, or bad.<br>
The Waa at the end is like how a baby cries, Waaaaaa.<br>
Again, the Hebrew word, Shaa-Voo-Waa is the Hebrew word that means, Festival of Weeks, which is the next feast, Feast 4 of 7.<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast 3 of 7 is NOT a Sabbath. I repeat, Feast 3 of 7 is NOT a Sabbath.<br>
<br>
Some people confuse Numbers 28:26 to be talking about Feast 3, but it has a phrase in there that points to Feast 4.<br>
Unfortunately, one of my favourite English translations, the New Living Translation (NLT) (1996, 2004, 2007, 2015) leaves out that additional necessary phrase.<br>
<br>
Observe the failure in the NLT...<br>
Numbers 28:26 (NLT)<br>
"At the Festival of Harvest, when you present the first of your new grain to the Lord, you must call an official day for holy assembly, and you may do no ordinary work on that day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The important extra phrase that points to Feast 4 can be seen in other translations...<br>
<br>
(Numbers) 28:26 (TS2009) -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (1993, 2009, 2015)<br>
And on the day of the first-fruits, when you bring a new grain offering to Yaw-Who-Wah at your Festival of Shaa-Voo-Waa (Festival of Weeks), you have a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work.<br>
<br>
Even though there is now a 2020 edition of the New American Standard Bible (NASB), when we choose to occasionally quote the NASB, we will be quoting from the previous, 1995 edition, unless we specifically say otherwise.<br>
<br>
Numbers 28:26 (NASB1995) New American Standard Bible (NASB) (1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1977, 1995)<br>
'Also on the day of the first fruits, when you present a new grain offering to the Lord in your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work.<br>
<br>
Numbers 28:26 (NIV)<br>
" 'On the day of firstfruits, when you present to the Lord an offering of new grain during the Festival of Weeks, hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.<br>
<br>
Numbers 28:26 (GNV) -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
Also in the day of your first fruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the Lord, according to your weeks ye shall have an holy convocation, and ye shall do no servile work in it:<br>
<br>
Numbers 28:26 (KJV) -- King James Version (KJV) (1611)<br>
Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:<br>
<br>
KJV says, "after your weeks be out."<br>
refers to Festival of Weeks<br>
Feast 4 of 7.<br>
The Festival of Harvest, Festival of Weeks, Festival of Pentecost<br>
Feast 4 of 7 is Shavuot (or Shabuoth) -- pronounced, Shaa-Voo-Waa<br>
Feast 4 is a Sabbath, a day of complete rest. Do Not Work on this day.<br>

In a moment, we will be reading some scripture from a book that is not in the Bible.<br>
Strong evidence indicates that the Book of Enoch used to be one of the books in the Bible at one time.<br>
There are even areas in the Bible today that refer to this book, and even quote text directly out of this book.<br>
The Book of Jude, a book in your Bible right now, is one example of your Bible giving you a quote directly out of the Book of Enoch.<br>
The translation and publication we will be looking at is,<br>
THE BOOK OF ENOCH:<br>
TRANSLATED FROM THE ETHIOPIC, WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES.<br>
BY REV. GEORGE H. SCHODDE, PH. D.<br>
PROFESSOR IN CAPITAL UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO.<br>
1882 English Translation.<br>
Every quote from the Book of Enoch in this study today is being quoted from that 1882 publication.<br>
We will read out of the Book of Enoch here, in just a moment.<br>
I'm sure the notes in that publication are very insightful, but we will just be looking at the verses only.<br>
Please note that, later in the Book of Enoch, the chapter numbering may be off by one,<br>
depending on which source or which English translation you are using to read the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
Let's look at some interesting verses that can be used for calculating the Seven Feasts.<br>
The studies, the commentaries, and the teachings and discussions on how to use these verses can go on and on for hours.<br>
We will just read the verses here, for you to study and consider, and then you can do your own further research if you wish.<br>
Here are some Bible verses that people like to use when calculating the dates for the Seven Feasts of the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
Genesis 1:14 (KJV)<br>
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:<br>
<br>
Genesis 1:14 (NLT)<br>
Then God said, "Let lights appear in the sky to separate the day from the night. Let them be signs to mark the seasons, days, and years.<br>
<br>
Psalms 104:19 (KJV)<br>
He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down.<br>
<br>
Psalms 104:19 (NLT)<br>
You made the moon to mark the seasons, and the sun knows when to set.<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23: 4-6 KJV<br>
4 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.<br>
5 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's passover.<br>
6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23: 4-6 NLT<br>
4 "In addition to the Sabbath, these are the Lord's appointed festivals, the official days for holy assembly that are to be celebrated at their proper times each year.<br>
(This day, The Lord's Passover, in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May.)<br>
5 "The Lord's Passover begins at sundown on the fourteenth day of the first month.<br>
6 On the next day, the fifteenth day of the month, you must begin celebrating the Festival of Unleavened Bread. This festival to the Lord continues for seven days, and during that time the bread you eat must be made without yeast.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Ecclesiasticus Sirach is not in the Bible today, but it was in the King James Version when it was first released.<br>
Here is a quote from that book.<br>
The book of Ecclesiasticus Sirach, chapter 43, verses 6 through 8.<br>
from the Revised Standard Version 1977 with Apocrypha.<br>
<br>
Attention. The Greek text of this first verse, here in verse 6, is uncertain.<br>
<br>
6<br>
He made the moon also, to serve in its season<br>
to mark the times and to be an everlasting sign.<br>
7<br>
From the moon comes the sign for feast days,<br>
a light that wanes when it has reached the full.<br>
8<br>
The month is named for the moon,<br>
increasing marvellously in its phases,<br>
an instrument of the hosts on high<br>
shining forth in the firmament of heaven.<br>

Enoch 74: 1-3<br>
CHAP. 74. -- <br>
1. And I saw another course and law for her, making her monthly course according to that law.<br>
2. And Uriel, the holy angel, who is the leader of them all, showed me all things, and I wrote down all their positions as he showed them to me, and I wrote down their months as they were and the appearance of their lights till fifteen days are completed.<br>
3. And in seven single parts she completes all her light in the east, and in seven single parts she completes all her darkness in the west.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 74:5<br>
5. And in two the moon sets with the sun, in those two portals which are in the middle, in the third and in the fourth portal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 73:1-3<br>
CHAP. 73. --<br>
1. And after this law I saw another law with reference to the smaller luminary whose name is moon.<br>
2. And her circuit is like the circuit of the heavens, and her chariot in which she rides is driven by the wind, and in a measure light is given to her.<br>
3. Every month her ascent and her descent is changed; her days are like the days of the sun, and when her light is equal (and when her light is full,) her light is the seventh part of the light of the sun.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 77: 15 & 16<br>
CHAP. 77. --<br>
Due to the chapter numbering difference in different English translations that we mentioned earlier, we find the quoted verse in the next chapter.<br>
CHAP. 78. --  verse 15 and 16<br>
15. And three months she makes thirty days in her time, and three months she makes each time twenty-nine days, in which she makes her decrease, in the first time and in the first portal for one hundred and seventy-seven days. <br>
16. And in the time of her departure she is seen each time thirty days during three months, and each time twenty-nine days during three months.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Light vanishes from the moon = month at an end. <br>
Enoch is 100% equating the month to the cycle of the moon, as well as confirming the exit of light from the moon is equivalent to the month ending.<br>
<br>
Enoch 79: 1-8 -- we are targeting verses 1, 2, and 3, but we will keep reading to verse 8.<br>
Due to the chapter numbering difference in different English translations that we mentioned earlier, we find these verses in the next chapter.<br>
CHAP. 80. --<br>
1. And in those days Uriel answered and said to me: "Behold, I have showed thee all things, O Enoch, and have revealed to thee that thou shouldst see this sun and this moon, and those who lead the stars of heaven and all those that revolve, their deeds and their times and their departures.<br>
2. And in the days of the sinners the years will be shortened, and their seed will be tardy on their lands and on their meadows, and everything on the earth will change and will not appear in its time; the rain will be prevented, and the heavens will retain it.<br>
3. And in those times the fruit of the earth will be tardy and will not grow in its time; and the fruit of the trees will be prevented in its time.<br>
4. And the moon will change her order and will not appear in her time.<br>
5. And in those days it will be seen on the heavens that a great unfruitfulness will come on the outermost chariot in the west; and she will shine more brightly that according to the order of light.<br>
6. And many of the leaders of the stars of command will err, and they will change their paths and deeds, and those subject to them will not appear in their time.<br>
7. And the whole order of the stars will be kept from the sinners, and the thoughts of those who dwell on the earth will err concerning them, and they will be turned from all their ways, and will err and consider them gods.<br>
8. And evil will increase over them, and punishment will come upon them to destroy them all."<br>

The Book of Jubilees is not in the Bible.<br>
It is considered to be one of several books that many might argue and say that it used to be one of the books in the Bible.<br>
The Book of Jubilees 6:36-38<br>
From The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament<br>
by R.H. Charles, Oxford: Clarendon Press.<br>
This is a 1913 English translation.<br>
The Book of Jubilees<br>
[Chapter 6] targeting verses 36 through 38.<br>
We will start in verse 30.<br>
<br>
30 And all the days of the commandment will be two and fifty weeks of days, and (these will make) the entire year complete. Thus it is engraven and ordained on the heavenly tablets.<br>
31 And there is no neglecting (this commandment) for a single year or from year to year.<br>
32 And command thou the children of Israel that they observe the years according to this reckoning- three hundred and sixty-four days, and (these) will constitute a complete year, and they will not disturb its time from its days and from its feasts; for everything will fall out in them according to their testimony, and they will not leave out any day nor disturb any feasts.<br>
33 But if they do neglect and do not observe them according to His commandment, then they will disturb all their seasons and the years will be dislodged from this (order), [and they will disturb the seasons and the years will be dislodged] and they will neglect their ordinances.<br>
34 And all the children of Israel will forget and will not find the path of the years, and will forget the new moons, and seasons, and sabbaths and they will go wrong as to all the order of the years.<br>
35 For I know and from henceforth will I declare it unto thee, and it is not of my own devising; for the book (lies) written before me, and on the heavenly tablets the division of days is ordained, lest they forget the feasts of the covenant and walk according to the feasts of the Gentiles after their error and after their ignorance.<br>
36 For there will be those who will assuredly make observations of the moon -how (it) disturbs the seasons and comes in from year to year ten days too soon.<br>
37 For this reason the years will come upon them when they will disturb (the order), and make an abominable (day) the day of testimony, and an unclean day a feast day, and they will confound all the days, the holy with the unclean, and the unclean day with the holy; for they will go wrong as to the months and sabbaths and feasts and jubilees.<br>
38 For this reason I command and testify to thee that thou mayst testify to them; for after thy death thy children will disturb (them), so that they will not make the year three hundred and sixty-four days only, and for this reason they will go wrong as to the new moons and seasons and sabbaths and festivals, and they will eat all kinds of blood with all kinds of flesh.<br>

Enoch is telling us that the moon falls behind 10 days per year.<br>
Enoch 74:13-16<br>
CHAP. 74. --<br>
13. Three years have one thousand and ninety-two days; and five years, eighteen hundred and twenty days; so that there will be in eight years two thousand nine hundred and twelve days.<br>
14. To the moon alone belongs for three years one thousand and sixty-two days, and for five years she recedes fifty days, which is, to the sum of these are added sixty-two days.<br>
15. And thus in five years there will be seventeen hundred and seventy days, so that the days of the moon for eight years will be two thousand eight hundred and thirty-two days.<br>
16. For her receding in eight years is eighty days, and all the days she remains behind in eight years are eighty days.<br>

Exodus 2:2 (KJV)<br>
And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.<br>

Exodus 2:2 (NLT)<br>
The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She saw that he was a special baby and kept him hidden for three months.<br>
<br>
<br>
Where it said, three months, The Hebrew word used there for, months, is a word that is based on the moon and its lunar cycle.<br>
This Hebrew word used here that we translate into the word, month,<br>
That same Hebrew word was translated into the word, moon, where you see the English word, moon,<br>
in Deuteronomy 33:14 and in Isaiah 60:20.<br>

Enoch 72:4-6<br>
CHAP. 72. --<br>
4. And first comes forth the great luminary called the sun; and his circuit is like the circuit of the heavens, and he is entirely filled with flaming and heating fire.<br>
5. The wagons on which he ascends are driven by the wind, and the sun descending disappears from the heavens and returns through the north in order to reach the east, and is led that he comes to that portal and shines on the surface of heaven.<br>
6. And thus he comes forth, in the first month, in the great portal, and he comes forth from the fourth of these six portals towards the east.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is an entire chapter of Enoch.<br>
All of chapter 72, all 37 verses.<br>
Enoch 72: 1-37<br>
CHAP. 72. --<br>
1. The book of the courses of the luminaries of heaven, how it is with each one of them, as to their classes, their governments, and their times, as to their names and origin, and as to their months, which their leader Uriel, a holy angel who was with me, showed to me, and their whole description as it is he showed to me, and how it is with respect to all the years of the world and to eternity, till a new creation is made which will continue to eternity.<br>
2. And this is the first law of the luminaries: the luminary sun has its ascent in the portals of the heavens which are towards the east, and his descent in the western portals of heaven.<br>
3. And I saw six portals, out of which the sun ascends, and six portals into which the sun descends; the moon also rises and sets in these portals, and the leaders of the stars and those led by them; six in the east and six in the west, and all, each after the other, aright; also many windows to the right and to the left of these portals.<br>
4. And first comes forth the great luminary called the sun; and his circuit is like the circuit of the heavens, and he is entirely filled with flaming and heating fire.<br>
5. The wagons on which he ascends are driven by the wind, and the sun descending disappears from the heavens and returns through the north in order to reach the east, and is led that he comes to that portal and shines on the surface of heaven.<br>
6. And thus he comes forth, in the first month, in the great portal, and he comes forth from the fourth of these six portals towards the east.<br>
7. And in that fourth portal, from which the sun comes forth in the first month, there are twelve window openings, from which a flame proceeds when they are opened in their time.<br>
8. When the sun rises from the heavens he comes out of that fourth portal thirty mornings, and descends directly into the fourth western portal of heaven.<br>
9. And in those days the day is daily lengthened, and the nights nightly shortened to the thirtieth morning.<br>
10. And in that day the day is two parts longer than the night, and the day is exactly ten parts and the night eight parts.<br>
11. And the sun comes forth from this fourth portal and sets in the fourth and returns to the fifth portal of the east thirty mornings, and comes forth from it and descends into the fifth portal.<br>
12. From then on the day is lengthened two parts, and the day is eleven parts, and the night is shortened and is seven parts.<br>
13. And the sun returns to the east and goes into the sixth portal, and comes forth and descends into the sixth portal, thirty-one mornings on account of its sign.<br>
14. And on that day the day is longer than the night, and the day will be double the night, and the day is twelve parts, and the night is shorter and is six parts. <br>
15. And the sun is raised so that the day is shortened and the night is lengthened, and the sun returns to the east and enters the sixth portal and rises from it and sets thirty mornings. <br>
16. And when the thirty mornings are completed the day diminishes by exactly ONE part, and the day is eleven parts and the night seven parts.<br>
17. And the sun comes forth from this sixth portal in the west and goes to the east and rises in the fifth portal thirty mornings and sets in the west again in the fifth portal.<br>
18. On that day the day diminishes two parts, and the day will be ten parts and the night eight parts.<br>
19. And the sun comes forth from that fifth portal and descends into the fifth portal of the west and rises in the fourth portal, on account of its sign, thirty-one mornings and descends in the west.<br>
20. On that day the day is equal to the night and becomes equal, and the night is nine parts and the day nine parts.<br>
21. And the sun comes forth from that portal and sets in the west and returns to the east and comes forth from the third portal thirty mornings and sets in the west in the third portal.<br>
22. And on that day the night is longer than the day to the thirtieth morning, and the day becomes shorter daily to the thirtieth morning, and the night is exactly ten parts and the day eight parts.<br>
23. And the sun comes forth from that third portal and sets in the third portal in the west and returns to the east, and the sun goes into the second portal of the east thirty mornings, and in like manner into the second portal in the west of the heavens.<br>
24. And on that day the night is eleven parts and the day seven parts.<br>
25. And the sun comes forth on that day from the second portal and descends in the west into the second portal and returns to the east in the first portal thirty-one mornings and descends into the west into the first portal.<br>
26. And on that day the night will be so long that it will be the double of the day, and the night is exactly twelve parts and the day six parts.<br>
27. And with that the sun has completed his stations, and he again returns to his station and enters in this portal thirty mornings; he rises and sets opposite it in the west.<br>
28. And on that day the night diminishes in length by ONE part, and is eleven parts and the day seven parts.<br>
29. And the sun returns and goes into the second portal of the east and returns to his course thirty mornings, rising and setting.<br>
30. And on that day the night diminishes in length, and the night is ten parts and the day eight parts.<br>
31. And on that day the sun comes forth from the second portal and descends in the west and returns to the east and rises in the third portal thirty-one mornings and sets in the west of the heavens.<br>
32. And on that day the night is shortened and is nine parts, and the day is nine parts, and the night is equal with the day, and the year has exactly three hundred and sixty-four days.<br>
33. And the length of the day and of the night, and the shortness of the day and of the night -- by the course of the sun they are made separated.<br>
34. On that account the day-course becomes longer daily and the night-course shorter nightly.<br>
35. And this is the law and the course of the sun and his return when he returns; sixty times he returns and comes out, that is the great, eternal luminary which is called the sun to all eternity.<br>
36. And that which thus ascends is the great luminary, as it is called on account of its appearance, according to the command of the Lord.<br>
37. And thus he ascends and descends, and is not diminished, and does not rest, but runs day and night in his chariot, and his light shines seven times stronger than that of the moon; but as regards size they are both equal.<br>

13. Three years have one thousand and ninety-two days; and five years, eighteen hundred and twenty days; so that there will be in eight years two thousand nine hundred and twelve days.<br>

<br>
Commentary: The summary of all of this would be, the Scriptures, consisting of books that we still have in our Bible, and other books that used to be in our Bible, all of these books can give us the information we need to calculate when to do Passover and when to do the seven feasts, which is primarily based on the the cycles of the moon defining when a month begins and ends, which is the basis of the ancient Hebrew Lunar Calendar.  The verses that we were just looking at help us make these calculations correctly.  In just a moment, we will see where the feast dates land on the calendar system that we commonly use today. It is your heart of wanting to do the feasts that is most important. Others may end up making slightly different calculations, and may choose dates one day sooner or one day later, or one month sooner or one month later. Let's encourage each other to do the seven feasts, and appreciate and respect each other for wanting to do so, even if we do not all exactly agree on the dates.<br>
<br>
We will now bring this to a close, by looking at two verses in the book of Revelation, and finish this Bible study by looking at when the seven feasts would happen on our modern calendar system.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 22:2 (KJV)<br>
In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.<br>
<br>
Revelation 22:2 (NLT)<br>
It flowed down the centre of the main street. On each side of the river grew a tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, with a fresh crop each month. The leaves were used for medicine to heal the nations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Someday, we will not need to use the moon for date and time calculations anymore.<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:23 (KJV)<br>
And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:23 (NLT)<br>
And the city has no need of sun or moon, for the glory of God illuminates the city, and the Lamb is its light.<br>

Jewish Prayer<br>
<br>
<br>
Jewish Prayers and Blessings<br>
<br>
There are a number of Jewish prayer books, containing a set order of daily prayers.<br>
The common and most popular book is known as a Siddur.<br>
The Siddur is not in the Bible.<br>
These various Jewish prayers are not in the Bible, but they do reference many of the verses and truths and concepts that are in the Bible.<br>
The Hebrew word, Siddur, means, order.<br>
There are many different types and variations of these Jewish prayer books, and the prayers themselves.<br>
Let's take a look at these Traditional prayers, and combine them together to make<br>
a really nice and good, long prayer.<br>
One significant thing to mention, is that the Bible does not command us to light candles to start the Sabbath day of rest,<br>
so we will not be including that content in this prayer, because<br>
that commandment does not exist in the Bible.<br>
<br>
We will now take bits of content from several traditional Jewish prayers and merge them into one prayer.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew names are spelled out with English letters in such a way so that, when this prayer is spoken out loud, the Hebrew names are pronounced accurately.<br>
<br>
With the compiled content from various traditional Jewish prayers and blessings,<br>
Let us pray.<br>
<br>
Dear Lord Jesus,<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
<br>
I give thanks unto You, Yaw-Who-Wah, that, in mercy, You have restored my soul within me.<br>
Endless is Your compassion; great is Your faithfulness.<br>
I thank You, Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, for the rest You have given me through the night and for the breath that renews my body and spirit.<br>
May I renew my soul with faith in You, Source of all Healing. Blessed are You,<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw our God, Ruler of the Universe,<br>
<br>
Give ear, Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, to my prayer, heed my plea for mercy.<br>
In time of trouble I call to You, for You will answer me.<br>
<br>
When pain and fatigue are my companions, let there be room in my heart for strength.<br>
When days and nights are filled with darkness, let the light of a good courage find its place.<br>
Help me to endure the suffering and dissolve the fear. Renew within me the calm spirit of peace.<br>
<br>
Blessed are You, Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, Healer of the Sick.<br>
<br>
Lord, God Almighty, EE-Low-Heem, You are with me in my moments of strength and of weakness.<br>
You know the trembling of my heart as another turning point draws near,<br>
as one chapter ends and another chapter begins,<br>
The chapters of the story of my life, the times and the seasons, are in your hands.<br>
<br>
Grant that I may return to fullness of life and wholeness of strength,<br>
not for my sake alone but for those around me, that you have placed into my life.<br>
Enable me to complete my days on earth with dignity and purpose for you, for your glory and for your kingdom.<br>
May I awaken now to know the Torah, the truth, and the breadth of Your healing power, now and forever more.<br>
<br>
You are with me; I shall not fear.<br>
<br>
Praised are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who brings sleep to my eyes, slumber to my eyelids.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, Lord my God and God of my ancestors, may it be Your will that I lie down in peace and rise up in peace.<br>
<br>
Let not any of my thoughts, my worries, my concerns, my burdens, my troubling thoughts, any bad dreams, or any wicked schemes, or any kind of dream, or any of my daydreams disturb me. Watch over my family and those I love.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, O Guardian of Israel, who neither slumbers nor sleeps, I entrust my spirit to You.<br>
Thus as I go to sleep, I put myself into Your safekeeping.<br>
<br>
Grant me a night of rest, security and safety. Let the healing processes that You have placed into my body go about their work with your blessing. May I awaken in the morning, strengthened, refreshed and renewed to face a new tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Hear, O Israel, Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw our God, Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw is One!<br>
<br>
We praise You, Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, Whose shelter of peace is spread over us, over all Your people Israel, over every creation, and over Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, you are gracious, your grace is sufficient for me,<br>
you are full of compassions that fail not, you are slow to anger,<br>
and you are of great mercy,<br>
you are filled with tender mercies and a loving-kindness that is better than life.<br>

He is Yaw, EE-Low-Heem, the only wise God, the true God and His word, the Torah, is perfect, true and eternal.<br>
<br>
We thankfully receive your mercy, your grace and your forgiveness,<br>
For the mistakes we committed before You<br>
under duress and willingly.<br>
through having a hard heart<br>
through things we blurted out with our lips.<br>
from harsh speech<br>
from wronging a friend.<br>
<br>
We confess to you now that we have sinned and that we need your salvation.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, Save us, help us, heal us, and show us the way, and help us walk on and stay on your good, wise, true path of righteousness.<br>
<br>
We thankfully receive your mercy, your grace and your forgiveness,<br>
from all of our sins, known and not known<br>
public and private, obvious and secret<br>
deliberate or accidental<br>
concealed or revealed<br>
For the mistakes we committed before You<br>
by degrading parents and teachers.<br>
through denial and false promises<br>
through negative speech.<br>
with food and drink.<br>
by being arrogant.<br>
by having a strong forehead of brazenness, arrogance and pride.<br>
from throwing off the yoke, from refusing to accept responsibility.<br>
<br>
We thankfully receive your mercy, your grace and your forgiveness,<br>
from all the sins and from all the mistakes that we have committed before You<br>
through jealousy<br>
through baseless hatred.<br>
through confusion of the heart.<br>
<br>

and has preserved us, and enabled us to reach this next and new season.<br>

the Seven feasts of Yaw-Who-Wah, and the sabbath days that are within them.<br>

Let my prayer come before you<br>

I have done in my lifetime.<br>
All sins of my past, present and future.<br>
My wicked deeds and sins embarrass me.<br>
Please accept my pain and suffering as<br>
Atonement and forgive my wrongdoings,<br>
For against You alone have I sinned.<br>
May it be your will, God of my ancestors,<br>
That I sin no more.<br>
With your great compassion cleanse me of my sins,<br>
But not through suffering and disease.<br>
Send a perfect healing to me and to all who are stricken.<br>
My God and God of my ancestors,<br>
I acknowledge that my life and recovery<br>
Depend upon You.<br>
May it be Your will to heal me<br>
Shelter me in the shadow of Your wings;<br>

<br>
John 5:22 (KJV)<br>
For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement unto the Son:<br>

Enoch 69: 26 & 27 -- 1912 Edition by R.H. Charles<br>
26 And there was great joy amongst them,<br>
And they blessed and glorified and extolled<br>
Because the name of that Son of Man had been revealed unto them.<br>
27 And he sat on the throne of his glory,<br>
And the sum of judgement was given unto the Son of Man,....<br>
<br>
Enoch 68: 37-39 -- 1883 Edition by Richard Laurence<br>
68:37 Great was their joy.<br>
68:38 They blessed, glorified, and exalted, because the name of the Son of man was revealed to them.<br>
68:39 He sat upon the throne of his glory; and the principal part of the judgement was assigned to him, the Son of man....<br>

When we were in Christian Essays 21, we did a study called, Candles.<br>
In that study, we mentioned some cool lists with seven items listed.<br>
Mainly because of the inspiration behind the Sevenfold spirit of Yaw-Who-Wah, or, the seven spirits of Yaw-Who-Wah,<br>
listed in Isaiah 11:2.<br>
<br>
We now conclude with a bonus list of seven items from the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
Enoch 60:13-16 -- 1883 Edition by Richard Laurence<br>
<br>
60:13 He shall call to every power of the heavens, to all the holy above, and to the power of God. The Cherubim, the Seraphim, and the Ophanin, all the angels of power, and all the angels of the Lords, namely, of the Elect One, and of the other Power, who [was] upon earth over the water on that day,<br>
<br>
60:14 Shall raise their united voice; shall bless, glorify, praise, and exalt with the spirit of faith, with the spirit of wisdom and patience, with the spirit of mercy, with the spirit of judgement and peace, and with the spirit of benevolence; all shall say with united voice; Blessed is He; and the name of the Lord of spirits shall be blessed for ever and for ever; all, who sleep not, shall bless it in heaven above.<br>
<br>
60:15 All the holy in heaven shall bless it; all the elect who dwell in the garden of life; and every spirit of light, who is capable of blessing, glorifying, exalting, and praising your holy name; and (all of flesh) every mortal man, more than the powers [of heaven], shall glorify and bless your name for ever and ever.<br>
60:16 For great is the mercy of the Lord of spirits; long-suffering is he; and all his works, all his power, great as are the things which he has done, has he revealed to the saints and to the elect, in the name of the Lord of spirits.<br>
<br>
Commentary: In verse 13, where it says, the other Power, who [was] upon earth over the water on that day,<br>
Is that referring to the Holy Sprit which descended upon earth like a dove, over the water when Jesus was still standing in the Water, right after getting baptised by John the Baptist?<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 59: 10 & 11 -  -- 1912 Edition by R.H. Charles<br>
10 And He will summon all the host of the heavens, and all the holy ones above, and the host of God, the Cherubic, Seraphin and Ophannin,<br>
and all the angels of power, and all the angels of principalities,<br>
11 and the Elect One, and the other powers on the earth [and] over the water. On that day shall raise one voice,<br>
and bless and glorify and exalt in the spirit of faith, and in the spirit of wisdom, and in the spirit of patience, and in the spirit of mercy,<br>
and in the spirit of judgement and of peace, and in the spirit of goodness, and shall all say with one voice:<br>
"Blessed is He, and may the name of the Lord of Spirits be blessed for ever and ever."<br>
<br>
Again, the various English translators for the Book of Enoch were not in agreement on the numbering of their chapter numbers and verse numbers.<br>
That's why the chapter and verse numbers for one English translation do not synchronise with the verse numbers and chapter numbers of a different English translation.<br>
<br>
OK, let's use these two translations to make the list.<br>
We bless and glorify and exalt<br>
We bless, glorify, praise, and exalt,<br>
1. the spirit of faith<br>
2. the spirit of wisdom<br>
3. the spirit of patience<br>
4. the spirit of mercy<br>
5. the spirit of judgement<br>
6. the spirit of peace<br>
7. the spirit of benevolence and goodness<br>
<br>
The first 6 items out of the list of 7 were perfectly identical in both English Enoch translations.<br>

Psalms 90: 9 & 10 (KJV)<br>
(For all our days are turned away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is old.)<br>
90:9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.<br>
(As for the days of our years, in them are seventy years;)<br>
90:10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 90: 9 & 10 NLT<br>
9<br>
We live our lives beneath your wrath,<br>
ending our years with a groan.<br>
10<br>
Seventy years are given to us!<br>
Some even live to eighty.<br>
But even the best years are filled with pain and trouble;<br>
soon they disappear, and we fly away.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 55: 4-6 (KJV)<br>
55:4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.<br>
55:5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.<br>
(horror hath covered me.)<br>
55:6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 55: 3-6 NLT<br>
3<br>
My enemies shout at me,<br>
making loud and wicked threats.<br>
They bring trouble on me<br>
and angrily hunt me down.<br>
4<br>
My heart pounds in my chest.<br>
The terror of death assaults me.<br>
5<br>
Fear and trembling overwhelm me,<br>
and I can't stop shaking.<br>
6<br>
Oh, that I had wings like a dove;<br>
then I would fly away and rest!<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 11:28 KJV<br>
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<br>
<br>
Since we are looking at verses that talk about flying away, in just a moment, we will read the words to the famous, old hymn, I'll Fly Away.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 4: 16-18 KJV<br>
4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:<br>
4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.<br>
(Wherefore exhort one another with these words.)<br>
4:18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 4: 16-18 NLT<br>
16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God.<br>
(First, the dead in Christ will rise from their graves.)<br>
First, the believers who have died will rise from their graves.<br>
17 Then, together with them, we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Then we will be with the Lord forever.<br>
18 So encourage each other with these words.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 4: 16-18 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:<br>
17 Then shall we which live and remain, be caught up with them also in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.<br>
18 Wherefore, comfort yourselves one another with these words.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 4: 16-18 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
16 Because the Master Himself shall come down from heaven with a shout, with the voice of a chief messenger, and with the trumpet of EE-Low-Heem, and the dead in Messiah shall rise first.<br>
17 Then we, the living who are left over, shall be caught away together with them in the clouds to meet the Master in the air -- and so we shall always be with the Master.<br>
18 So, then, encourage one another with these words.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:9 KJV<br>
For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6:11 KJV<br>
Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6:11 NLT<br>
Put on all of God's armour so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6:13 KJV<br>
Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59: 15-17 (NLT)<br>
15<br>
Yes, truth is gone,<br>
and anyone who renounces evil is attacked.<br>
The Lord (Yaw-Who-Wah) looked and was displeased<br>
to find there was no justice.<br>
16<br>
He was amazed to see that no one intervened<br>
to help the oppressed.<br>
So he himself stepped in to save them with his strong arm,<br>
and his justice sustained him.<br>
17<br>
He put on righteousness as his body armour<br>
and placed the helmet of salvation on his head.<br>
He clothed himself with a robe of vengeance<br>
and wrapped himself in a cloak of divine passion.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Those of us who are saved, and are studying the Bible, and are trying our best to obey Torah, the Bible, we will not be surprised when the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.<br>
Let me say that again. We will NOT be surprised when the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.<br>
It's hard to be surprised about something when you know it's going to happen and you are expecting it to happen.<br>
For the world in general, the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief, but not to us who are expecting it to happen.<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5: 4-11 -- NLT<br>
(But you aren't in the dark about these things, dear brothers and sisters, and you won't be surprised when the day of the Lord comes upon you as if you were thieves.)<br>
4 But you aren't in the dark about these things, dear brothers and sisters, and you won't be surprised when the day of the Lord comes like a thief.<br>
5 For you are all children of the light and of the day; we don't belong to darkness and night.<br>
6 So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be clearheaded.<br>
7 Night is the time when people sleep and drinkers get drunk.<br>
8 But let us who live in the light be clearheaded, protected by the armour of faith and love, and wearing as our helmet the confidence of our salvation.<br>
9 For God chose to save us through our Lord Jesus Christ, not to pour out his anger on us.<br>
10 Christ died for us so that, whether we are dead or alive when he returns, we can live with him forever.<br>
11 So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5: 1-11 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
1 Now, brothers, as to the times and the seasons, you do not need to be written to.<br>
2 For you yourselves know very well that the day of Yaw-Who-Wah comes as a thief in the night.<br>
3 For when they say, "Peace and safety!" then suddenly destruction comes upon them, as labour pains upon a pregnant woman, and they shall not escape.<br>
4 But you, brothers, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.<br>
5 For you are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.<br>
6 So, then, we should not sleep, as others do, but we should watch and be sober.<br>
7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.<br>
<br>
(this next verse, verse 8, contains parts that refer to Isaiah 59:17, which we looked at a moment ago in the NLT)<br>
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.<br>
8 But we who are of the day should be sober, putting on the breastplate of belief and love, and as a helmet the expectation of deliverance.<br>
9 Because EE-Low-Heem did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain deliverance through our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah,<br>
10 who died for us, so that we, whether awake or asleep, should live together with Him.<br>
11 Therefore encourage one another, and build up one another, as indeed you do.<br>
<br>

In Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, it has a webpage that tells us about a 1929 song, titled, I'll Fly Away.<br>
Here is a little bit of background about that song, coming from Wikipedia, back in August 2021.<br>
<br>
"I'll Fly Away", is a hymn written in 1929 by Albert E. Brumley and published in 1932 by the Hartford Music company, in a collection titled, Wonderful Message.<br>
<br>
It is often considered to be the most recorded gospel song of all time.<br>
It's inspired from an earlier nineteenth century slave song, which were songs that slaves would sing whilst working.<br>
Some of the words from that slave song, about a bird flying away from a prison, were made popular again in a secular song that was released about five years before Albert E. Brumley wrote this song.<br>
That is what inspired this song, which is why it contains a part that talks about a bird flying away from a prison.<br>
The prison would be, being stuck in this earthly life, and wanting to escape from this world and be set free.<br>
<br>
Since 1940, many people have made recordings of this song over the years.<br>
There are also instrumental recordings, and the song can be heard in several films and TV shows.<br>
It was heard in two episodes of The Waltons.<br>
There was even a TV series made at one time, from 1991 to 1993.  The TV series was named after the hymn.<br>
Those that try to list all of the known recordings of this song will typically end up with a list of over 300 recordings.<br>
Some artists made another, second recording of this song again, years later.<br>
A few recorded examples of some names that we might recognise would include,<br>
Rev. J.M. Gates, made the First known recording in 1940<br>
Selah Jubilee Singers, 1941<br>
George Jones, 1965<br>
Bobby Bare, 1966<br>
Connie Smith, 1970<br>
Jerry Lee Lewis, 1970<br>
The Ray Charles Singers, 1970<br>
Andy Griffith, 1972<br>
Ray Stevens, 1972<br>
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, 1973<br>
Johnny Cash in 1982 and again in 2003,<br>
Willie Nelson and Bobbie Nelson, 1986<br>
Boxcar Willie, 1988<br>
Carroll Baker, 1992<br>
The Oak Ridge Boys, 1997<br>
Loretta Lynn, 1997<br>
The Charlie Daniels Band, 2002<br>
Randy Travis, 2003<br>
Kanye West, 2004<br>
Two different recordings from Jars of Clay, the second one featuring Sarah Kelly, 2005<br>
Alan Jackson, 2006<br>
Hank Williams, his recording was released more than 10 years after it was made, eventually released in 2008<br>
Ronnie Milsap, 2009<br>
Kenny Rogers, 2011<br>
Smalltown Poets, 2012<br>
Alabama, 2014<br>
Reba McEntire, 2017<br>
Steven Curtis Chapman, 2019<br>
<br>
<br>
There have been some variations of the lyrics in the many recordings by many of the various artists over the years.<br>
Those variations will be mentioned here, by repeating the lyric again with the modification included.<br>
<br>
<br>
Written in 1929 and published in 1932, here are the words to the song, I'll Fly Away, by Albert E. Brumley...<br>
<br>
<br>
Some glad morning when this life is over,<br>
I'll fly away;<br>
To a home on God's celestial shore,<br>
I'll fly away (I'll fly away).<br>
<br>
I'll fly away, Oh Glory<br>
I'll fly away; (in the morning)<br>
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,<br>
I'll fly away (I'll fly away).<br>
<br>
When the shadows of this life have gone,<br>
I'll fly away;<br>
Like a bird from prison bars has flown,<br>
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)<br>
<br>
I'll fly away, Oh Glory<br>
I'll fly away; (in the morning)<br>
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,<br>
I'll fly away (I'll fly away).<br>
<br>
Some bright morning when this life is over<br>
I'll fly away<br>
To that home on God's celestial shore<br>
I'll fly away<br>
<br>
When the shadows of this life have grown,<br>
I'll fly away<br>
Like a bird from these prison walls,<br>
I'll fly away<br>
<br>
When the shadows of this life have gone<br>
I'll fly away<br>
Like a bird from these prison walls I'll fly<br>
I'll fly away<br>
<br>
I'll fly away, Oh Glory<br>
I'll fly away; (in the morning)<br>
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,<br>
I'll fly away (I'll fly away).<br>
<br>
Oh how glad and happy when we meet<br>
I'll fly away<br>
No more cold iron shackles on my feet<br>
I'll fly away<br>
<br>
I'll fly away, Oh Glory<br>
I'll fly away; (in the morning)<br>
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,<br>
I'll fly away (I'll fly away).<br>
<br>
Just a few more weary days and then,<br>
I'll fly away;<br>
To a land where joy shall never end,<br>
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)<br>
<br>
