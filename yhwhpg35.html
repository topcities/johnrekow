Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

Zechariah 14: 13-17 -- NLT<br>
12 And the Lord will send a plague on all the nations that fought against Jerusalem. Their people will become like walking corpses, their flesh rotting away. Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.<br>
13 On that day they will be terrified, stricken by the Lord with great panic. They will fight their neighbours hand to hand.<br>
14 Judah, too, will be fighting at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the neighbouring nations will be captured -- great quantities of gold and silver and fine clothing.<br>
15 This same plague will strike the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the other animals in the enemy camps.<br>
16 In the end, the enemies of Jerusalem who survive the plague will go up to Jerusalem each year to worship the King, the Lord of Heaven's Armies, and to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.<br>
17 Any nation in the world that refuses to come to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of Heaven's Armies, will have no rain.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
It could be that, this plague, this curse, here in Zechariah 14, is referenced at the very end of the Book of Malachi.<br>
<br>
There are several books in the Old Testament where the chapter numbering in the Hebrew text was slightly different from what we have now in our English Bibles.<br>
That is just something to keep in mind in case you should do a deeper Bible study of the Hebrew text in the Old Testament.<br>
The chapters in The Book of Malachi, in the Hebrew text, were originally numbered as having just three chapters, instead of the four chapters that we have today in our English Bibles.<br>
That would mean, The Book of Malachi that we have today, Chapter 4: verses 1-6 are numbered as, Chapter 3: verses 19-24 in the Hebrew text.<br>
<br>
What we read as His English name, The Lord, in Hebrew, His name would be pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
In the KJV, we see the name of, The Lord of Hosts.<br>
In the NLT, He is called, The Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
In Hebrew, this name would be pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, which, in English, becomes, The Lord of Hosts, or, The Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
<br>
The name, God, in Hebrew, in the TS2009, is called, Elohim, which is pronounced, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
In the Eth Cepher, it is spelled with a letter Y at the end, instead of the letter I, as seen in the TS2009.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mount Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Book of Malachi, End of Chapter 3 and all of Chapter 4.<br>
Chapter 3, starting at verse 16<br>
and we keep reading to the end of the book of Malachi,<br>
which is at chapter 4, verse 6 -- KJV<br>
<br>
3:16 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.<br>
3:17 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts,<br>
(in that day when I make up my special treasure;)<br>
in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.<br>
3:18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.<br>
4:1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.<br>
4:2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.<br>
4:3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
4:4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgements.<br>
4:5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:<br>
4:6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.<br>

Book of Malachi, End of Chapter 3 and all of Chapter 4.<br>
Chapter 3, starting at verse 16<br>
and we keep reading to the end of the book of Malachi,<br>
which is at chapter 4, verse 6 -- NLT<br>
<br>
16 Then those who feared the Lord spoke with each other, and the Lord listened to what they said. In his presence, a scroll of remembrance was written to record the names of those who feared him and always thought about the honour of his name.<br>
17 "They will be my people," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies. "On the day when I act in judgement, they will be my own special treasure. I will spare them as a father spares an obedient child.<br>
18 Then you will again see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not."<br>
1 The Lord of Heaven's Armies says, "The day of judgement is coming, burning like a furnace. On that day the arrogant and the wicked will be burned up like straw. They will be consumed -- roots, branches, and all.<br>
("But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings.)<br>
2 "But for you who fear my name, the Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in his wings. And you will go free, leaping with joy like calves let out to pasture.<br>
3 On the day when I act, you will tread upon the wicked as if they were dust under your feet," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
4 "Remember to obey the Law of Moses, my servant -- all the decrees and regulations that I gave him on (Mount Horeb,) Mount Sinai for all Israel.<br>
5 "Look, I am sending you the prophet Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord arrives.<br>
6 His preaching will turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers. Otherwise I will come and strike the land with a curse."<br>

Book of Malachi, End of Chapter 3 and all of Chapter 4.<br>
Chapter 3, starting at verse 16<br>
and we keep reading to the end of the book of Malachi,<br>
which is at chapter 4, verse 6 -- TS2009<br>
<br>
16 Then shall those who fear Yaw-Who-Wah speak to one another, and Yaw-Who-Wah listens and hears, and a book of remembrance be written before Him, of those who fear Yaw-Who-Wah, and those who think upon His Name.<br>
17 "And they shall be Mine," said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, "on the day that I prepare a treasured possession. And I shall spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.<br>
18 "Then you shall again see the difference between the righteous and the wrong, between one who serves ELL-Low-Heem and one who does not serve Him.<br>
1 "For look, the day shall come, burning like a furnace, and all the proud, and every wrongdoer shall be stubble. And the day that shall come shall burn them up," said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, "which leaves to them neither root nor branch.<br>
2 "But to you who fear My Name the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings. And you shall go out and leap for joy like calves from the stall.<br>
3 "And you shall trample the wrongdoers, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I do this," said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
4 "Remember the Torah of Moe-Shay, My servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL)  --  laws and right-rulings.<br>
5 "See, I am sending you Eliyah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome day of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
6 "And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with utter destruction."<br>

Isaiah 14:12 -- NLT<br>
"How you are fallen from heaven,<br>
O shining star, son of the morning!<br>
You have been thrown down to the earth,<br>
you who destroyed the nations of the world.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The name of Lucifer is in this verse, but the NLT did not include that name in their translation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 14:12 -- KJV<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The KJV and NLT do a strange thing here in Isaiah 14:12. Right after the spot where it says, son of the morning, there is a Hebrew word there that is ignored and skipped.<br>
They just skip right over it. Why would they do that?  It is right there.<br>
They just skip right over a Hebrew word, that is pronounced, Yah-LeLL.<br>
<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning Yah-LeLL.<br>
If we consult our usual reference books that we have mentioned many times before,<br>
which would be the Strong's Hebrew, and the Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions,<br>
they tell us that this ignored word,<br>
Yah-LeLL, means,<br>
to howl (with a wailing tone) or yell (with a boisterous one) (with a boisterous tone)<br>
to howl, wail, make a howling.<br>
<br>
<br>
If we try to put that in there, it would be like this...<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning Yah-LeLL.<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning, howling.<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, howling.<br>
<br>
The Eth Cepher did not ignore it. This translation has it, but it gets moved over so that it is just before the word, morning, like this...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 14:12 -- Eth Cepher, 3rd Edition, Revision 2.1 (2020)<br>
How you are fallen from heaven, O Heylel (Hey-LayLL), son of the howling morning! how are you cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Lucifer (Hey-LayLL), is the name of the light-bearer, Satan, also known as the king of Babylon.<br>
When satan got thrown out of heaven, falling from heaven, he must have been howling and yelling on his way down!<br>
Why would some translations remove this?<br>
<br>
One is a light-bearer, and one is pure light with no darkness at all.<br>
One has a light, one is light.<br>
One can look like an angel of light, one is light, pure light.<br>
Two stars, one still shining, one fallen: This is the picture of Jesus versus Satan.<br>
Satan was a star, but his light shall be extinguished.<br>
Jesus is the star. Although he was killed, he rose again and resumed his place in the heavens.<br>
One is real. The other one is a fake, counterfeit wannabe.<br>
Jesus is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Satan goes around roaring like a lion or as a lion, but Satan is not a lion. Jesus is.<br>
One is the lion, the other is lyin' about being a lion.<br>
In Matthew 10:16, Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, said, Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.<br>
As he was forced out of heaven, the fallen one was howling as he was falling down, and what sound do wolves make?<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 12: 7-9 -- NLT<br>
7 Then there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels.<br>
8 And the dragon lost the battle, and he and his angels were forced out of heaven.<br>
9 This great dragon -- the ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, the one deceiving the whole world -- was thrown down to the earth with all his angels.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Peter saw Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, and His majestic splendour with his own eyes, remembering that event that is now nicknamed, The Transfiguration. He was there when it happened.<br>
The three accounts of this event are found in<br>
Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9:2-8, and Luke 9:28-36.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1: 18-21 -- NLT<br>
18 We ourselves heard that voice from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.<br>
19 Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by the prophets.<br>
You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place --<br>
until the Day dawns, and Christ the Morning Star shines in your hearts.<br>
(and Christ the Morning Star rises in your hearts.)<br>
20 Above all, you must realise that<br>
(no prophecy in Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,)<br>
no prophecy in Scripture ever came from the prophet's own understanding,<br>
21 or from human initiative. No, those prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit, and they spoke from God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 22:16 -- NLT<br>
"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this message for the churches.<br>
(I am the root and offspring of David.)<br>
I am both the source of David and the heir to his throne.<br>
I am the bright morning star."<br>

Matthew 10:26 (KJV)<br>
Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.<br>
<br>
Matthew 10:26 (NLT)<br>
"But don't be afraid of those who threaten you. For the time is coming when everything that is covered will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 2 & 3 (KJV)<br>
12:2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.<br>
12:3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 2 & 3 (NLT)<br>
2 The time is coming when everything that is covered up will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.<br>
3 Whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be shouted from the housetops for all to hear!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 8:17 (KJV)<br>
For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 8:17 (NLT)<br>
For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4:22 (KJV)<br>
For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4:22 (NLT)<br>
For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.<br>

<br>
Luke 17: 1-10 -- KJV<br>
17:1 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!<br>
17:2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.<br>
17:3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.<br>
17:4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.<br>
17:5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.<br>
17:6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.<br>
17:7 But which of you, having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?<br>
17:8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?<br>
17:9 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trough not.<br>
17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 17: 1-10 -- NLT<br>
1 One day Jesus said to his disciples, "There will always be temptations to sin, but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting!<br>
2 It would be better to be thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to fall into sin.<br>
3 So watch yourselves!<br>
("If your brother sins,)<br>
"If another believer sins, rebuke that person; then if there is repentance, forgive.<br>
4 Even if that person wrongs you seven times a day and each time turns again and asks forgiveness, you must forgive."<br>
5 The apostles said to the Lord, "Show us how to increase our faith."<br>
6 The Lord answered, "If you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'May you be uprooted and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you!<br>
7 "When a servant comes in from ploughing or taking care of sheep, does his master say, 'Come in and eat with me'?<br>
8 No, he says, 'Prepare my meal, put on your apron, and serve me whilst I eat. Then you can eat later.'<br>
9 And does the master thank the servant for doing what he was told to do? Of course not.<br>
10 In the same way, when you obey me you should say, 'We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.'"<br>

2 Corinthians 2: 14-17 -- KJV<br>
2:14 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.<br>
2:15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:<br>
2:16 To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?<br>
(For we are not as many, which deal deceitfully with the word of God:)<br>
2:17 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Since the NLT team decided to use the word, huckster, a quick look in the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford dictionaries, will tell us...<br>
A huckster is a street trader; a hawker or pedlar, an aggressive seller, one who sells aggressively.<br>
A huckster in these modern days is a person who writes advertisements, especially for radio and television, or who sells things or brings ideas or people to the public's attention in a noisy, annoying way.<br>
If you refer to someone as a huckster, you are criticising them for trying to sell useless or worthless things in a dishonest or aggressive way.<br>
A huckster is a person who uses aggressive or annoying methods to sell something.<br>
In the United States, it can also be a person who sells things in the street or by visiting people's houses.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 2: 14-17 -- NLT<br>
14 But thank God! He has made us his captives and continues to lead us along in Christ's triumphal procession. Now he uses us to spread the knowledge of Christ everywhere, like a sweet perfume.<br>
15 Our lives are a Christ-like fragrance rising up to God. But this fragrance is perceived differently by those who are being saved and by those who are perishing.<br>
16 To those who are perishing, we are a dreadful smell of death and doom. But to those who are being saved, we are a life-giving perfume. And who is adequate for such a task as this?<br>
(You see, we are not like the rest of the hucksters who preach for personal profit.)<br>
17 You see, we are not like the many hucksters who preach for personal profit. We preach the word of God with sincerity and with Christ's authority, knowing that God is watching us.<br>

1 Corinthians 2:9 -- KJV<br>
But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 2:9 -- NLT<br>
That is what the Scriptures mean when they say,<br>
"No eye has seen, no ear has heard,<br>
and no mind has imagined<br>
what God has prepared<br>
for those who love him."<br>
<br>
(1 Corinthians 2:9 is quoting from Isaiah 64:4.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 64:4 -- KJV<br>
(For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God beside thee which doeth so for him that waiteth for him.)<br>
For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.<br>
<br>

1 Corinthians 2: 12-16 -- KJV<br>
2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.<br>
2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.<br>
2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.<br>
2:15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.<br>
(But he that is spiritual discerneth all things, yet he himself is discerned of no man.)<br>
(For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he shall instruct him?)<br>
2:16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 2: 12-16 -- NLT<br>
12 And we have received God's Spirit (not the world's spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us.<br>
<br>
13 When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit,<br>
using the Spirit's words to explain spiritual truths.<br>
(explaining spiritual truths in spiritual language.)<br>
(explaining spiritual truths to spiritual people.)<br>
<br>
(But people who don't have the Spirit can't receive these truths from God's Spirit.)<br>
(But people who have only physical life can't receive these truths from God's Spirit.)<br>
14 But people who aren't spiritual can't receive these truths from God's Spirit. It all sounds foolish to them and they can't understand it, for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means.<br>
<br>
15 Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things, but they themselves cannot be evaluated by others.<br>
16<br>
For,<br>
"Who can know the Lord's thoughts?<br>
Who knows enough to teach him?"<br>
But we understand these things, for we have the mind of Christ.<br>

1 Corinthians 11: 23-29 -- KJV<br>
11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:<br>
11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,<br>
Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you:<br>
this do in remembrance of me.<br>
(this do for a remembrance of me.)<br>
11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.<br>
11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup,<br>
(shew ye the Lord's death till he come.)<br>
ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<br>
11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.<br>
11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.<br>
11:29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Verse 27 and verse 29 have the word, unworthily.<br>
Both of these instances of, unworthily, are both being translated from the same Greek word<br>
which is pronounced,<br>
Uh-Knock-See-Ohs<br>
Other ways to say this Greek word, might be like this...<br>
Neck-Soh-s<br>
Ah-Leck-See-Ohs<br>
<br>
It's the same Greek word in both Verse 27 and verse 29, that becomes the English word, unworthily.<br>
it means,<br>
unworthily, in an unworthy manner<br>
irreverently<br>
<br>
A quick look in the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford dictionaries, will tell us...<br>
irreverent means,<br>
lacking respect or reverence<br>
not showing the expected respect for official, important, or holy things<br>
If you describe someone as irreverent, you mean that they do not show respect for people or things that are generally respected.<br>
without due respect or veneration; disrespectful; flippant, cheeky<br>
not showing respect to somebody/something that other people usually respect<br>
<br>
<br>
unworthily means,<br>
not deserving respect, attention<br>
unworthy, without worth; of little or no merit or value.<br>
in a way that deserves no respect, admiration, or support<br>
not deserving or worthy<br>
beneath the level considered befitting (to)<br>
lacking merit or value<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
An example of this would be me handing you a piece of paper.<br>
I hand it to you, and a couple of days later, I ask you, what did you do with that piece of paper?<br>
And then you say, oh, I'm not sure, maybe I binned it, I threw it away, or maybe I used it for a bookmark in one of those books stacked over there.<br>
Then I say, did you notice that the piece of paper was a fifty pound (£50) banknote? Or, in the United States, I might say, oh, didn't you notice that the piece of paper was a fifty dollar ($50) bill?<br>
It was paper cash money. It was a physical piece of paper, but it had value and worth.<br>
Treating banknotes and paper cash money as ordinary pieces of paper is treating them unworthily, not giving them the worth, value, attention and respect that they deserve.<br>
<br>
Treating communion, the breaking of bread as, just a quick bite of bread or cracker, and quick sip of juice or wine, and thinking nothing more of it than that, is treating it unworthily, not giving it the worth, value, attention and respect that it deserves.<br>
It reminds us that He has entered into us, saves us, heals us, remodels us and dwells within us, filling us with His spirit so that we have the strength and power to follow him, obey him, and keep His commandments.<br>
Like the bread entering into you and becoming a part of you, that bread reminds you that He has entered into you and has now become a part of you.<br>
The bread, His body, is now a part of your body, making you part of the body of Christ; one big body of believers all around the world.<br>
Be thankful and remember that, doing that in remembrance of Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11: 23-29 -- NLT<br>
23 For I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread<br>
24 and gave thanks to God for it.<br>
Then he broke it in pieces and said, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."<br>
("This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.")<br>
("This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me.")<br>
<br>
25 In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant between God and his people -- an agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it."<br>
26 For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes again.<br>
<br>
(So anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is responsible for sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.)<br>
27 So anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.<br>
28 That is why you should examine yourself before eating the bread and drinking the cup.<br>
29 For if you eat the bread or drink the cup without honouring (the body, the Lord's body, the Master's body) the body of Christ, you are eating and drinking God's judgement upon yourself.<br>

Commentary:<br>
In Christian Essays 9, the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 9,<br>
In the Bible study, called, Passover, we saw this next verse mentioned during that Bible study.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Right after Jesus Feeds Five Thousand, people kept following Him around, everywhere.<br>
He finally turns around, and basically tells them that He knows why they are following Him around.<br>
It is not to learn something, it is not to hear more of His teachings, it is not to listen and to follow and to obey Him.<br>
They just want the free food. Jesus knew what was going on in their inner thoughts and minds.<br>
There were those that were there, not because of the teachings of Jesus, not because of the healings and miracles that happened right before their eyes.<br>
They were only there for the free food after the church service.<br>
<br>
Here is the NLT of John 6:26:<br>
Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, you want to be with me because I fed you, not because you understood the miraculous signs.<br>
<br>
Paul saw the same thing.<br>
Very hungry people show up for the church gathering.<br>
Paul would do a prayer with Communion, also known as the Lord's Supper, or the breaking of bread.<br>
He would always do a short prayer with the breaking of bread, before eating the food on the table.<br>
Today, that may be people waiting to pray before starting to eat the meal placed before them on the table.<br>
The tradition of pausing to pray before eating could be traced back to the first act of communion done during His last supper.<br>
<br>
I imagine that people would show up to the church gathering just for the free food, and would not wait, and would not think about the worth and value of what the breaking of bread really means.<br>
Come on, let's get this over with. Eat a piece of bread, or a piece of a cracker, take a sip of wine or grape juice or what have you.<br>
Done. Let's eat, and they race to the front of the queue, and pile on the food on the plate.<br>
As for the old and poor people at the end of the queue, at the end of the line, by the time they get to the food, there's almost nothing left for them.<br>
<br>
People were ignoring the value and worth of the breaking of bread, praying before eating, Communion, the Lord's Supper, because they just wanted to eat lots of food and get drunk with lots of wine.<br>
Paul tells them, if you're really that hungry, you should eat at home first before coming to the gathering, so you don't disgrace God's church and shame the poor.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11: 20-22 -- NLT<br>
20 When you meet together, you are not really interested in the Lord's Supper.<br>
21 For some of you hurry to eat your own meal without sharing with others. As a result, some go hungry whilst others get drunk.<br>
22 What? Don't you have your own homes for eating and drinking? Or do you really want to disgrace God's church and shame the poor? What am I supposed to say? Do you want me to praise you? Well, I certainly will not praise you for this!<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11: 33 & 34 -- NLT<br>
...when you gather for the Lord's Supper, wait for each other.<br>
34 If you are really hungry, eat at home so you won't bring judgement upon yourselves when you meet together.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, this concept that anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is guilty of sinning,<br>
It may be that one should slow down and remember what it means.<br>
<br>
Reminders are of no worth or value if you don't respect, appreciate and remember what the reminders mean.<br>
We have New Covenant reminders that go inside, and we have Old Covenant reminders that are on the outside.<br>
The new covenant reminder is communion, and the old covenant reminder are the blue reminder strings.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Christian Essays 10, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 10,<br>
We did a Bible study, called, Reminders.<br>
We saw a Feminine Hebrew word for a fringe or tassel, which is pronounced,<br>
Seat-Sith, or, Seats, or, Sit-Seen<br>
Today, people may call them, Tzit-Tzit, which is commonly pronounced, Zeet-Zeets.<br>
They are four blue reminder strings on the outside, and we have the bread, blood and water symbolic reminders entering into the inside.<br>
Think about these two reminders working together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Outside first, did not work because the inside needed fixing.<br>
So, Yaw-Who-Shaw goes inside, fixes the inside,<br>
Now the outside can work correctly.<br>
<br>
A car does not go down the road on the outside, so we go inside, under the bonnet, under the hood, to repair it.<br>
Now the car can go down the road fast on the outside, because the inside was fixed.<br>
<br>
You could not do the outside actions of the commandments because your mind was dirty and needed cleaning, and your heart was broken.<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw goes inside, communion, the body, the living water, the life blood going in, so He can clean, and repair and heal and forgive and save.<br>
Now we can go back to the outside and go in the right direction, and perform the right actions, doing the Old Covenant successfully,<br>
doing what the blue string reminders represent. We can perform right on the outside because the inside is fixed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36: 25-27 Commentary:<br>
Verse 25: Trying to stay clean on the outside, (Tzit-Tzit) but the dirty mind and broken heart needs replacement and a change of mind.<br>
Verse 26: He (communion) goes inside, and does a heart replacement.<br>
Verse 27: His spirit now lives and dwells inside of you (communion) on the inside and that causes you to obey him successfully on the outside (Tzit-Tzit).<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36: 25-27 -- NLT<br>
25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship idols.<br>
26 And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart (a heart of flesh.)<br>
27 And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.<br>
<br>
It says, I will, I will and I will. It's not that you will, it says, I will.  He does it, not you.<br>
He cleans the outside, fixes the inside, and causes you to obey and follow him on the outside.<br>
He does it, not you.<br>
<br>
If the car does not work, go inside, fix the car's insides, and now the car can go down the road and get stuff done.<br>
<br>
Old covenant, failed. New Covenant fix, now the Old covenant can be carried out successfully.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now let's talk about how often. Do this often.<br>
<br>
Every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, as often as you eat or drink.<br>
Is that how often they did communion, the breaking of bread?<br>
Did they only do it on Passover? How often should we do this often and in remembrance of Him, not you, not me, but Him, and what He finished on the cross for us?<br>
<br>
<br>
Paul really did appear to do it often. Every time he gathered together, on any days when they gathered together,<br>
on sabbath days and non-sabbath days.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 20: 6 & 7 -- KJV<br>
20:6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.<br>
20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.<br>
<br>
KJV got that right, but the NLT made a mistake in verse 6, when one looks at the original Greek in verse 6.<br>
Let's fix verse 6 in the NLT, and if we do, this is how it should have been said.<br>
<br>
Acts 20: 6 & 7 -- NLT -- If we look at the Greek wording, and put it in verse 6, it should read like this...<br>
6 After the days of unleavened bread ended, we boarded a ship at Philippi in Macedonia and five days later joined them in Troas, where we stayed a week.<br>
7 On the first day of the week, we gathered with the local believers to break bread. Paul was preaching to them, and since he was leaving the next day, he kept talking until midnight.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the NLT mentions the original Greek of verse 6 in a footnote or margin note.<br>
I'm glad they did that. That's why you always need to read the footnotes and margin notes in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The days of unleavened bread, and Passover, are two different things, but they both start at the same time, at sunset, on the same appointed day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Passover is a meal.<br>
The days of unleavened bread are seven days. It is obvious that the NLT team were confused about this, and have made mistakes, saying that Passover is seven days.<br>
When people do not seriously study this in the Bible, they will show their lack of understanding.<br>
The NLT does get confused in some areas in the New Testament.<br>
A preparation day is the day before a day of rest, a Sabbath, which, in Hebrew, is pronounced, Shuh-Bought.<br>
Every Friday is a preparation day, because every Saturday is a Sabbath day of rest, if you are obeying the Bible.<br>
On every Sabbath day of rest, you do not work, you do not make someone work for you for money, and you do not work for someone else for money, and you do not buy or sell, and have money transactions, you do not do these things on every Sabbath day of rest, if you are obeying the Bible.<br>
<br>
The feast of unleavened bread, Day 1 of 7 is a Sabbath, so the day before is a preparation day.<br>
The day begins at sunset on the evening before. At that moment of sunset, Passover is eaten with unleavened bread.<br>
The hours before that sunset would be a preparation day. The Passover lamb would be cooking during that time before sunset.<br>
<br>
The terms, preparation day, Passover, and days of unleavened bread, were confusing to the NLT team, and they have gotten these differences mixed-up, and it shows when comparing the NLT with the KJV.<br>
Keep that in mind when reading the NLT New Testament. If you study the seven feasts carefully, you will detect these mistakes in the NLT.<br>
When you see in the NLT, the words, preparation day, Passover, and days of unleavened bread, remember that they might not be identifying these days accurately in the NLT New Testament.<br>
<br>
Here is what the NLT did, which is wrong, when compared to to words found in the original Greek...<br>
<br>
Acts 20: 6 & 7 -- NLT<br>
6 After the Passover ended, we boarded a ship at Philippi in Macedonia and five days later joined them in Troas, where we stayed a week.<br>
7 On the first day of the week, we gathered with the local believers to share in the Lord's Supper. Paul was preaching to them, and since he was leaving the next day, he kept talking until midnight.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Again, there in verse 6, the original Greek, where the NLT placed the word, Passover, the Greek right there means, "After the days of unleavened bread ended."  Days of unleavened bread, and Passover are two different things. Passover is a meal. So, the question is, did Paul do the breaking of bread communion just before every meal? This example, here in Acts 20: 6 & 7, indicates that he really did it that often.<br>
<br>
Let's think carefully about the information provided right here. First, he did this breaking of bread and praying just before eating a meal. They most likely did it with the Passover meal. The Passover meal would have been at the very start of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.<br>
According to Acts 20: 6 & 7, in the Greek, here is what we see. The feast of Unleavened Bread, we know is seven days long. So, seven days have now come and gone. Next, he gets on a ship. Five more days have now gone by. There is no special feast at this time.<br>
Feasts 1, 2 and 3 of 7 have all passed by, and there is no special feast at this time.<br>
Next, he indicates that he gathered with believers on a Sunday. According to the Bible, a Sunday is an ordinary day of the week. Saturday is a holy, set-apart day of rest, but not Sunday. The idea of Sunday being a day of rest is a satanic lie invented by Catholics, and is not in the Bible at all. So, not a special feast day, not a sabbath day of rest, just an ordinary day where he gathered with the local believers to break bread, and then spends the day teaching and preaching to them. So, this example shows us that, when Paul gathers with believers, he would break bread, which is communion, and he did this even if the day was not a sabbath day, and he did this on any ordinary day, even if there was no special feast day going on at that time. That is how often they did this.  They did not do this only on Passover, they did not do this only on a Sabbath church gathering, they did it even more often than that.<br>
<br>
Again, the idea or tradition of saying a prayer just before eating a meal today, could be traced back to when Paul would do a breaking of bread, and then saying a prayer of thanks just before eating a meal. That still sounds like a great idea, and the Bible totally supports it.<br>
<br>
As we finish up this Bible study, we have another example here of when Paul does this when he was gathered with others. He indicates that he did a breaking of bread, and he did a prayer of thanks with the soldiers and sailors on a ship that was about to be shipwrecked.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 27: 30-38 -- KJV<br>
27:30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,<br>
27:31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.<br>
27:32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.<br>
27:33 And whilst the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.<br>
27:34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.<br>
27:35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.<br>
27:36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.<br>
27:37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.<br>
27:38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 27: 30-38 -- NLT<br>
30 Then the sailors tried to abandon the ship; they lowered the lifeboat as though they were going to put out anchors from the front of the ship.<br>
31 But Paul said to the commanding officer and the soldiers, "You will all die unless the sailors stay aboard."<br>
32 So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and let it drift away.<br>
33 Just as day was dawning, Paul urged everyone to eat. "You have been so worried that you haven't touched food for two weeks," he said.<br>
34 "Please eat something now for your own good. For not a hair of your heads will perish."<br>
35 Then he took some bread, gave thanks to God before them all, and broke off a piece and ate it.<br>
36 Then everyone was encouraged and began to eat --<br>
37 all 276 of us who were on board.<br>
38 After eating, the crew lightened the ship further by throwing the cargo of wheat overboard.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
So, in conclusion, Paul did the breaking of bread and a prayer of thanks just before eating a meal.<br>
<br>
He did it with every meal. He did anyway, even if it was not a Saturday church or fellowship gathering.<br>
Even if it was not on a Shabbat, a Sabbath day of rest, he still did it anyway.<br>
Even if it was not a special feast day, he still did it anyway.<br>
Even if it was not the Passover meal, he still did it anyway.<br>
He did it on any day, at least every time he was gathered with others, eating a meal with others.<br>
<br>
Let's learn from his example. We don't have to wait until a gathering with others.<br>
We don't have to wait until a certain day of the week. We don't have to wait until a certain feast day.<br>
We, too, can take a moment and use the breaking of bread as a reminder that He has entered into us, and dwells inside of us, and we too can give a prayer of thanks.<br>

13:5 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.<br>
13:6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?<br>
13:7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.<br>
13:8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.<br>
13:9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.<br>
13:10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 13: 4-10 -- NLT<br>
4 So he got up from the table, took off his robe, wrapped a towel around his waist,<br>
5 and poured water into a basin. Then he began to wash the disciples' feet, drying them with the towel he had around him.<br>
6 When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"<br>
7 Jesus replied, "You don't understand now what I am doing, but someday you will."<br>
8 "No," Peter protested, "you will never ever wash my feet!"<br>
Jesus replied, "Unless I wash you, you won't belong to me."<br>
9 Simon Peter exclaimed, "Then wash my hands and head as well, Lord, not just my feet!"<br>
10 Jesus replied, "A person who has bathed all over does not need to wash, except for the feet, to be entirely clean. And you disciples are clean....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 13: 12-15 -- KJV<br>
13:12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?<br>
13:13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.<br>
13:14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.<br>
13:15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 13: 12-15 -- NLT<br>
12 After washing their feet, he put on his robe again and sat down and asked, "Do you understand what I was doing?<br>
13 You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and you are right, because that's what I am.<br>
14 And since I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash each other's feet.<br>
15 I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you.<br>

<br>
<br>
Let's now spend another random moment thinking about some things in the book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of Enoch talks about fallen watchers.<br>
Do we have any mention of these fallen watchers in the Bible?<br>
Yes, we do.<br>
In the Old Testament, in Daniel 4, where the NLT says, messenger, in the Aramaic language, it means, watcher.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 4: Verse 13, Verse 23, and then verses 28 through 30, and then verse 33 -- NLT<br>
13 "'Then as I lay there dreaming, I saw a messenger, (a watcher,) a holy one, coming down from heaven.<br>
23 "'Then you saw a messenger, (a watcher,) a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, "Cut down the tree and destroy it. But leave the stump and the roots in the ground, bound with a band of iron and bronze and surrounded by tender grass. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven. Let him live with the animals of the field for seven periods of time."<br>
28 "But all these things did happen to King Nebuchadnezzar.<br>
29 Twelve months later he was taking a walk on the flat roof of the royal palace in Babylon.<br>
30 As he looked out across the city, he said, 'Look at this great city of Babylon! By my own mighty power, I have built this beautiful city as my royal residence to display my majestic splendour.'<br>
<br>
33 "That same hour the judgement was fulfilled, and Nebuchadnezzar was driven from human society. He ate grass like a cow, and he was drenched with the dew of heaven. He lived this way until his hair was as long as eagles' feathers and his nails were like birds' claws.<br>
<br>
<br>
We are targeting Daniel 4, verse 13 and verse 23.<br>
In the KJV...<br>
4:13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;<br>
4:23 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven....<br>
<br>
We will look at that some more, here, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the New Testament, there are two places in the KJV, where we see something that could be these fallen watchers.<br>
In the KJV, they call them, dignities, and in the NLT, they call them, Supernatural Beings.<br>
They did strange and unnatural sexual and genetic modifications, doing strange merging and mixing of genetics, unnatural merging and mixing of different species, creating hybrids of different species.<br>
It was breaking the law, a violation of Torah, to make these creatures.<br>
Here is a list of some of their strange, unnatural hybrid creations...<br>
Centaur - Half man, half horse.<br>
Minotaur - Half man, half bull.<br>
Cyclops - Giant with a single eye in the middle of the forehead.<br>
Satyr (or Faun) - Half man, half goat.<br>
Sphinx - Body of a lion, wings of an eagle, and the face of a woman.<br>
Chimera - A creature with the body and head of a lion, a goat's head emerging from its back, and a tail that ends in a serpent's head.<br>
Hippocampus - Half horse, half fish.<br>
Harpies - Birds with the faces of women.<br>
Griffin - Body of a lion, head, and wings of an eagle.<br>
Gorgon - Woman with snakes for hair, whose gaze turns people to stone (one famous Gorgon was known by the name of Medusa).<br>
Lamia - Woman with the lower body of a serpent.<br>
Echidna - Half woman, half snake.<br>
Manticore - Body of a lion, tail of a scorpion, and a human face.<br>
Typhon - Giant with a hundred dragon heads.<br>
Pegasus - Winged horse.<br>
Cerberus - Three-headed dog.<br>
Hecatoncheires (Hundred-Handers) - Giants with a hundred hands and fifty heads.<br>
Ophiotaurus - Creature that is part bull, part serpent.<br>
Ichthyocentaur - Upper body of a human, lower front of a horse, and tail of a fish.<br>
Sirens - Half bird, half woman, known for their enchanting voices.<br>
Mermaid - The upper body of a human female and the lower body of a fish.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 2:10 -- KJV<br>
2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government (and despise dominion). Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 2:10 -- NLT<br>
These people are proud and arrogant, daring even to scoff at supernatural beings without so much as trembling.<br>
(daring even to scoff at glorious ones, evil angels, without so much as trembling.)<br>
<br>
Jude 1: 6-8 -- KJV<br>
(And the angels which kept not their principality, but left their own habitation,)<br>
1:6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgement of the great day.<br>
1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, (and going after other flesh,) and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.<br>
1:8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.<br>
<br>
Jude 1: 6-8 -- NLT<br>
6 And I remind you of the angels who did not stay within the limits of authority God gave them but left the place where they belonged. God has kept them securely chained in prisons of darkness, waiting for the great day of judgement.<br>
7 And don't forget Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring towns, which were filled with immorality and every kind of sexual perversion. Those cities were destroyed by fire and serve as a warning of the eternal fire of God's judgement.<br>
8 In the same way, these people -- who claim authority from their dreams -- live immoral lives, defy authority, and scoff at supernatural beings.<br>
(and scoff at glorious ones, evil angels.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's go to our usual reference books and find out what is going on in these areas.<br>
<br>
Daniel 4: Verse 13, and Verse 23 -- KJV<br>
4:13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;<br>
4:23 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven....<br>
<br>
Daniel 4: Verse 13, and Verse 23 -- KJV<br>
4:13 ...a watcher<br>
4:23 ...a watcher<br>
<br>
Both of these verses, where it says, watcher, the same Hebrew word is found in both of these locations.<br>
<br>
Again, in both verse 13 and 23, where we see the word, watcher, it is the same Hebrew word in both of those verses.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word is pronounced, EE-Uhr<br>
It sounds very similar to the English word, Ear.<br>
<br>
We will look at this word, and the root words that it comes from.<br>
<br>
It means,<br>
a watcher, that is, an angel (as guardian)<br>
waking, watchful, wakeful one, watcher, angel<br>
through the idea of opening the eyes; to wake (literally or figuratively)<br>
to rouse oneself, awake, awaken, incite<br>
through the idea of opening the eyes<br>
to stir up, rouse, incite<br>
to be excited, be triumphant<br>
to act in an aroused manner, awake<br>
<br>
to be exposed<br>
be bared, be laid bare<br>
<br>
That was in Daniel 4.<br>
Let's look at that word that we saw in 2 Peter 2:10 and in Jude 1:8.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 2:10 -- KJV<br>
we saw, in the KJV, the English word, dignities.<br>
<br>
Jude 1:8 -- KJV<br>
same English word there as well, dignities.<br>
<br>
In both of these places, where they both use the same word, dignities,<br>
It is the exact same Greek word in both of these verses.<br>
In both of these verses, we have the same Greek word there.<br>
In the ancient Greek language, back when the New Testament was written, it was pronounced<br>
Docks-Uh.<br>
In the Greek language today, it may be pronounced,<br>
Icks-Suh<br>
or, possibly, it could be pronounced,<br>
Nicks-Suh<br>
<br>
We will look at this word, and the root words that it comes from.<br>
<br>
It is a word that means,<br>
honour, renown; glory, an especially divine quality, the unspoken manifestation of God, splendour.<br>
visible brightness, splendour, glory: of light<br>
glory (as very apparent)<br>
of the moon, sun, stars<br>
<br>
Commentary: When the angels all come down to escort the believers up into the clouds, all of the stars fall from the sky just before that.<br>
Could those stars, those luminaries, be angels?<br>
It seems logical that they are.<br>
They come down from the heavens to come down here and escort us believers up to where we meet the Messiah up in the clouds.<br>
All of the stars falling down from the sky would be them coming down to here to get us.<br>
<br>
Job 38:7 (KJV)<br>
"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:20 (KJV)<br>
"The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches."<br>
<br>
Enoch 18:15-16 (R.H. Charles' English translation, 1912)<br>
"And I saw the prison of the angels who were held there in punishment. And I watched the stars of heaven come forth."<br>
<br>
Enoch 21:3-6 (R.H. Charles' English translation, 1912)<br>
"And I proceeded to where things were chaotic. And I saw there something horrible: I saw neither a heaven above nor a firmly founded earth, but a place chaotic and horrible. And there I saw seven stars of the heaven bound together in it, like great mountains and burning with fire. Then I said, 'For what sin are they bound, and on what account have they been cast in hither?' Then said Uriel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, and was chief over them, and said: 'Enoch, why dost thou ask, and why art thou eager for the truth? These are of the number of the stars of heaven, which have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and are bound here till ten thousand years, the time entailed by their sins, are consummated.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
One way how we know that the R.H. Charles translation has good precision and accuracy,<br>
is that it compares well with the fragments of Enoch found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls were not yet discovered when R.H. Charles published his Enoch translation in 1912.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered between 1947 and 1956 in a series of caves near the site of Qumran in the West Bank. The first discovery was made by a Bedouin shepherd in early 1947, who stumbled upon the initial cave containing several scrolls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Only fragments of the Book of 1 Enoch were found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls, not the entire book.<br>
These fragments were primarily written in Aramaic and consist of various portions of the text,<br>
indicating that the book was known and used by the community at Qumran.<br>
<br>
Comparative studies generally find that whilst there are some differences between those Aramaic fragments found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Ethiopic text used by R.H. Charles for his translation, the core content and themes are consistent.<br>
<br>
The English translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls by Michael Wise, Martin Abegg, and Edward Cook was published in 1996. The book is titled "The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation," and it includes English translations of many of the scrolls, including fragments of the Book of 1 Enoch.<br>
<br>
Here is one example where they were different.<br>
<br>
Enoch 6:1-2 -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912)
"And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from amongst the children of men and beget us children.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 6:1-2 -- Dead Sea Scrolls English Translation (From Michael Wise, Martin Abegg, and Edward Cook) (1996)<br>
"And it came to pass, when the sons of men had increased, that in those days there were born to them fair and beautiful daughters. And the Watchers, the sons of heaven, saw them and desired them. And they said to one another, 'Come, let us choose for ourselves wives from the daughters of men, and let us beget children for ourselves.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The R.H. Charles translation uses "angels, the children of the heaven," whilst the Dead Sea Scrolls translation uses "Watchers, the sons of heaven." The term "Watchers" is more specific and aligns with the Aramaic term used in the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>
The sons of heaven is more accurate, because we know that they had no women in heaven, because they were eternal, and lived forever, so there was no need to have sexual reproduction, because they did not get old and die in heaven.<br>
That's why the fallen watchers desired to do sexual reproduction experiments, because they did not have sexual reproduction in heaven.<br>
<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls translation tends to have a slightly more modern and less archaic language style compared to R.H. Charles' early 20th-century English.<br>
<br>
Small differences in phrasing exist, such as "beget us children" (Charles) versus "let us beget children for ourselves" (Dead Sea Scrolls). These variations do not significantly alter the meaning but reflect slight differences in translation choices.<br>
<br>
These differences highlight the nuances in translation and terminology but generally maintain the same overall narrative. The variations provide insights into how different translators handle ancient texts and the textual traditions from which they work.<br>
<br>
Here is another example comparing a passage from the R.H. Charles translation of the Book of Enoch with the English translation made from the Dead Sea Scrolls fragments.<br>
<br>
Enoch 8:1-2 -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912)<br>
"And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways."<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 8:1-2 -- Dead Sea Scrolls English Translation (1996)<br>
"And Azazel taught men to make swords and knives and shields and breastplates, and made known to them the metals and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of rouge, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of precious stones, and all colouring tinctures. And there was great impiety; they turned away from God and committed fornication; they were led astray and became corrupt in all their ways."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The term "antimony" in the R.H. Charles translation is translated as "rouge" in the Dead Sea Scrolls translation. Both terms refer to cosmetics, but "rouge" is a more specific modern term for a type of cosmetic.<br>
<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls translation uses "impiety" instead of "godlessness," which is a slight variation in word choice but conveys a similar meaning.<br>
<br>
The phrase "there arose much godlessness" (Charles)<br>
is rendered as<br>
"there was great impiety" in the Dead Sea Scrolls translation.<br>
Similarly, "they committed fornication, and they were led astray" (Charles)<br>
is rendered as<br>
"they turned away from God and committed fornication; they were led astray" in the Dead Sea Scrolls translation,<br>
adding a specific mention of turning away from God.<br>
<br>
These differences illustrate the subtle variations in translation choices and phrasing that can occur even when the overall meaning remains consistent. The more modern translation often aims for clarity and accessibility whilst maintaining fidelity to the original text.<br>
<br>
As of June of 2024, the book "The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation" by Michael Wise, Martin Abegg, and Edward Cook, published in 1996, can be accessed for free online at the Internet Archive. You can read the book and compare translations of the Dead Sea Scrolls there.<br>
They say it is free, but you have to sign-up, register, log in and borrow the book, that is, be given temporary permission to access and read the book online for free, at the Internet Archive website.<br>
<br>
And, that concludes our random little moment, thinking once again about things found in the book of Enoch.<br>

Commentary:<br>
Waiting until you get to heaven to worship and set your hope upon the Son of Man is too late.<br>
Not doing any of that until you show up in heaven is too late, and it does not count.<br>
It's like knowing what the correct answer finally is after your test has been turned in.<br>
You know the correct answer when you get to heaven, but if you did not provide that answer before you go to heaven, then it's too late and does not count.<br>
Your test has been turned in and it is too late to change the answer that you provided when you were alive on the earth, taking the test on the earth.<br>
If you did not provide the correct answer before you get to heaven, then it's too late for you.<br>
You get the, "Depart from me for I never knew you" response right after you know the correct answer in heaven.<br>
You get to stand in heaven just long enough to know that your sin, disobedience and unbelief is sending you to hell, unless you repent and believe before you go to heaven.<br>
<br>
Here is the longer version of that "Depart from me for I never knew you" moment for the unsaved sinner.<br>
But for those who are the saved believers before they get to heaven, that moment is the "Welcome in thou good and faithful servant" moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 62: 5-16 -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912) -- With additional notes and names inserted for easier understanding...<br>
5. And one portion of them (the unsaved sinners) will look on the other (the saved believers),<br>
6. and they (the unsaved sinners) will be terrified, and they (the unsaved sinners) will be downcast of countenance, and pain will seize them when they see that Son of Man (Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck) sitting on the throne of his glory.<br>
7. And the kings and the mighty and all who possess the earth (the unsaved sinners) will bless and glorify and extol Him (Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck) who rules over all, who was hidden.<br>
8. For from the beginning the Son of Man (Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck) was hidden, and the Most High (The Most High God, ELL-ELLE-ON) preserved Him (Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck) in the presence of His might, and revealed Him (Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck) to the elect (the saved believers).<br>
9. And the congregation of the elect and holy (the saved believers) will be sown, and all the elect (the saved believers) will stand before Him (Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck) on that day.<br>
10. And all the kings and the mighty and the exalted and those who rule the earth (the unsaved sinners) will fall down before Him (Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck) on their faces, and worship and set their hope upon that Son of Man (Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck),<br>
11. and petition Him and supplicate for mercy at His hands.<br>
12. Nevertheless that Lord of Spirits (The LORD of Hosts, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat) will so press them (the unsaved sinners) that they will hastily go forth from His presence, and their faces will be filled with shame, and the darkness grows deeper on their faces.<br>
13. And He (The LORD of Hosts, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat) will deliver them (the unsaved sinners) to the angels for punishment, to execute vengeance on them because they (the unsaved sinners) have oppressed His children and His elect (the saved believers).<br>
14. And they (the unsaved sinners) will be a spectacle for the righteous and for His elect (the saved believers): they (the saved believers) will rejoice over them because the wrath of the Lord of Spirits (the wrath of The LORD of Hosts, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat) rests upon them (the unsaved sinners), and His sword is drunk with their blood.<br>
15. And the righteous and elect (the saved believers) will be saved on that day, and they will never again see the face of the sinners and unrighteous.<br>
16. And the Lord of Spirits (The LORD of Hosts, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat) will abide over them, and with that Son of Man (and with Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck) will they (the saved believers) eat and lie down and rise up for ever and ever.<br>

Enoch, Chapter 98, Verses 2-3 -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912)<br>
2<br>
For ye men shall put on more adornments than a woman,<br>
And coloured garments more than a virgin:<br>
In royalty and in grandeur and in power,<br>
And in silver and in gold and in purple,<br>
And in splendour and in food they shall be poured out as water.<br>
3<br>
Therefore they shall be wanting in doctrine and wisdom,<br>
And they shall perish thereby together with their possessions;<br>
And with all their glory and their splendour,<br>
And in shame and in slaughter and in great destitution,<br>
Their spirits shall be cast into the furnace of fire.<br>

Enoch, Chapter 104, Verse 10 to Chapter 105, Verse 2  -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912)<br>
104:10 And now I know this mystery, that sinners will alter and pervert the words of righteousness in many ways, and will speak wicked words, and lie, and practice great deceits, and write books concerning their words.<br>
104:11 But when they write down truthfully all my words in their languages, and do not change or minish aught from my words but write them all down truthfully - all that I first testified concerning them.<br>
104:12 Then, I know another mystery, that books will be given to the righteous and the wise to become a cause of joy and uprightness and much wisdom.<br>
104:13 And to them shall the books be given, and they shall believe in them and rejoice over them, and then shall all the righteous who have learnt therefrom all the paths of uprightness be recompensed.<br>
105:1 In those days the Lord bade them to summon and testify to the children of earth concerning their wisdom: Show it unto them; for ye are their guides, and a recompense over the whole earth.<br>
105:2 For I and My son will be united with them forever in the paths of uprightness in their lives; and ye shall have peace: rejoice, ye children of uprightness. Amen.<br>

Here are three areas that talk about Noah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch, Chapter 89, Verse 1 -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912)<br>

Methuselah is Enoch's son.<br>
Methuselah is the grandfather of Noah.<br>
<br>
Book of Enoch, Chapter 106, Verses 8-19 -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912)<br>
8 And when Methuselah heard the words of his son (Lamech), he came to me (Enoch) to the ends of the earth; for he (Methuselah) had heard that I (Enoch) was there, and he cried aloud, and I heard his voice and I came to him. And I said unto him: 'Behold, here am I, my son, wherefore hast thou come to me?'<br>
9 And he (Methuselah) answered and said: 'Because of a great cause of anxiety have I come to thee, and because of a disturbing vision have I approached.<br>
10 And now, my father, hear me: unto Lamech my son there hath been born a son, the like of whom there is none, and his nature is not like man's nature, and the colour of his body is whiter than snow and redder than the bloom of a rose, and the hair of his head is whiter than white wool, and his eyes are like the rays of the sun, and he opened his eyes and thereupon lighted up the whole house.<br>
11 And he arose in the hands of the midwife, and opened his mouth and blessed the Lord of heaven.<br>
12 And his father Lamech became afraid and fled to me (Methuselah), and did not believe that he was sprung from him, but that he was in the likeness of the angels of heaven; and behold I (Methuselah) have come to thee (Enoch) that thou mayest make known to me the truth.'<br>
13 And I, Enoch, answered and said unto him: 'The Lord will do a new thing on the earth, and this I have already seen in a vision, and make known to thee that in the generation of my father Jared some of the angels of heaven transgressed the word of the Lord.<br>
14 And behold they commit sin and transgress the law, and have united themselves with women and commit sin with them, and have married some of them, and have begot children by them.<br>
15 And they shall produce on the earth giants not according to the spirit, but according to the flesh, and there shall be a great punishment on the earth, and the earth shall be cleansed from all impurity.<br>
16 Yea, there shall come a great destruction over the whole earth, and there shall be a deluge and a great destruction for one year.<br>
17 And this son who has been born unto you shall be left on the earth, and his three children shall be saved with him: when all mankind that are on the earth shall die he and his sons shall be saved.<br>
18 And now make known to thy son Lamech that he who has been born is in truth his son, and call his name Noah; for he shall be left to you, and he and his sons shall be saved from the destruction, which shall come upon the earth on account of all the sin and all the unrighteousness, which shall be consummated on the earth in his days.<br>
19 And after that there shall be still more unrighteousness than that which was first consummated on the earth; for I know the mysteries of the holy ones; for He, the Lord, has showed me and informed me, and I have read them in the heavenly tablets.<br>

Enoch is Noah's great-grandfather.<br>
<br>
Book of Enoch, Chapter 66, Verses 1-3, and we will keep reading to Chapter 67, Verse 1 -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912)<br>
66:1 And after that he (Enoch) showed me (Noah) the angels of punishment who are prepared to come and let loose all the powers of the waters which are beneath in the earth, in order to bring judgement and destruction on all who abide and dwell upon the earth.<br>
66:2 And the Lord of Spirits (The LORD of Hosts, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat) gave commandment to the angels who were going forth, that they should not cause the waters to rise but should hold them in check; for those angels were over the powers of the waters.<br>
66:3 And I (Noah) went away from the presence of Enoch.<br>
67:1 And in those days the word of God came unto me, and said unto me: "Noah, thy lot has come up before Me, a lot without blame, a lot of love and uprightness."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As it was found in June of 2024, a quick look in the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford dictionaries, will tell us...<br>
that the word,<br>
resplendent,<br>
means...<br>
very beautiful, bright, and impressive in appearance,<br>
brilliant or splendid in appearance, to shine brightly.<br>
having a very bright or beautiful appearance,<br>
having a brilliant or splendid appearance,<br>
brightly coloured in an impressive way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Book of Enoch, Chapter 108, Verses 7-15 -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912)<br>
7 For some of them are written and inscribed above in the heaven, in order that the angels may read them and know that which shall befall the sinners and the spirits of the humble, and of those who have afflicted their bodies, and been recompensed by God; and of those who have been put to shame by wicked men:<br>
8 Who love God and loved neither gold nor silver nor any of the good things which are in the world, but gave over their bodies to torture.<br>
9 Who, since they came into being, longed not after earthly food, but regarded everything as a passing breath, and lived accordingly, and the Lord tried them much, and their spirits were found pure so that they should bless His name.<br>
10 And all the blessings destined for them I have recounted in the books. And He hath assigned them their recompense, because they have been found to be such as loved heaven more than their life in the world, and though they were trodden under foot of wicked men, and experienced abuse and reviling from them and were put to shame, yet they blessed Me.<br>
11 And now I will summon the spirits of the good who belong to the generation of light, and I will transform those who were born in darkness, who in the flesh were not recompensed with such honour as their faithfulness deserved.<br>
12 And I will bring forth in shining light those who have loved My holy name, and I will seat each on the throne of his honour.<br>
13 And they shall be resplendent for times without number; for righteousness is the judgement of God; for to the faithful He will give faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths.<br>
14 And they shall see those who were born in darkness led into darkness, whilst the righteous shall be resplendent.<br>
15 And the sinners shall cry aloud and see them resplendent, and they indeed will go where days and seasons are prescribed for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
That last verse right there, which is verse 15 of Chapter 108, is the end of the Book of Enoch, also known as 1 Enoch.<br>
If the end of the Book of Enoch sounds familiar to you,<br>
it could be because, we have studied that area before.<br>
Back when we were in<br>
Christian Essays 33,<br>
also known as, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 33,<br>
we did a Bible study, titled, They Love His Holy Name,<br>
and it was in that study that we were reading the end of the Book of Enoch.<br>
However, in that study, we were reading from the<br>
George H. Schodde 1882 translation, and<br>
the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation.<br>
<br>
What we were reading just now was out of<br>
the R.H. Charles English Translation, from 1912.<br>
R.H. Charles chose to use that word, resplendent.<br>
That's why we did not previously encounter that word, resplendent,<br>
because we were reading from two other English translations previously.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, it seems that there could be three fairly good<br>
English translations of Enoch, all of which can be found online, for free.<br>

Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.<br>

"You search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. But the Scriptures point to me!<br>

And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<br>

Exodus 3: 13-15 -- KJV<br>
3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?<br>
3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.<br>
3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 3: 13-15 -- NLT<br>
13 But Moses protested, "If I go to the people of Israel and tell them, 'The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,' they will ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what should I tell them?"<br>
(God replied to Moses, "I Will Be What I Will Be.)<br>
14 God replied to Moses, "I Am Who I Am. Say this to the people of Israel: I Am has sent me to you."<br>
15 God also said to Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel: (Yaw-Who-Wah), Yahweh, the God of your ancestors -- the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob -- has sent me to you.<br>
This is my eternal name,<br>
my name to remember for all generations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Yahweh (pronounced Yaw-Wea, is a transliteration of the proper name YHWH that is sometimes rendered "Jehovah"; in modern English translations it is usually rendered "the Lord" and is usually spelled with small capital letters.)<br>
YHWH is actually Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
When reading English Bibles, when the Lord is spelled with small capital letters, this indicates that his proper name of Yaw-Who-Wah is found there.<br>
People may take His proper name of Yaw-Who-Wah, and refer to it as, Yaw-Weh, which has the wea sound, the same kind of wea sound as heard in the word, weather.<br>
Other people may say, Yaw-Way.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah is the most correct pronunciation.<br>
Less accurate or technically wrong pronunciations would be<br>
Yaw-Weh, Yah-Way, YHWH, Jehovah, or The LORD, when the letters L O R D are in all capital letters, small capital letters, or in all uppercase letters.<br>
The Lord can also simply mean, Master, in the English language.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the New Testament, they called Jesus, Lord, which means, Master, because he was their master and teacher.<br>
When lord is not in all uppercase or capital letters, it should only mean the word, Master.<br>
This can get confusing in the New Testament.<br>
One example of a place of potential confusion is in Psalms 110.<br>
All of Psalms 110 is another prophecy about Jesus, written hundreds of years before He was born.<br>
All of Psalms 110 did come true and did happen to Jesus.<br>
<br>
Psalms 110:1 is an example of when The Lord, as Yaw-Who-Wah, and the lord as just another name for Master, can get confusing.<br>
<br>
In these places,<br>
Matthew 22:44,<br>
Luke 20: 42 and 43,<br>
Mark 12:36,<br>
Acts 2: 34 and 35,<br>
Hebrews 10:13, and in<br>
Hebrews 1:13,<br>
all of these New Testament verses are either quoting or referencing what is found in Psalms 110:1.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 110:1 (KJV)<br>
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.<br>
<br>
Since this is a psalm of David,<br>
If we fix this, it would make more sense if we understand it like this...<br>
David is calling Jesus His Master. David is saying, Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw is my Master.<br>
David heard the Father say unto His son,<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah said unto my Master, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.<br>
<br>
And we know that it is the Beloved Son Jesus that sits at Father Yaw-Who-Wah's right hand.<br>
So, it's like, David heard Heavenly Father Yaw-Who-Wah, say to His son, Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
<br>
"Sit right here at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."<br>
<br>
David calls the Messiah his Master.<br>
Jesus is Master.<br>
Jesus is Lord.<br>
Is Jesus your Master?<br>
<br>
<br>
If you get confused a bit, it's OK.<br>
Jesus is Lord<br>
Jesus is Master<br>
So, you can call Him Lord Jesus,<br>
Master Jesus<br>
and since The Lord is also sometimes referring to the Heavenly Father,<br>
you can get it mixed-up and still be OK.<br>
Lord Jesus<br>
Lord Yaw-Who-Shaw<br>
and The Lord's actual name is Yaw-Who-Wah<br>
so, instead of saying and praying,<br>
Lord Jesus<br>
Master Jesus<br>
you can still be OK if you say<br>
Lord Yaw-Who-Wah Jesus Yaw-Who-Shaw<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw<br>
When you talk and pray to the Father, His son is sitting right there, next to Him anyway.<br>
When you talk and pray to Jesus, His Father is sitting right there, next to Him anyway.<br>
The Son is the Father's right-hand man!<br>
They are both there, in the Kingdom, side-by-side, working together as a Father and Son team!<br>
<br>
John 10:30 (NLT)<br>
The Father and I are one.<br>
<br>
John 17:21 (NLT)<br>
I pray that they will all be one, just as you and I are one -- as you are in me, Father, and I am in you. And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me.<br>
<br>
John 14:10 (NLT)<br>
Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?<br>
The words I speak are not my own, but my Father who lives in me does his work through me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the ancient Hebrew language, the J used to be a Y sound, and the V used to be a W sound.<br>
<br>
1. Take the word, Jehovah<br>
the J used to be a Y sound, and the V used to be a W sound.<br>
<br>
2. remove the vowel letters.<br>
Jehovah<br>
J_h_v_h<br>
the J used to be a Y sound, and the V used to be a W sound.<br>
Change the J to a Y and change the V to a W.<br>
<br>
3.<br>
J_h_v_h<br>
Y_h_w_h<br>
<br>
<br>
4.<br>
Now put those exact same vowel letters back into the word, and you get<br>
Yehowah<br>
<br>
and you get, Yaw-Who-Wah, which is the proper name of The Lord.<br>
Yaw-Weh, Yah-Way, YHWH, Jehovah, The LORD, is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 3: 13-15 -- TS2009<br>
13 And Mosheh (Moe-Shay) said to Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem), "See, when I come to the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) and say to them, 'The Elohim of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they say to me, 'What is His Name?' what shall I say to them?"<br>
14 And Elohim said to Mosheh, "I am that which I am." And He said, "Thus you shall say to the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), 'I am has sent me to you.' "<br>
15 And Elohim said further to Mosheh, "Thus you are to say to the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), 'Yaw-Who-Wah, Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Ah-Vrah-Hom, the Elohim of Yeet-Sock, and the Elohim of Yaw-Coab, has sent me to you. This is My Name forever, and this is My remembrance to all generations.'<br>

<br>
When our three eye-witness news reporters, Matthew, Mark and John, all tell us about when<br>
Jesus Walks on Water,<br>
all three of them have in their news report, the following detail about His Name, when Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, identifies Himself...<br>
<br>
Matthew 14:27 -- KJV<br>
But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.<br>
<br>
The NLT team does a deeper dive into the Greek, and they bring out and reveal the following detail seen in the Greek that was translated into English...<br>
Always read the NLT footnotes and margin notes when you read the NLT!<br>
Those notes are shown here in round brackets.<br>
<br>
Matthew 14:27 -- NLT<br>
But Jesus spoke to them at once. "Don't be afraid," he said.<br>
("Take courage. I am.")<br>
("Take courage. The 'I Am' is here.")<br>
"Take courage. I am here!"<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 14:27 -- TS2009<br>
But immediately Yaw-Who-Shaw spoke to them, saying, "Take courage, it is I, do not be afraid."<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 6:50 -- KJV<br>
For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.<br>
<br>
Mark 6:50 -- NLT<br>
They were all terrified when they saw him.<br>
But Jesus spoke to them at once. "Don't be afraid," he said.<br>
("Take courage. I am.")<br>
("Take courage. The 'I Am' is here.")<br>
"Take courage. I am here!"<br>
<br>
Mark 6:50 -- TS2009<br>
for they all saw Him and were troubled. And immediately He spoke to them and said to them, "Take courage, it is I. Do not be afraid."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6:20 -- KJV<br>
But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.<br>
<br>
John 6:20 -- NLT<br>
but he called out to them,<br>
("Don't be afraid. I am.")<br>
("Don't be afraid. The 'I Am' is here.")<br>
"Don't be afraid. I am here!"<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6:20 -- TS2009<br>
And He said to them, "It is I, do not be afraid."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 6: 2-9 -- KJV<br>
6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:<br>
6:3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.<br>
6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.<br>
6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.<br>
6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgements:<br>
6:7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.<br>
6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land,<br>
(concerning the which I did lift up my hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob;)<br>
concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.<br>
6:9 	And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel:<br>
but they hearkened not unto Moses<br>
(for shortness of spirit,)<br>
(for straitness of spirit,)<br>
for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word, El-Shaddai is pronounced, ELL-Shuh-Dye, and it means, God Almighty.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 6: 2-9 -- NLT<br>
2 And God said to Moses, "I am Yahweh -- 'the Lord.'<br>
(And God said to Moses, "I am Yaw-Who-Wah.)<br>
(And God said to Moses, "I am Yaw-Weh, Yah-Way, YHWH, Jehovah, The LORD, I am Yaw-Who-Wah.)<br>
3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El-Shaddai -- 'God Almighty' --<br>
(but I did not reveal my name, Yaw-Who-Wah, to them.)<br>
but I did not reveal my name, Yahweh, to them.<br>
4 And I reaffirmed my covenant with them. Under its terms, I promised to give them the land of Canaan, where they were living as foreigners.<br>
5 You can be sure that I have heard the groans of the people of Israel, who are now slaves to the Egyptians. And I am well aware of my covenant with them.<br>
6 "Therefore, say to the people of Israel: 'I am the Lord. I will free you from your oppression and will rescue you from your slavery in Egypt. I will redeem you with a powerful arm and great acts of judgement.<br>
7 I will claim you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God who has freed you from your oppression in Egypt.<br>
8 I will bring you into the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as your very own possession. I am the Lord!'"<br>
9 So Moses told the people of Israel what the Lord had said, but they refused to listen any more. They had become too discouraged by the brutality of their slavery.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Egypt, known in the Hebrew as Meets-Rye-EEm, is a picture of the world, being a slave to the world, with worldly enslavement and worldly addictions.<br>
Don't let the love of money make you a slave to the world and a slave to making money.<br>
Don't let money be your god.<br>
Don't do that.<br>
When The Lord has something to say to you, do not refuse to listen any more. Do not become discouraged by the brutality of your slavery.<br>
Leave the world, leave the addiction, leave the slavery, leave Egypt.<br>
He will rescue you from your slavery in Egypt.<br>
He will rescue you from your slavery to the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 6: 2-9 -- TS2009<br>
2 And Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem) spoke to Mosheh (Moe-Shay) and said to him, "I am Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
3 "And I appeared to Ah-Vrah-Hom, to Yeet-Sock, and to Yah-Coab, as ELL-Shuh-Dye. And by My Name, Yaw-Who-Wah, was I not known to them?<br>
4 "And I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Kenaan, the land of their sojournings, in which they have sojourned.<br>
5 "And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) whom the Mitsrites (Meets-Rites) (Egyptians) are enslaving, and I have remembered My covenant.<br>
6 Say, therefore, to the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), 'I am Yaw-Who-Wah, and I shall bring you out from under the burdens of the Mitsrites (Meets-Rites), and shall deliver you from their enslaving, and shall redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgements,"<br>
7 and shall take you as My people, and I shall be your Elohim. And you shall know that I am Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim who is bringing you out from under the burdens of the Mitsrites.<br>
8 'And I shall bring you into the land which I swore to give to Ah-Vrah-Hom, to Yeet-Sock, and to Yah-Coab, to give it to you as an inheritance. I am Yaw-Who-Wah.' "<br>
9 And Mosheh spoke thus to the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), but they did not listen to Mosheh, because of shortness of spirit, and from hard slavery.<br>
<br>

Revelation 13: Starting at Verse 9<br>
and we keep reading into Chapter 14,<br>
stopping at Verse 12 -- KJV<br>
13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.<br>
13:10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.<br>
13:11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.<br>
13:12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.<br>
13:13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,<br>
13:14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.<br>
(And he had power to give breath unto the image of the beast,)<br>
13:15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.<br>
<br>
13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,<br>
(to give a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:)<br>
to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:<br>
<br>
13:17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.<br>
13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.<br>
14:1 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.<br>
14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:<br>
14:3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.<br>
<br>
14:4 These are they which were not defiled with women;<br>
for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.<br>
(These were bought from amongst men,)<br>
These were redeemed from amongst men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.<br>
<br>
14:5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.<br>
14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,<br>
14:7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgement is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.<br>
14:8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.<br>
14:9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,<br>
14:10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:<br>
14:11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.<br>
14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Verse 9 tells us that you have to do three things to make yourself go to hell.<br>
1. worship the beast,<br>
2. worship his image,<br>
3. receive his mark in your forehead, or in your hand.<br>
<br>
Just receiving the mark does not force you to go to hell. You have to also worship the beast and his image.<br>
If you have received his mark, but you have not yet worshipped the beast and his image, can the mark be removed or taken out of you?<br>
Does the mark make you want to worship the beast and his image?<br>
If you have a desire to worship the beast and his image, does that make you want to get the mark?<br>
The Bible does not answer these questions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 13: Starting at Verse 9<br>
and we keep reading into Chapter 14,<br>
stopping at Verse 12 -- NLT<br>
9 Anyone with ears to hear<br>
should listen and understand.<br>
10 Anyone who is destined for prison<br>
will be taken to prison.<br>
Anyone destined to die by the sword<br>
will die by the sword.<br>
This means that God's holy people must endure persecution patiently and remain faithful.<br>
11 Then I saw another beast come up out of the earth. He had two horns like those of a lamb, but he spoke with the voice of a dragon.<br>
12 He exercised all the authority of the first beast. And he required all the earth and its people to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.<br>
13 He did astounding miracles, even making fire flash down to earth from the sky whilst everyone was watching.<br>
14 And with all the miracles he was allowed to perform on behalf of the first beast, he deceived all the people who belong to this world. He ordered the people to make a great statue of the first beast, who was fatally wounded and then came back to life.<br>
15 He was then permitted to give life to this statue so that it could speak. Then the statue of the beast commanded that anyone refusing to worship it must die.<br>
16 He required everyone -- small and great, rich and poor, free and slave -- to be given a mark on the right hand or on the forehead.<br>
17 And no one could buy or sell anything without that mark, which was either the name of the beast or the number representing his name.<br>
18 Wisdom is needed here. Let the one with understanding solve the meaning of the number of the beast,<br>
(for it is the number of of humanity.)<br>
for it is the number of a man. His number is 666.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Some wrong Bible translations have said that His number is 616.<br>
If you see in your translation, the number there in Verse 18 being 616, you should stop using that translation.<br>
Some Bible translations were made to be wrong on purpose.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Then I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.<br>
2 And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of mighty ocean waves or the rolling of loud thunder. It was like the sound of many harpists playing together.<br>
3 This great choir sang a wonderful new song in front of the throne of God and before the four living beings and the twenty-four elders. No one could learn this song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.<br>
<br>
(They are virgins who have not defiled themselves with women.)<br>
4 They have kept themselves as pure as virgins, following the Lamb wherever he goes.<br>
(They have been purchased from amongst the people on the earth as first-fruits to God and to the Lamb.)<br>
They have been purchased from amongst the people on the earth as a special offering to God and to the Lamb.<br>
5 They have told no lies; they are without blame.<br>
6 And I saw another angel flying through the sky, carrying the eternal Good News to proclaim to the people who belong to this world -- to every nation, tribe, language, and people.<br>
7 "Fear God," he shouted. "Give glory to him. For the time has come when he will sit as judge. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all the springs of water."<br>
8 Then another angel followed him through the sky, shouting, "Babylon is fallen -- that great city is fallen -- because she made all the nations of the world drink the wine of her passionate immorality."<br>
9 Then a third angel followed them, shouting, "Anyone who worships the beast and his statue or who accepts his mark on the forehead or on the hand<br>
10 must drink the wine of God's anger. It has been poured full strength into God's cup of wrath. And they will be tormented with fire and burning sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb.<br>
11 The smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or night, for they have worshipped the beast and his statue and have accepted the mark of his name."<br>
12 This means that God's holy people must endure persecution patiently, obeying his commands and maintaining their faith in Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 13 is referencing many things in Daniel Chapter 7.<br>
<br>
Revelation 13: Starting at Verse 9<br>
and we keep reading into Chapter 14,<br>
stopping at Verse 12 -- TS2009<br>
9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear.<br>
10 He who brings into captivity shall go into captivity, he who kills with the sword has to be killed with the sword.<br>
(This is referring to Jeremiah 15:2 and Jeremiah 43:11.)<br>
Here is the endurance and the belief of the set-apart ones.<br>
<br>
11 And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.<br>
12 And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.<br>
13 And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from the heaven on the earth before men.<br>
14 And he leads astray those dwelling on the earth because of those signs which he was given to do before the beast, saying to those dwelling on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword, yet lived.<br>
15 And there was given to him to give spirit to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause to be killed as many as would not worship the image of the beast.<br>
16 And he causes all, both small and great, and rich and poor, and free and slave, to be given a mark upon their right hand or upon their foreheads,<br>
17 and that no one should be able to buy or sell except he that has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.<br>
18 Here is the wisdom! He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty six.<br>
<br>
1 And I looked and saw a Lamb standing on Mount Tsiyon, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand,<br>
(having His Name and His Father's Name written upon their foreheads.)<br>
having His Father's Name written upon their foreheads.<br>
<br>
2 And I heard a voice out of the heaven, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder, and I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps.<br>
3 And they sang a renewed song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders. And no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth.<br>
4 They are those who were not defiled with women, for they are maidens. They are those following the Lamb wherever He leads them on. They were redeemed from amongst men, being first-fruits to Elohim and to the Lamb.<br>
5 And in their mouth was found no falsehood, for they are blameless before the throne of Elohim.<br>
6 And I saw another messenger flying in mid-heaven, holding the everlasting Good News to announce to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,<br>
7 saying with a loud voice, "Fear Elohim and give esteem to Him, because the hour of His judgement has come. And worship Him who made the heaven and the earth, and sea, and fountains of water."<br>
<br>
8 And another messenger followed, saying, "Babel is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her whoring."<br>
(This is referring to Isaiah 21:9 and Jeremiah 51:8.)<br>
<br>
9 And a third messenger followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark upon his forehead or upon his hand,<br>
10 he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of Elohim, which is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath. And he shall be tortured with fire and sulphur before the set-apart messengers and before the Lamb.<br>
11 "And the smoke of their torture goes up forever and ever. And they have no rest day or night, those worshipping the beast and his image, also if anyone receives the mark of his name."<br>
12 Here is the endurance of the set-apart ones, here are those guarding the commands of Elohim and the belief of Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And that is the end of this Bible study.<br>
How do you get patience?<br>
How do you get endurance?<br>
How do you endure persecution patiently?<br>
Obey the Torah of the Father Yaw-Who-Wah, and have belief and faith in His Son Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>
You must be doing both!<br>
Are you doing both?<br>

Commentary:<br>
Are there some newer English translations that are ever so slightly, ever so subtly, trying to degrade, diminish, depreciate, and slightly pollute and defile the Scriptures?<br>
Are they trying to reduce the quality and clarity of what the Bible says?<br>
Are there some newer English translations that are trying to remove, just a little bit, the power in the blood?<br>
Are they trying to reduce the quality and clarity that the universe is owned by the One who created it in six days?<br>
Are there some newer English translations that are changing these verses, trying to dilute the blood, by reducing its purity, its strength, its glory and power?<br>
<br>
Are there some newer English translations that are changing these verses, trying to fog up and blur up the clarity of the six-day creation, done in six days by the only wise Creator of the Universe?<br>
<br>
See if you can detect what they are changing and doing, by comparing the KJV with the NLT and the TS2009.<br>
<br>
Most of these verses seem to be OK in the comparison that we will do here next.<br>
These particular verses are usually vulnerable places that get corrupted in some modern English Bible translations.<br>
To see if a particular translation is getting corrupted, changed, diluted or slightly polluted, these are good verses to examine as being vulnerable to potential corruption.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the truth.<br>
He saved us and He washed us from our sins, only through his blood, in his blood, the innocent blood.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
through his blood<br>
<br>
Colossians 1: 12-14 -- KJV<br>
1:12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:<br>
1:13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:<br>
(hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love:)<br>
1:14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:<br>
<br>
Colossians 1: 11-14 -- NLT<br>
...May you be filled with joy,<br>
(May you be filled with all the patience and endurance you need with joy,)<br>
12 always thanking the Father. He has enabled you to share in the inheritance that belongs to his people, who live in the light.<br>
13 For he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and transferred us into the Kingdom of his dear Son,<br>
14 who purchased our freedom (with his blood) and forgave our sins.<br>
<br>
Colossians 1: 12-14 -- TS2009<br>
12 giving thanks to the Father who has made us fit to share in the inheritance of the set-apart ones in the light,<br>
13 who has delivered us from the authority of darkness and transferred us into the reign of the Son of His love,<br>
14 in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,<br>
<br>
<br>
in his blood<br>
<br>
Romans 3: 24 & 25 -- KJV<br>
3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:<br>
(Whom God hath foreordained to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the passing over of sins that are past,)<br>
3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<br>
<br>
Romans 3: 24 & 25 -- NLT<br>
24 Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins.<br>
25 For God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life, shedding his blood. This sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past,<br>
<br>
Romans 3: 24 & 25 -- TS2009<br>
24 being declared right, without paying, by His favour through the redemption which is in Messiah Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
25 whom Elohim set forth as an atonement, through belief in His blood, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His tolerance Elohim had passed over the sins that had taken place before,<br>
<br>
<br>
the innocent blood<br>
<br>
Matthew 27: 3 & 4 -- KJV<br>
27:3 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,<br>
27:4 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.<br>
<br>
Matthew 27: 3 & 4 -- NLT<br>
3 When Judas, who had betrayed him, realised that Jesus had been condemned to die, he was filled with remorse. So he took the thirty pieces of silver back to the leading priests and the elders.<br>
4 "I have sinned," he declared, "for I have betrayed an innocent man."<br>
"What do we care?" they retorted. "That's your problem."<br>
<br>
Matthew 27: 3 & 4 -- TS2009<br>
3 Then Yeh-Who-Duh (Judas) – he who delivered Him up – having seen that He had been condemned, repented, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and to the elders,<br>
4 saying, "I have sinned in delivering up innocent blood." And they said, "What is that to us? You see to it!"<br>
<br>
<br>
washed us from our sins<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:5 -- KJV<br>
And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:5 -- NLT<br>
and from Jesus Christ. He is the faithful witness to these things, the first to rise from the dead, and the ruler of all the kings of the world.<br>
All glory to him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by shedding his blood for us.<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:5 -- TS2009<br>
and from Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck, the trustworthy witness, the first-born from the dead, and the ruler of the sovereigns of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,<br>
<br>
<br>
in my blood<br>
<br>
Luke 22:20 -- KJV<br>
Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.<br>
<br>
Luke 22:20 -- NLT<br>
After supper he took another cup of wine and said, "This cup is the new covenant between God and his people -- an agreement confirmed with my blood, which is poured out as a sacrifice for you.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When we now read in the TS2009, we will be changing the word, renewed, to the word, new, in the TS2009, due to a translation mistake in the TS2009.<br>
<br>
Luke 22:20 -- TS2009<br>
Likewise the cup also, after supper, saying, "This cup is the (new) covenant in My blood which is shed for you.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Although I generally do like to sometimes share from the Eth Cepher and The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009),<br>
in September of 2023, we sadly discovered a series of fatal mistakes in these two English translations.<br>
They both seem to think that the word, New, and the word, Renewed, are the same thing.<br>
Where we should only see the word, New, they have changed it to, Renewed, which is an absolute lie from the pit of hell.<br>
This sad and serious mistake just confirms and verifies that, there is no such thing as a perfect English translation.<br>
This commentary is repeated in Christian Essays 1,<br>
in the area that talks about<br>
Communion<br>
and in Christian Essays 21,<br>
in the Bible study, titled,<br>
Old Covenant, New Covenant.<br>
Commentary:<br>
The second section, towards the back of the book, are the books of the New Testament, which consist of the remaining 27 books of the Bible.<br>
The books of the New Testament, are in the second, back section of your Bible.<br>
It is called, the New Testament. It is not called, the renewed Testament.<br>
Jesus came here to make and confirm a new covenant, not a renewed covenant.<br>
Do you think there would be any difference in the quality, between buying a new home, and buying a renewed home?<br>
Do you think there would be any difference in the quality, between buying a new vehicle, and buying a renewed vehicle?<br>
<br>
The saved believers will live forever in the kingdom of heaven, which is called, the new Jerusalem.<br>
It is not called, the renewed Jerusalem.<br>
The book of Revelation, is in the New Testament; it is not in the renewed Testament.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The first day<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 1:5 -- KJV<br>
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.<br>
(And the evening was, and the morning was the first day.)<br>
<br>
Genesis 1:5 -- NLT<br>
God called the light "day" and the darkness "night."<br>
And evening passed and morning came, marking the first day.<br>
<br>
Genesis 1:5 -- TS2009<br>
And Elohim called the light 'day' and the darkness He called 'night.' And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, one day.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The TS2009 has made a mistake, again. It was not any day, it was not one day, it was, the first day.<br>
This may have been changed to be wrong on purpose to support the satanic lie of the theory of evolution.<br>
The first day clearly verifies that there was a Creator that created all creations in six days.<br>
This is a satanic demonstration of how newer English Bibles are being made wrong and corrupt on purpose.<br>
This sad and serious mistake just confirms and verifies that, there is no such thing as a perfect English translation.<br>

Colossians 2: 6-8 NLT<br>
6 And now, just as you accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord, you must continue to follow him.<br>
7 Let your roots grow down into him, and let your lives be built on him. Then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught, and you will overflow with thankfulness.<br>
8 Don't let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense that come from human thinking (and from the spiritual principles of this world,) and from the spiritual powers of this world, rather than from Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 2: 6-8 KJV<br>
2:6 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:<br>
2:7 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.<br>
2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
I lace the boots up, it's straight to the door<br>
'Cause this, is worth fighting for<br>
I get my head right, the heart's gotta follow<br>
Whisper a prayer like there ain't no tomorrow<br>
Take a breath, and I exhale slow<br>
I wasn't made for this kind of cold<br>
This ain't the kind of place that you wanna know<br>
These are the elements, I'm telling you bro<br>
This world, is up in my grill<br>
This world, is shooting to kill<br>
This world always gotta be stealing my heart<br>
This world always tryin' to rip my family apart (apart, apart, apart)<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll fight the elements (elements, elements, elements)<br>

I'ma goin' down swinging, if I go down<br>
I'ma goin' down swinging, if I go down<br>
<br>
<br>
This ain't our home, nah, not even close<br>
They camouflage like we're fighting some ghost<br>
You start to doubt everything that you know<br>
I feel the heat and it's starting to show<br>
They try to break us, break us, make us wanna give in<br>
Lay down our arms, Novocain us again<br>
Lay down a fight, I could never relent<br>
And I'mma take it all the way to the end<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll fight the elements (elements, elements, elements)<br>

Robin Mark was known to be one of the worship leaders at his home church, Christian Fellowship Church (CFC) in East Belfast.<br>
His first album was released in 1990.<br>
<br>
As of July of 2024, Robin Mark had released 10 studio albums, 12 live album recordings, and 3 Compilation albums.<br>
<br>
He had even recently released three single songs on 19 March 2023, available together as a digital download, known as, Conversations with the Father.<br>
<br>
<br>
I wanted to share with you two songs from his fifth studio album, titled, Sanctuary, which came out in the year 2000.<br>
<br>
It was in the summer of 2004 when I happened across a British Christian Radio Network that played this first song to me.<br>
<br>
It was called, This Is The Day (6:30am) from Robin Mark. It was the first Christian song that seem to deeply touch my heart, and ministered to me deeply.<br>
It made me want to start collecting Christian music, and to pay close attention to the Christian Music in England.<br>
<br>
<br>
Back in Chapter Zero, when we had reached random Bible verse 501, we did a Bible Study about times and seasons.<br>
That Bible study was originally inspired by this song, especially when he sings,<br>
<br>
That this is the day that the Lord has made<br>
They were meant to rejoice and be glad in it<br>
For the times and the seasons<br>
Are in Your hands<br>
But they don't even know.<br>
<br>
We saw in that study<br>
in Psalms 31:15, and in Psalms 62:8...<br>
My times are in thy hand. (Our times are in His hands.)<br>
<br>
Another thing we saw in that study was,<br>
John 15:15 (KJV) Jesus said...<br>
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 17:17 (KJV)<br>
A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.<br>
Proverbs 17:17 -- NLT:<br>
A friend is always loyal, and a brother is born to help in time of need.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Jesus is your friend, and a friend loves you at all times, and in all seasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
From the year 2000, from Robin Mark's album, Sanctuary, here are the words to the song, This Is The Day (6:30am), by Robin Mark...<br>
<br>
<br>
It's 6:30 am, sun rises on the city again,<br>
And hands reach over<br>
From the bedclothes warm,<br>
And punch that button on that stupid alarm,<br>
And a baby starts to cry<br>
And the coffee goes on,<br>
But they don't even know:<br>
<br>
<br>
That this is the day that the Lord has made<br>
They were meant to rejoice and be glad in it<br>
For the times and the seasons<br>
Are in Your hands<br>
But they don't even know.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's 8:30 am, they're walking off to school again,<br>
With an angel at their shoulder<br>
And a pocket full of hope,<br>
And a natural resistance determined to cope,<br>
With whatever lies before them<br>
On the slippery slope<br>
But they don't even know:<br>
<br>
<br>
That this is the day that the Lord has made<br>
They were meant to rejoice and be glad in it<br>
For the times and the seasons<br>
Are in Your hands<br>
But they don't even know.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's 5:30pm, they're all sitting down to eat again,<br>
She's a single young mother,<br>
He's a noisy child,<br>
He's a lonely lost father who's forgotten his smile,<br>
They're a family in trouble,<br>
But they're gonna get by<br>
They don't even know:<br>
<br>
<br>
It's 10:30 pm, sunset upon this city again,<br>
It's a circle of life<br>
On a dead end train,<br>
Is it just another morning with some more of the same?<br>
Shouldn't somebody be singing,<br>
A simple refrain<br>
So that they might even know?<br>
<br>
<br>
That this is the day that the Lord has made<br>
They were meant to rejoice and be glad in it<br>
For the times and the seasons<br>
Are in Your hands<br>
But they don't even know.<br>
<br>
<br>
That this is the day that the Lord has made<br>
They were meant to rejoice and be glad in it<br>
For the times and the seasons<br>
Are in Your hands<br>
But they don't even know.<br>
<br>
<br>
That this is the day that the Lord has made<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another interesting song from Robin Mark's album, Sanctuary,<br>
<br>
Is the track, titled, Men Of A Certain Age.<br>
<br>
From the year 2000, here are the lyrics to the song, Men Of A Certain Age, by Robin Mark<br>
<br>
<br>
Alright,<br>
Play.<br>
<br>
Men of a certain age are weary<br>
Everything rolls along<br>
Nothing has changed for 30 years now<br>
It's still the same old song<br>
<br>
<br>
Apathy for your anger<br>
And compromise replaced your rage<br>
Things you once stood for<br>
Now you stay seated<br>
Men of a certain age<br>
<br>
<br>
And men of a certain age are grumpy<br>
Nothing has turned out right<br>
All of those things you hoped to accomplish<br>
Seem to be set aside<br>
<br>
<br>
Where is that great adventure?<br>
How can I turn the page?<br>
Oh, rub it all out and start it over<br>
Men of a certain age<br>
<br>
<br>
But who told you to quit?<br>
Who said to step down?<br>
Who said to stop running?<br>
Who said that time had been called on your day?<br>
Who said the anointing had been taken away?<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, the battle is won, the kingdom is come<br>
It's time to start running<br>
So pick up that baton and get back in the race<br>
Men of a certain age<br>
<br>
<br>
Men of a certain age are heroes<br>
At least in their children's eyes<br>
Standing for what they once believed in<br>
No hint of compromise<br>
<br>
<br>
Running the race with patience<br>
Until their final day<br>
Oh, faithful in every word and deed<br>
You men of a certain age<br>
<br>
<br>
For who told you to quit?<br>
Who said to step down?<br>
Who said to stop running?<br>
Who said that time had been called on your day?<br>
Who said the anointing had been taken away?<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, the battle is won, the kingdom is come<br>
It's time to start running<br>
So pick up that baton and get back in the race<br>
Men of a certain age<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, pick up that baton and get back in the race<br>
Men of a certain age<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Margin notes and footnotes will be included as we read here.<br>
Those extra notes will be in round brackets.<br>
<br>
If you hear or read a sentence being repeated,<br>
but there was a word or two changed in the sentence,<br>
that will be us getting a better understanding of what is going on in that verse,<br>
by including that information coming to us from the KJV and NLT margin notes and footnotes.<br>
Again, if you can see the text, those notes will be enclosed in round brackets,<br>
also known as parenthesis.<br>
<br>
This can be very interesting.<br>
Many of the KJV Bibles no longer include the KJV margin notes and footnotes.<br>
The reading of the margin notes and footnotes is something that we try to do in all of our Bible studies.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The year is<br>
4004 BC. This year is<br>
about 4000 years before Jesus Christ was born.<br>
4004 BC is a year that happened over six thousand years ago.<br>
4004 BC is the year that many calculate and estimate as the year<br>
when the events of Genesis Chapter 1 took place.<br>
<br>
We will now read and study<br>
Genesis Chapter 1, all of Chapter 1, all 31 verses,<br>
and then we keep reading into chapter 2,<br>
stopping when we get to Genesis 2, verse 9 -- KJV<br>
1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.<br>
1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.<br>
1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.<br>
<br>
1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.<br>
(and God divided between the light and between the darkness. )<br>
1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.<br>
(And the evening was, and the morning was the first day.)<br>
1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.<br>
(And God made the expansion, and divided the waters which were under the expansion from the waters which were above the expansion: and it was so.)<br>
1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.<br>
1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.<br>
1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.<br>
<br>
1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.<br>
<br>
1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, (tender grass,) the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.<br>
<br>
1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
<br>
1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.<br>
(And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide between the day and between the night;)<br>
1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:<br>
<br>
1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.<br>
(And God made two great lights; the greater light for the rule of the day, and the lesser light to rule the night)<br>
1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.<br>
<br>
1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,<br>
<br>
1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.<br>
1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.<br>
(And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the creeping creature that hath soul, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the face of the firmament of heaven.)<br>
1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.<br>
<br>
1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
<br>
1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.<br>
1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.<br>
1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.<br>
1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>
1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<br>
<br>
1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.<br>
<br>
1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it:<br>
and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.<br>
(and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.)<br>
(And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb seeding seed,)<br>
1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.<br>
<br>
1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth,<br>
(wherein there is a living soul,)<br>
wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.<br>
<br>
1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.<br>
2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.<br>
2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.<br>
<br>
2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.<br>
(because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created to make.)<br>
2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,<br>
<br>
2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.<br>
(a mist which went up from the earth watered the whole face of the ground.)<br>
2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.<br>
(And the LORD God formed man dust of the ground,)<br>
2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.<br>
<br>
2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.<br>
2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis Chapter 1, all of Chapter 1, all 31 verses,<br>
and then we keep reading into chapter 2,<br>
stopping when we get to Genesis 2, verse 9 -- NLT<br>
1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br>
(When God began to create the heavens and the earth,)<br>
2 The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.<br>
3 Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.<br>
4 And God saw that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness.<br>
5 God called the light "day" and the darkness "night."<br>
And evening passed and morning came, marking the first day.<br>
6 Then God said, "Let there be a space between the waters, to separate the waters of the heavens from the waters of the earth."<br>
7 And that is what happened. God made this space to separate the waters of the earth from the waters of the heavens.<br>
8 God called the space "sky."<br>
And evening passed and morning came, marking the second day.<br>
9 Then God said, "Let the waters beneath the sky flow together into one place, so dry ground may appear." And that is what happened.<br>
10 God called the dry ground "land" and the waters "seas." And God saw that it was good.<br>
11 Then God said, "Let the land sprout with vegetation -- every sort of seed-bearing plant, and trees that grow seed-bearing fruit. These seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came." And that is what happened.<br>
12 The land produced vegetation -- all sorts of seed-bearing plants, and trees with seed-bearing fruit. Their seeds produced plants and trees of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.<br>
13 And evening passed and morning came, marking the third day.<br>
14 Then God said, "Let lights appear in the sky to separate the day from the night. Let them be signs to mark the seasons, days, and years.<br>
15 Let these lights in the sky shine down on the earth." And that is what happened.<br>
16 God made two great lights -- the larger one to govern the day, and the smaller one to govern the night. He also made the stars.<br>
17 God set these lights in the sky to light the earth,<br>
18 to govern the day and night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.<br>
19 And evening passed and morning came, marking the fourth day.<br>
20 Then God said, "Let the waters swarm with fish and other life. Let the skies be filled with birds of every kind."<br>
21 So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that scurries and swarms in the water, and every sort of bird -- each producing offspring of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.<br>
22 Then God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply. Let the fish fill the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth."<br>
23 And evening passed and morning came, marking the fifth day.<br>
24 Then God said, "Let the earth produce every sort of animal, each producing offspring of the same kind -- livestock, small animals that scurry along the ground, and wild animals." And that is what happened.<br>
25 God made all sorts of wild animals, livestock, and small animals, each able to produce offspring of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.<br>
<br>
(Then God said, "Let us make Ah-Dome in our image, to be like us.)<br>
(Then God said, "Let us make adam in our image, to be like us.)<br>
(Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, to be like us.)<br>
26 Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image, to be like us. They will reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock,<br>
(all the wild animals on all the earth,)<br>
all the wild animals on the earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Hebrew word, Ha, would be the English word, The.<br>
If I say in Hebrew, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck, That would be Jesus Christ in English.<br>
If I say in Hebrew, Yaw-Who-Shaw Ha-Muh-She-Uck, That would be Jesus The Christ in English.<br>
If I say in Hebrew, Ah-Dome, That would be Adam in English. It means, Man. Ah-Dome simply means, man.<br>
If I say in Hebrew, Ha-Ah-Dome, That would be, The Adam. In English, The Adam, means, the man.<br>
God created the man in his own image.<br>
We will think about all of this as we read verse 27 here next.<br>
<br>
(So God created Ha-Ah-Dome in his own image.)<br>
(So God created the Adam in his own image.)<br>
(So God created the man in his own image.)<br>
27
So God created human beings in his own image.<br>
In the image of God he created them;<br>
male and female he created them.<br>
<br>
<br>
28 Then God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground."<br>
29 Then God said, "Look! I have given you every seed-bearing plant throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food.<br>
30 And I have given every green plant as food for all the wild animals, the birds in the sky, and the small animals that scurry along the ground -- everything that has life." And that is what happened.<br>
31 Then God looked over all he had made, and he saw that it was very good!<br>
And evening passed and morning came, marking the sixth day.<br>
1 So the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything in them was completed.<br>
<br>
(On the seventh day God had finished his work of creation, so he ceased from all his work.)<br>
2 On the seventh day God had finished his work of creation, so he rested from all his work.<br>
3 And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, because it was the day when he rested from all his work of creation.<br>
4 This is the account of the creation of the heavens and the earth.<br>
When the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,<br>
5 neither wild plants nor grains were growing on the earth. For the Lord God had not yet sent rain to water the earth, and there were no people to cultivate the soil.<br>
<br>
(Instead, mist came up from the ground and watered all the land.)<br>
6 Instead, springs came up from the ground and watered all the land.<br>
7 Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground. He breathed the breath of life into the man's nostrils, and the man became a living person.<br>
8 Then the Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east, and there he placed the man he had made.<br>
9 The Lord God made all sorts of trees grow up from the ground -- trees that were beautiful and that produced delicious fruit. In the middle of the garden he placed the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<br>

<br>
Commentary:<br>
On the morning of Monday, the 23rd of December 2024, my 24-year-old daughter shared with me and my wife something very interesting. The night before, she was thinking about Genesis Chapter 1 and the six days of Creation. As she was laying in bed, meditating on those verses, a very interesting revelation came to her. She describes it as some kind of revelation or vision about the six days of creation and the seventh day of rest.  She had received two divine and interesting perspectives. One insight is how this can also be a kind of road map or growth chart of the journey that one may travel as one goes from being a not-saved unbeliever, to becoming a saved believer, helping and ministering to others, and then eventually going to heaven. The following is a commentary of my daughter describing this insightful concept.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Genesis Chapter 1.<br>
The revelation of Genesis Chapter 1 is two-fold. Day 1. As a believer being not born again, we are void. We are dead in sin. That is verse 2. And then, Yaw-Who-Wah says "let there be light" --in verse 3 -- and we are born again into a new creature in Yaw-Who-Shaw. Out of the darkness, into the light.<br>
<br>
Then, in verse 6, He commands the waters of life be given to us, by the Roo-Awk Hawk-Oh-Desh, and like the firmament, in verse 7, He covers us. That is the second day.<br>
<br>
The third day, in verses 9 and 10, He commands dry land to appear, and, in verse 11 and 12, He commands the fruits of the Spirit to be planted into us, to bring forth its fruit in its season. And, that's the third day.<br>
<br>
The fourth day, verse 14, He gives us the gifts of the Spirit, as signs, miracles, wisdom and knowledge, and understanding. And in verse 18, He also uses it to divide the light from the darkness. He sets us apart. He makes us Holy, Kah-Doesh.<br>
<br>
In verse 20, He brings forth creatures. The living waters that we have been given, the living water, that if, we drink of this, we shall never be thirsty again, we give those living waters to people around us. That is when we starting fishing for men. We can't teach someone if we don't understand the subject. He gives us understanding so that we can become fishers of men.<br>
<br>
Here is now the fifth day. The birds can represent the people that soar above the world. The believers are soaring high like wings of eagles. They are being above and not beneath. (Deuteronomy 28:13) You can be a resting place for the fellow believers. We can give refreshment to other believers through works and prayers and being together in fellowship. That is the end of the fifth day.<br>
<br>
Now, the sixth day, is when we have gone out to the people, to every living creature, any form of human, 100 per cent, or not so much, every creature, in the earth, which is the world. We go there, and, we preach to them also, even if they do not accept it, we are there anyway, we are a light to a world. We are the light that was given to us on the first day. And ELL-Low-Heem saw everything that we had done, and He saw and, behold, it was good.<br>
<br>
And finally, after this time is over, He creates us anew, in His image, pure and undefiled, and we are given dominion over all of the "fish, and "fowls", and "creatures" over all the earth; every living thing that moves upon the earth. And in the day that we are given that, after that, we are given the seventh day of rest, the millennial reign, the rest from work.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is now my daughter giving a second insight about how the days of creation can correspond to a baby growing and developing in a mother's womb.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Genesis Chapter 1 can also be a picture of the womb. The first two days are the first three months. In the beginning, the womb is dark and void, and then man and woman come together. The egg and sperm unite, and when the two cells unite, there is light. An arc of light occurs in the womb, and there is light, and there is life. Every two days each represent three months, only months 1 through 9. The 10th month, after pregnancy, is separate.<br>
<br>
Verse 6, let there be an expanse, the firmament, or placenta.  And let it divide the waters from the waters, let it divide the waters of the mother and the waters of the baby, the embryonic fluid. With the waters of the mother, there is a separation between the baby from the mother's body, and the baby's body. And then, ELL-Low-Heem said, Let the waters under the heavens, the mother, be gathered together under one place, and let dry land appear, the development of the body. And let the earth, which is the baby, bring forth grass, and herb-bearing seed, and trees. That is pointing to the development of the body of the baby, the self-replication of the DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA). The DNA replicates the fastest during the entire time of the baby being inside of the mother's womb.<br>
<br>
Days 3 and 4 are the fourth month, through the eighth month.<br>
<br>
As for verse 14, which talks about the sun, moon and stars, they are signs to give indications of times and seasons and months. This is when the mother can feel the baby for the first time. This is when the mother starts to receives signs and indications of life, and the movement of life, like the movement of the stars.<br>
<br>
The Eighth month is the fifth day. For the Fifth day, the baby is both in the water, like creatures of the sea, but is also suspended in the water, like the fowls of the air.  The waters, or the embryonic fluid, brought forth abundantly, and at the end of that day it says to multiply unto all the earth.<br>
<br>
The sixth day is the ninth month. On the sixth day is when the mother's womb breaks, and the water brings forth, the earth brings forth, into the air, into the earth, the baby.<br>
<br>
The seventh day is the tenth month, after pregnancy, a month of recovery. The seventh day is the day of rest. Not only is it the day of rest, it is also the recovery time for the mother and the child, having multiplied upon the earth.<br>

Silver Cord Prayer<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 12: 3-10 (KJV)<br>
12:3 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves,<br>
and the grinders cease because they are few,<br>
(and the grinders fail, because they grind little,)<br>
and those that look out of the windows be darkened,<br>
<br>
12:4 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;<br>
12:5 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:<br>
12:6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.<br>
12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.<br>
12:8 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.<br>
<br>
(And moreover, the more wise the preacher was, the more he taught the people knowledge;)<br>
12:9 And moreover, because the preacher was wise,<br>
he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.<br>
<br>
(The preacher sought to find out words of delight:)<br>
12:10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 12: 3-10 -- NLT<br>
3 Remember him before your legs -- the guards of your house -- start to tremble; and before your shoulders -- the strong men -- stoop. Remember him before your teeth -- your few remaining servants -- stop grinding; and before your eyes -- the women looking through the windows -- see dimly.<br>
4 Remember him before the door to life's opportunities is closed and the sound of work fades. Now you rise at the first chirping of the birds, but then all their sounds will grow faint.<br>
5 Remember him before you become fearful of falling and worry about danger in the streets; before your hair turns white like an almond tree in bloom, and you drag along without energy like a dying grasshopper, and the caperberry no longer inspires sexual desire. Remember him before you near the grave, your everlasting home, when the mourners will weep at your funeral.<br>
6 Yes, remember your Creator now whilst you are young, before the silver cord of life snaps and the golden bowl is broken. Don't wait until the water jar is smashed at the spring and the pulley is broken at the well.<br>
7 For then the dust will return to the earth, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.<br>
8 "Everything is meaningless," says the Teacher, "completely meaningless."<br>
9 Keep this in mind: The Teacher was considered wise, and he taught the people everything he knew. He listened carefully to many proverbs, studying and classifying them.<br>
10 The Teacher sought to find just the right words to express truths clearly.<br>
(The Teacher sought to write what was upright and true.)<br>

Commentary:<br>
Pastor Dave Bryan<br>
from the Church Of Glad Tidings, in Yuba City, California<br>
said some interesting words on the 3rd of April 2024<br>
and those words are captured in the video of the Isaiah 61 conference<br>
in Day 3, Session 6, in a video that was found on YouTube in August of 2024.<br>
<br>
Whilst his words are still fresh in my mind, allow me to paraphrase what<br>
Pastor Dave Bryan said in that video.<br>
<br>
I would normally just quote the words directly, but this video is eight hours long!<br>
That's right. This video is over eight hours long, so let me just remember what he<br>
basically said as I now try to paraphrase a few minutes from that conference video.<br>
<br>
My paraphrase will now begin like this.<br>
<br>
Amongst his many incredible and mind-blowing stories, he mentioned this.<br>
<br>
The Freemasons, are a satanic secret brotherhood.<br>
Some of their satanic rituals include having to shed and use innocent blood sacrifices<br>
in their satanic ritual. What they do is, if they want some kind of satanic power,<br>
they do a blood sacrifice in a ritual and they place a curse on their unborn offspring.<br>
<br>
They want power and success, financially.<br>
They want more power and success with starting and running their own business<br>
They want more power and success in their financial and worldly conditions.<br>
Their Freemason satanic sacrifice and ritual places a future<br>
multi-generation curse upon the firstborn of the descendants,<br>
especially targeting future firstborn sons.<br>
<br>
The Ten Commandments indicates that these are multi-generational curses, multi-generational sins...<br>
<br>
Exodus chapter 19, verse 5 -- KJV<br>
...visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me<br>
<br>
Exodus chapter 19, verse 5 -- NLT<br>
 ...I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected -- even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me.<br>
<br>
From the perspective of the firstborn son or firstborn child,<br>
it ends up being like this...<br>
<br>
When there is eventually a firstborn son, and sometimes a firstborn in general, son or daughter,<br>
the curse will bring in multi-generational curses and<br>
multi-generation sin, that will be a type of satanic attack<br>
or demonic attack, that usually will start attacking the firstborn son<br>
when that child reaches the "age of accountability."<br>
That age is not certain, and could be different for each child.<br>
The Bible suggests the age of 20. Some arguments or traditions may point to<br>
the age of 12. The unspecified age of accountability could be different for each person.<br>
That will be the year that the satanic attacks, sin attacks, and demonic attacks will<br>
start for that firstborn, all because a father, grandfather, great-grandfather,<br>
or even a great-great-grandfather was a Freemason and did satanic rituals to<br>
get more wealth, power and success, which results in multi-generation sins<br>
being passed down, along with multi-generational curses being passed down as well.<br>
<br>
It does not have to be exactly Freemasons. There are many different names of<br>
many different satanic secret brotherhoods, secret societies, and secret clubs that<br>
all do satanic curses and rituals that will impact future unborn, firstborn offspring,<br>
especially firstborn sons. If there is no firstborn son, the curse may wait until a descendant future mother<br>
eventually does give birth to a firstborn son,<br>
and then the curse waits for that firstborn son to reach the "age of accountability."<br>
<br>
<br>
And that is the end of remembering something paraphrased that was originally mentioned by<br>
Pastor Dave Bryan<br>
from the Church Of Glad Tidings, in Yuba City, California<br>
from a video of the Isaiah 61 conference on 3 April 2024<br>
in the video known as, Day 3, Session 6, that was found on YouTube in August of 2024.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
These are prayers from August of 2024, that come from, and are inspired by content provided by my daughter, and from<br>
Dave Bryan and Cheryl Bryan, from the Church Of Glad Tidings, in Yuba City, California.<br>
<br>
Here is a good prayer to pray, especially if you have been fasting before speaking out this prayer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let us pray right now.<br>
<br>
Heavenly Father, Yaw-Who-Wah, beloved Son, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck,<br>
<br>
May we be fasting whilst praying, for this prayer.<br>
May we receive all of the full power of this prayer by praying whilst fasting.<br>
May this prayer be fully and completely answered to its full and utmost effect by us praying whilst fasting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We pray against all Satanic Attacks, Satanic Ritual Attacks, Witchcraft Attacks, Magic Arts Attacks.<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out<br>
all family curses, all bloodline curses, all curses in the family bloodline, all curses in my family bloodline,<br>
All Curses, all cursing Attacks, all spells, all hexes, all satanic rituals, all satanic curses,<br>
all Satanic Attacks, Satanic Ritual Attacks, Witchcraft Attacks, Magic Arts Attacks, and all other forms of darkness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out<br>
Astral Projection -- cut and sever the silver cord of the one doing the Astral Projection.<br>
Cut the silver cord!<br>
Cut the silver cord right now! (Make that spirit "bounce.")<br>
If there is more than one near us, cut them all. Cut all of the silver cords!<br>
Make it so that the satanic spirit or those spirits are not able to go back to the body or bodies that they came from.<br>
Make the cuts be permanent and immediate.<br>
When any such spirits enter into our rooms that we are living in or sleeping in, you would cut the silver cords automatically and immediately.<br>
Whatever number of them that do this at any given moment, day or night, that would be the number of silver cords that you would cut, automatically and immediately.<br>
Only Yaw-Who-Wah's authorised angel army personnel are allowed to be with us.<br>
If anyone attempts to use Astral Projection to enter into our area where we live and sleep at night,<br>
or any other place that is anointed with the oil, and has been declared our place to gather in, live in and sleep in,<br>
may you immediately cut and sever the silver cord of the one doing the Astral Projection,<br>
and permanently cauterise and seal the severed ends of the silver cord with<br>
the blood of Yaw-Who-Shaw, so that it may never be re-connected or restored ever again.<br>
<br>
Do this also for the place or places where we gather together as believers in a holy assembly,<br>
in a set-apart convocation.<br>
<br>
Sever the silver cord of the spirit doing that Astral Projection so it can never return to the body that it came from.<br>
Make it so that the spirit doing that Astral Projection can never return to the body that it came from.<br>
Take away all power and authority from that spirit and send it to the dry places, or to a place where it can never return to us ever again.<br>
<br>
If any doorways, portals or gateways open in our place that we gather in, live in and sleep in,<br>
may you immediately and permanently shut those doorways, portals or gateways<br>
and go to the other end where they originated from and take away all power and authority so that<br>
the one that opened that up can never open that up ever again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out<br>
familiar spirits.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out<br>
generational spirits -- spirits that can jump between family members.<br>
Cause those spirits to no longer be able to jump amongst families and generations.<br>
<br>
<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out family spirits,<br>
evil, unclean spirits that have been staying in the family,<br>
generational sins, generational curses, generational entities that keep getting passed-down from generations to generations,<br>
from family members to family members.<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, break those curses, and cleanse<br>
and heal us -- In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, heal us and cleanse us from<br>
generationally attached entities, and all generational sin, and break all generational curses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out<br>
hindering spirits, and any other entities that try to hinder, distract, harm, disrupt, or cause confusion or<br>
try to hinder in any way the power and relationship that we have with the Father, and the Son, and the set-apart spirit,<br>
the sprit of the holy, the Roo-Awk Haw-Coh-Desh.<br>
<br>
<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out<br>
weakening spirits.<br>
<br>
<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out<br>
spirits of infirmity and spirits of weakness.<br>
<br>
Cast out all spirits of sickness, spirits that are causing pains and sickness,<br>
rebuke and cast out pain, diseases, infirmities, illness, infections, tumours, cancers,<br>
and heal all damages, deformities, injuries, malformations, and bring about healing, strengthening, and<br>
a restoration of your perfection, according to the perfect original creation design of a human man and woman,<br>
before it was corrupted.<br>
<br>
<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give us wisdom to pray and, in prayer,<br>
may we draw a bloodline.<br>
May this bloodline go completely and entirely around the perimeter of the designated premises.<br>
May it be a hedge of protection, safety and security,<br>
and may no satanic person be allowed to cross it.<br>
May it be a complete bloodline wall of protection, solid, with no gaps, or weak or missing areas at any area<br>
along the prayed perimeter of the designated premises, and along the drawing of this bloodline<br>
may it be a continued prayer as we prayer-walk and draw this line around this perimeter of the designated premises<br>
may this prayer-walk-around be a continual prayer,<br>
pleading the blood of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck, <br>
the power of the blood of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>
<br>
It has no segments, no missing gaps, and is a solid pleading of  the blood of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck,<br>
and may this bloodline become an impenetrable shield, wall, mighty fortress and strong tower of a wall,<br>
absolutely impenetrable --  a bloodline, the power of the blood of the new covenant<br>
with a height that goes infinitely above, and a depth that goes below, all the way down to the centre of the earth.<br>
May no satanic entity or person, in a body or not in a body be able to cross this bloodline<br>
in the name of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
May no satanic entity or person, engaged in doing<br>
Astral Projection<br>
be able to cross this bloodline<br>
in the name of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
This bloodline is a line drawn and is made of the power of the blood of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>
pleading the blood of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck,<br>
the power of the blood of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck,<br>
going infinity above and infinitely below, all the way to the centre of the earth,<br>
praying in the blood of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck<br>
as a bloodline going all around the entire perimeter of the designated premises<br>
of the place we have declared to be holy, set-apart and anointed<br>
with the spirit, with the presence and with the glory of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, all throughout this place.<br>
the power of the blood of Yaw-Who-Shaw shall be our hedge of protection, our shield, our strongest tower,<br>
and our mightiest fortress.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out<br>
thought-casting --<br>
detect when an evil thought-casting is trying to enter the mind of one of us believers.<br>
Locate the one sending the thought-casting and we pray against it.<br>
If any satanic person attempts thought-casting by any means,<br>
that we would know from where and from whom the thought-casting is coming from<br>
and In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out<br>
that entity or person, in a body or not in a body, cause their<br>
thought-casting to forever cease, and take away all of their satanic powers and authorities<br>
so that the entity or person will never ever be able to do any further thought-casting<br>
and may all of their powers and rituals and authorities be permanently removed from them<br>
and that all future attempts to try to do any kind of satanic ritual, or power, or magic or witchcraft of any kind<br>
be of absolutely no effect, and be completely impotent.<br>
<br>
Remove all the potency and all of the power and functionalities from all of their magic arts, and from all of their witchcrafts,<br>
making them completely impotent, completely paralysed and completely weak, unable to see, unable to hear, unable to stand, unable to walk,<br>
and unable to have any amount of continence. Sever their silver cord immediately and permanently.<br>
<br>
Strengthen your set-apart, elect ones, save them, heal them, provide for them, help them, guide them,<br>
give your set-apart, elect ones mercy, grace, your favour, your pity, your compassion, your salvation, forgiveness, love, joy, peace, truth, wisdom, understanding, patience,<br>

Galatians 5: 22 and 23 -- KJV<br>
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,<br>
longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness,<br>
temperance: against such there is no law.<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 22 and 23 -- NLT:<br>
But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives:<br>
love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,<br>
faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:8 -- KJV<br>
(The Whatsoever-Is List)<br>
Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,<br>
whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,<br>
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,<br>
whatsoever things are of good report;<br>
if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In just a moment we will have another Prayer for blocking thought-casting.<br>
<br>
If you are dealing with or struggling with<br>
wrong, evil thoughts,<br>
intrusive, sinful and negative thoughts,<br>
you can name and mention those thoughts in the blank areas indicated in the prayer that we will pray here in just a moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Examples of<br>
wrong, evil thoughts,<br>
intrusive, sinful and negative thoughts,<br>
can be found in the fruit of the flesh list.<br>
<br>
Fruit of the Flesh (a better name for this list would be, the Works of the Flesh.)<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 15-21 -- KJV<br>
15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.<br>
16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.<br>
17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.<br>
18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.<br>
19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,<br>
20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,<br>
21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 7-21 -- NLT<br>
7 You were running the race so well. Who has held you back from following the truth?<br>
8 It certainly isn't God, for he is the one who called you to freedom.<br>
9 This false teaching is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough!<br>
10 I am trusting the Lord to keep you from believing false teachings. God will judge that person, whoever he is, who has been confusing you.<br>
11 (Dear Brothers,) Dear brothers and sisters, if I were still preaching that you must be circumcised -- as some say I do -- why am I still being persecuted? If I were no longer preaching salvation through the cross of Christ, no one would be offended.<br>
12 I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would mutilate themselves.<br>
(I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would castrate themselves.)<br>
(I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would cut themselves off from you.)<br>
(I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would cut themselves off.)<br>
<br>
13 For you have been called to live in freedom, my brothers and sisters. But don't use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature. Instead, use your freedom to serve one another in love.<br>
14 For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbour as yourself." (quoting from Leviticus 19:18.)<br>
15 But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out! Beware of destroying one another.<br>
16 So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won't be doing what your sinful nature craves.<br>
17 The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions.<br>
18 But when you are directed by the Spirit, you are not under obligation to the law of Moses.<br>
19 When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures,<br>
20 idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarrelling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division,<br>
21 envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are dealing with or struggling with<br>
wrong, evil thoughts,<br>
intrusive, sinful and negative thoughts,<br>
you can name and mention those thoughts in the blank areas indicated in the prayer that we will pray here next.<br>
<br>
Here is another Prayer for blocking thought-casting.<br>
<br>
What is thought-casting?<br>
It is a satanic power, done by satanic people practising witchcraft.<br>
<br>
It can be done by mixing and blending knowledge and actions and rituals, all of which can be gathered from<br>
witchcraft, spells, magic, magic spells, hexes, curses, powers of darkness, science, medicine, technology, electronics,<br>
the secret technology embedded in smartphones, DNA Modification,<br>
nano-science, nano-technology delivered through injections, vaccinations, pharmaceutical science,<br>
prescription drug science, medications, medicines, satanic rituals,<br>
alchemy, potions, nutritional means with certain herbs, evil knowledge, forbidden, evil, secret knowledge taught by the fallen watchers,<br>
technology, transmissions from cell towers, transmissions from smart electric metres,<br>
4G, 5G, 6G and other cellular or broadcasting technologies,<br>
transmissions from satellites and drones, energy weapons, radio-frequency weapons,<br>
other frequency weapons, and directed energy weapons,<br>
shooting weapons that shoot evil medicines and nano-technologies,<br>
MK Ultra, brainwashing, military government programming,<br>
or any blend and mixture of any and all of these combined,<br>
grabbing parts and pieces from all of these kinds of sciences, and studies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thought casting is when something or someone puts thoughts into someone's mind to distract, to make them think something, to make them do something, etc., that the person would not normally think or do; wrong, evil thoughts that are harmful, shameful, not of the fruit of the Spirit, not Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness and Self control.<br>
<br>
In this next prayer, some of the Hebrew name spellings will be different, mainly based on the way how they are spelled in the Eth Cepher.<br>
Let us pray.<br>
<br>
Heavenly Father, I come to you because I recognise that I am having intrusive, sinful and negative thoughts that are not my own, and they are not welcome. The thoughts of  ___________  -- these thoughts are thoughts that plague my mind and move me far away from you. And I don't want them.<br>
<br>
In his holy, set-apart name, may Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, rebuke and cast out all of these wrong thoughts.<br>
<br>
I ask that you would remove the thoughts of _________  -- remove these wrong, evil thoughts, remove these<br>
intrusive, sinful and negative thoughts from my mind, body, and soul. And that you would close the gateways, and close the entrances of where and how these thoughts are coming into my life,<br>
even if it is caused by blood covenants or oaths from my ancestors, or corruption of my DNA, music, or technology, from trauma in my life, or intentional opening or compromise on my part.<br>
<br>
I ask that you would bring into my body, mind and soul, your seven fold Spirit of Yahuah, of Wisdom, understanding, council, Strength, Knowledge, and Awesome reverence of you Yahuah, that's in Isaiah 11:2. I want to recognise the attacks so I may reject them and stay in your love, and peace. For I know that I have been given a Rauch of Power, Love, and a Sound mind (as mentioned in 2 Timothy 1:7).<br>
<br>
I plead the perfect blood of Yahshua on my life.<br>
(And in the name and power that has been given to me by Jesus The Christ, Jesus The Messiah, Yaw-Who-Shaw Ha-Muh-She-Uck)<br>
<br>
And in the name and power that has been given to me by Yahshua Ha'messiah I command all entities, demons, Nephilim, fallen ones, creatures, witches and warlocks, or persons, to cease and desist with all attacks, on my body, mind and soul. And I cut all ties to them, whether it is from them casting a thought spell, from them having my DNA, an object, through sin, known and unknown, soul ties, the tie is now cut in the name of Yahshua. And I ask the blood of the lamb to be put in its place to heal, and remove what caused the breach. For the gateway, doorways, window openings to be closed and sealed by the blood of the lamb.<br>
<br>
I ask for the Rauch Ha'Qodesh, the fruit of the Spirit that is in Galatians 5:22-23, of Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness and Self control, to be what operates in my life. And I put on the full armour of Yah that I may withstand the evil. The armour of waist-belt of Truth, breastplate of Righteousness, shoes of the Good news of peace, shield of Faith, helmet of Salvation, and the sword of the Ruach which is the Word of Elohiym.<br>
<br>
  And I would also ask for me to know what caused the breach, if you want me to know, so I may not repeat it again whilst protecting me from further harm. Thank you Father Yah for giving me your Son, so that I may be set free, thank you for setting me free, and thank you for forgiving my sins, and thank you for the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of Yah to guide me into your light and truth.<br>
Amein.<br>
