Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

Zechariah 14: 13-17 -- NLT<br>
12 And the Lord will send a plague on all the nations that fought against Jerusalem. Their people will become like walking corpses, their flesh rotting away. Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.<br>
13 On that day they will be terrified, stricken by the Lord with great panic. They will fight their neighbours hand to hand.<br>
14 Judah, too, will be fighting at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the neighbouring nations will be captured -- great quantities of gold and silver and fine clothing.<br>
15 This same plague will strike the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the other animals in the enemy camps.<br>
16 In the end, the enemies of Jerusalem who survive the plague will go up to Jerusalem each year to worship the King, the Lord of Heaven's Armies, and to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.<br>
17 Any nation in the world that refuses to come to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of Heaven's Armies, will have no rain.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
It could be that, this plague, this curse, here in Zechariah 14, is referenced at the very end of the Book of Malachi.<br>
<br>
There are several books in the Old Testament where the chapter numbering in the Hebrew text was slightly different from what we have now in our English Bibles.<br>
That is just something to keep in mind in case you should do a deeper Bible study of the Hebrew text in the Old Testament.<br>
The chapters in The Book of Malachi, in the Hebrew text, were originally numbered as having just three chapters, instead of the four chapters that we have today in our English Bibles.<br>
That would mean, The Book of Malachi that we have today, Chapter 4: verses 1-6 are numbered as, Chapter 3: verses 19-24 in the Hebrew text.<br>
<br>
What we read as His English name, The Lord, in Hebrew, His name would be pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
In the KJV, we see the name of, The Lord of Hosts.<br>
In the NLT, He is called, The Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
In Hebrew, this name would be pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, which, in English, becomes, The Lord of Hosts, or, The Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
<br>
The name, God, in Hebrew, in the TS2009, is called, Elohim, which is pronounced, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
In the Eth Cepher, it is spelled with a letter Y at the end, instead of the letter I, as seen in the TS2009.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mount Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai.<br>

<br>
Book of Malachi, End of Chapter 3 and all of Chapter 4.<br>
Chapter 3, starting at verse 16<br>
and we keep reading to the end of the book of Malachi,<br>
which is at chapter 4, verse 6 -- KJV<br>
<br>
3:16 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.<br>
3:17 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts,<br>
(in that day when I make up my special treasure;)<br>
in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.<br>
3:18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.<br>
4:1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.<br>
4:2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.<br>
4:3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
4:4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgements.<br>
4:5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:<br>
4:6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.<br>

Book of Malachi, End of Chapter 3 and all of Chapter 4.<br>
Chapter 3, starting at verse 16<br>
and we keep reading to the end of the book of Malachi,<br>
which is at chapter 4, verse 6 -- NLT<br>
<br>
16 Then those who feared the Lord spoke with each other, and the Lord listened to what they said. In his presence, a scroll of remembrance was written to record the names of those who feared him and always thought about the honour of his name.<br>
17 "They will be my people," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies. "On the day when I act in judgement, they will be my own special treasure. I will spare them as a father spares an obedient child.<br>
18 Then you will again see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not."<br>
1 The Lord of Heaven's Armies says, "The day of judgement is coming, burning like a furnace. On that day the arrogant and the wicked will be burned up like straw. They will be consumed -- roots, branches, and all.<br>
("But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings.)<br>
2 "But for you who fear my name, the Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in his wings. And you will go free, leaping with joy like calves let out to pasture.<br>
3 On the day when I act, you will tread upon the wicked as if they were dust under your feet," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
4 "Remember to obey the Law of Moses, my servant -- all the decrees and regulations that I gave him on (Mount Horeb,) Mount Sinai for all Israel.<br>
5 "Look, I am sending you the prophet Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord arrives.<br>
6 His preaching will turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers. Otherwise I will come and strike the land with a curse."<br>

Book of Malachi, End of Chapter 3 and all of Chapter 4.<br>
Chapter 3, starting at verse 16<br>
and we keep reading to the end of the book of Malachi,<br>
which is at chapter 4, verse 6 -- TS2009<br>
<br>
16 Then shall those who fear Yaw-Who-Wah speak to one another, and Yaw-Who-Wah listens and hears, and a book of remembrance be written before Him, of those who fear Yaw-Who-Wah, and those who think upon His Name.<br>
17 "And they shall be Mine," said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, "on the day that I prepare a treasured possession. And I shall spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.<br>
18 "Then you shall again see the difference between the righteous and the wrong, between one who serves ELL-Low-Heem and one who does not serve Him.<br>
1 "For look, the day shall come, burning like a furnace, and all the proud, and every wrongdoer shall be stubble. And the day that shall come shall burn them up," said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, "which leaves to them neither root nor branch.<br>
2 "But to you who fear My Name the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings. And you shall go out and leap for joy like calves from the stall.<br>
3 "And you shall trample the wrongdoers, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I do this," said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
4 "Remember the Torah of Moe-Shay, My servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL)  --  laws and right-rulings.<br>
5 "See, I am sending you Eliyah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome day of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
6 "And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with utter destruction."<br>

Isaiah 14:12 -- NLT<br>
"How you are fallen from heaven,<br>
O shining star, son of the morning!<br>
You have been thrown down to the earth,<br>
you who destroyed the nations of the world.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The name of Lucifer is in this verse, but the NLT did not include that name in their translation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 14:12 -- KJV<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The KJV and NLT do a strange thing here in Isaiah 14:12. Right after the spot where it says, son of the morning, there is a Hebrew word there that is ignored and skipped.<br>
They just skip right over it. Why would they do that?  It is right there.<br>
They just skip right over a Hebrew word, that is pronounced, Yah-LeLL.<br>
<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning Yah-LeLL.<br>
If we consult our usual reference books that we have mentioned many times before,<br>
which would be the Strong's Hebrew, and the Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions,<br>
they tell us that this ignored word,<br>
Yah-LeLL, means,<br>
to howl (with a wailing tone) or yell (with a boisterous one) (with a boisterous tone)<br>
to howl, wail, make a howling.<br>
<br>
<br>
If we try to put that in there, it would be like this...<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning Yah-LeLL.<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning, howling.<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, howling.<br>
<br>
The Eth Cepher did not ignore it. This translation has it, but it gets moved over so that it is just before the word, morning, like this...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 14:12 -- Eth Cepher, 3rd Edition, Revision 2.1 (2020)<br>
How you are fallen from heaven, O Heylel (Hey-LayLL), son of the howling morning! how are you cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Lucifer (Hey-LayLL), is the name of the light-bearer, Satan, also known as the king of Babylon.<br>
When satan got thrown out of heaven, falling from heaven, he must have been howling and yelling on his way down!<br>
Why would some translations remove this?<br>
<br>
One is a light-bearer, and one is pure light with no darkness at all.<br>
One has a light, one is light.<br>
One can look like an angel of light, one is light, pure light.<br>
Two stars, one still shining, one fallen: This is the picture of Jesus versus Satan.<br>
Satan was a star, but his light shall be extinguished.<br>
Jesus is the star. Although he was killed, he rose again and resumed his place in the heavens.<br>
One is real. The other one is a fake, counterfeit wannabe.<br>
Jesus is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Satan goes around roaring like a lion or as a lion, but Satan is not a lion. Jesus is.<br>
One is the lion, the other is lyin' about being a lion.<br>
In Matthew 10:16, Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, said, Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.<br>
As he was forced out of heaven, the fallen one was howling as he was falling down, and what sound do wolves make?<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 12: 7-9 -- NLT<br>
7 Then there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels.<br>
8 And the dragon lost the battle, and he and his angels were forced out of heaven.<br>
9 This great dragon -- the ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, the one deceiving the whole world -- was thrown down to the earth with all his angels.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Peter saw Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, and His majestic splendour with his own eyes, remembering that event that is now nicknamed, The Transfiguration. He was there when it happened.<br>
The three accounts of this event are found in<br>
Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9:2-8, and Luke 9:28-36.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1: 18-21 -- NLT<br>
18 We ourselves heard that voice from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.<br>
19 Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by the prophets.<br>
You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place --<br>
until the Day dawns, and Christ the Morning Star shines in your hearts.<br>
(and Christ the Morning Star rises in your hearts.)<br>
20 Above all, you must realise that<br>
(no prophecy in Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,)<br>
no prophecy in Scripture ever came from the prophet's own understanding,<br>
21 or from human initiative. No, those prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit, and they spoke from God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 22:16 -- NLT<br>
"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this message for the churches.<br>
(I am the root and offspring of David.)<br>
I am both the source of David and the heir to his throne.<br>
I am the bright morning star."<br>

Matthew 10:26 (KJV)<br>
Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.<br>
<br>
Matthew 10:26 (NLT)<br>
"But don't be afraid of those who threaten you. For the time is coming when everything that is covered will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 2 & 3 (KJV)<br>
12:2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.<br>
12:3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 2 & 3 (NLT)<br>
2 The time is coming when everything that is covered up will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.<br>
3 Whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be shouted from the housetops for all to hear!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 8:17 (KJV)<br>
For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 8:17 (NLT)<br>
For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4:22 (KJV)<br>
For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4:22 (NLT)<br>
For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.<br>

<br>
Luke 17: 1-10 -- KJV<br>
17:1 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!<br>
17:2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.<br>
17:3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.<br>
17:4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.<br>
17:5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.<br>
17:6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.<br>
17:7 But which of you, having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?<br>
17:8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?<br>
17:9 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trough not.<br>
17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 17: 1-10 -- NLT<br>
1 One day Jesus said to his disciples, "There will always be temptations to sin, but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting!<br>
2 It would be better to be thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to fall into sin.<br>
3 So watch yourselves!<br>
("If your brother sins,)<br>
"If another believer sins, rebuke that person; then if there is repentance, forgive.<br>
4 Even if that person wrongs you seven times a day and each time turns again and asks forgiveness, you must forgive."<br>
5 The apostles said to the Lord, "Show us how to increase our faith."<br>
6 The Lord answered, "If you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'May you be uprooted and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you!<br>
7 "When a servant comes in from ploughing or taking care of sheep, does his master say, 'Come in and eat with me'?<br>
8 No, he says, 'Prepare my meal, put on your apron, and serve me whilst I eat. Then you can eat later.'<br>
9 And does the master thank the servant for doing what he was told to do? Of course not.<br>
10 In the same way, when you obey me you should say, 'We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.'"<br>

2 Corinthians 2: 14-17 -- KJV<br>
2:14 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.<br>
2:15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:<br>
2:16 To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?<br>
(For we are not as many, which deal deceitfully with the word of God:)<br>
2:17 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Since the NLT team decided to use the word, huckster, a quick look in the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford dictionaries, will tell us...<br>
A huckster is a street trader; a hawker or pedlar, an aggressive seller, one who sells aggressively.<br>
A huckster in these modern days is a person who writes advertisements, especially for radio and television, or who sells things or brings ideas or people to the public's attention in a noisy, annoying way.<br>
If you refer to someone as a huckster, you are criticising them for trying to sell useless or worthless things in a dishonest or aggressive way.<br>
A huckster is a person who uses aggressive or annoying methods to sell something.<br>
In the United States, it can also be a person who sells things in the street or by visiting people's houses.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 2: 14-17 -- NLT<br>
14 But thank God! He has made us his captives and continues to lead us along in Christ's triumphal procession. Now he uses us to spread the knowledge of Christ everywhere, like a sweet perfume.<br>
15 Our lives are a Christ-like fragrance rising up to God. But this fragrance is perceived differently by those who are being saved and by those who are perishing.<br>
16 To those who are perishing, we are a dreadful smell of death and doom. But to those who are being saved, we are a life-giving perfume. And who is adequate for such a task as this?<br>
(You see, we are not like the rest of the hucksters who preach for personal profit.)<br>
17 You see, we are not like the many hucksters who preach for personal profit. We preach the word of God with sincerity and with Christ's authority, knowing that God is watching us.<br>

1 Corinthians 2:9 -- KJV<br>
But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 2:9 -- NLT<br>
That is what the Scriptures mean when they say,<br>
"No eye has seen, no ear has heard,<br>
and no mind has imagined<br>
what God has prepared<br>
for those who love him."<br>
<br>
(1 Corinthians 2:9 is quoting from Isaiah 64:4.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 64:4 -- KJV<br>
(For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God beside thee which doeth so for him that waiteth for him.)<br>
For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 64:4 -- NLT<br>
For since the world began,<br>
no ear has heard<br>
and no eye has seen a God like you,<br>
who works for those who wait for him!<br>
<br>
<br>

1 Corinthians 2: 12-16 -- KJV<br>
2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.<br>
2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.<br>
2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.<br>
2:15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.<br>
(But he that is spiritual discerneth all things, yet he himself is discerned of no man.)<br>
(For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he shall instruct him?)<br>
2:16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 2: 12-16 -- NLT<br>
12 And we have received God's Spirit (not the world's spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us.<br>
<br>
13 When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit,<br>
using the Spirit's words to explain spiritual truths.<br>
(explaining spiritual truths in spiritual language.)<br>
(explaining spiritual truths to spiritual people.)<br>
<br>
(But people who don't have the Spirit can't receive these truths from God's Spirit.)<br>
(But people who have only physical life can't receive these truths from God's Spirit.)<br>
14 But people who aren't spiritual can't receive these truths from God's Spirit. It all sounds foolish to them and they can't understand it, for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means.<br>
<br>
15 Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things, but they themselves cannot be evaluated by others.<br>
16<br>
For,<br>
"Who can know the Lord's thoughts?<br>
Who knows enough to teach him?"<br>
But we understand these things, for we have the mind of Christ.<br>

1 Corinthians 11: 23-29 -- KJV<br>
11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:<br>
11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,<br>
Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you:<br>
this do in remembrance of me.<br>
(this do for a remembrance of me.)<br>
11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.<br>
11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup,<br>
(shew ye the Lord's death till he come.)<br>
ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<br>
11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.<br>
11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.<br>
11:29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Verse 27 and verse 29 have the word, unworthily.<br>
Both of these instances of, unworthily, are both being translated from the same Greek word<br>
which is pronounced,<br>
Uh-Knock-See-Ohs<br>
Other ways to say this Greek word, might be like this...<br>
Neck-Soh-s<br>
Ah-Leck-See-Ohs<br>
<br>
It's the same Greek word in both Verse 27 and verse 29, that becomes the English word, unworthily.<br>
it means,<br>
unworthily, in an unworthy manner<br>
irreverently<br>
<br>
A quick look in the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford dictionaries, will tell us...<br>
irreverent means,<br>
lacking respect or reverence<br>
not showing the expected respect for official, important, or holy things<br>
If you describe someone as irreverent, you mean that they do not show respect for people or things that are generally respected.<br>
without due respect or veneration; disrespectful; flippant, cheeky<br>
not showing respect to somebody/something that other people usually respect<br>
<br>
<br>
unworthily means,<br>
not deserving respect, attention<br>
unworthy, without worth; of little or no merit or value.<br>
in a way that deserves no respect, admiration, or support<br>
not deserving or worthy<br>
beneath the level considered befitting (to)<br>
lacking merit or value<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
An example of this would be me handing you a piece of paper.<br>
I hand it to you, and a couple of days later, I ask you, what did you do with that piece of paper?<br>
And then you say, oh, I'm not sure, maybe I binned it, I threw it away, or maybe I used it for a bookmark in one of those books stacked over there.<br>
Then I say, did you notice that the piece of paper was a fifty pound (£50) banknote? Or, in the United States, I might say, oh, didn't you notice that the piece of paper was a fifty dollar ($50) bill?<br>
It was paper cash money. It was a physical piece of paper, but it had value and worth.<br>
Treating banknotes and paper cash money as ordinary pieces of paper is treating them unworthily, not giving them the worth, value, attention and respect that they deserve.<br>
<br>
Treating communion, the breaking of bread as, just a quick bite of bread or cracker, and quick sip of juice or wine, and thinking nothing more of it than that, is treating it unworthily, not giving it the worth, value, attention and respect that it deserves.<br>
It reminds us that He has entered into us, saves us, heals us, remodels us and dwells within us, filling us with His spirit so that we have the strength and power to follow him, obey him, and keep His commandments.<br>
Like the bread entering into you and becoming a part of you, that bread reminds you that He has entered into you and has now become a part of you.<br>
The bread, His body, is now a part of your body, making you part of the body of Christ; one big body of believers all around the world.<br>
Be thankful and remember that, doing that in remembrance of Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11: 23-29 -- NLT<br>
23 For I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread<br>
24 and gave thanks to God for it.<br>
Then he broke it in pieces and said, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."<br>
("This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.")<br>
("This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me.")<br>
<br>
25 In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant between God and his people -- an agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it."<br>
26 For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes again.<br>
<br>
(So anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is responsible for sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.)<br>
27 So anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.<br>
28 That is why you should examine yourself before eating the bread and drinking the cup.<br>
29 For if you eat the bread or drink the cup without honouring (the body, the Lord's body, the Master's body) the body of Christ, you are eating and drinking God's judgement upon yourself.<br>

Commentary:<br>
In Christian Essays 9, the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 9,<br>
In the Bible study, called, Passover, we saw this next verse mentioned during that Bible study.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Right after Jesus Feeds Five Thousand, people kept following Him around, everywhere.<br>
He finally turns around, and basically tells them that He knows why they are following Him around.<br>
It is not to learn something, it is not to hear more of His teachings, it is not to listen and to follow and to obey Him.<br>
They just want the free food. Jesus knew what was going on in their inner thoughts and minds.<br>
There were those that were there, not because of the teachings of Jesus, not because of the healings and miracles that happened right before their eyes.<br>
They were only there for the free food after the church service.<br>
<br>
Here is the NLT of John 6:26:<br>
Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, you want to be with me because I fed you, not because you understood the miraculous signs.<br>
<br>
Paul saw the same thing.<br>
Very hungry people show up for the church gathering.<br>
Paul would do a prayer with Communion, also known as the Lord's Supper, or the breaking of bread.<br>
He would always do a short prayer with the breaking of bread, before eating the food on the table.<br>
Today, that may be people waiting to pray before starting to eat the meal placed before them on the table.<br>
The tradition of pausing to pray before eating could be traced back to the first act of communion done during His last supper.<br>
<br>
I imagine that people would show up to the church gathering just for the free food, and would not wait, and would not think about the worth and value of what the breaking of bread really means.<br>
Come on, let's get this over with. Eat a piece of bread, or a piece of a cracker, take a sip of wine or grape juice or what have you.<br>
Done. Let's eat, and they race to the front of the queue, and pile on the food on the plate.<br>
As for the old and poor people at the end of the queue, at the end of the line, by the time they get to the food, there's almost nothing left for them.<br>
<br>
People were ignoring the value and worth of the breaking of bread, praying before eating, Communion, the Lord's Supper, because they just wanted to eat lots of food and get drunk with lots of wine.<br>
Paul tells them, if you're really that hungry, you should eat at home first before coming to the gathering, so you don't disgrace God's church and shame the poor.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11: 20-22 -- NLT<br>
20 When you meet together, you are not really interested in the Lord's Supper.<br>
21 For some of you hurry to eat your own meal without sharing with others. As a result, some go hungry whilst others get drunk.<br>
22 What? Don't you have your own homes for eating and drinking? Or do you really want to disgrace God's church and shame the poor? What am I supposed to say? Do you want me to praise you? Well, I certainly will not praise you for this!<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11: 33 & 34 -- NLT<br>
...when you gather for the Lord's Supper, wait for each other.<br>
34 If you are really hungry, eat at home so you won't bring judgement upon yourselves when you meet together.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, this concept that anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is guilty of sinning,<br>
It may be that one should slow down and remember what it means.<br>
<br>
Reminders are of no worth or value if you don't respect, appreciate and remember what the reminders mean.<br>
We have New Covenant reminders that go inside, and we have Old Covenant reminders that are on the outside.<br>
The new covenant reminder is communion, and the old covenant reminder are the blue reminder strings.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Christian Essays 10, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 10,<br>
We did a Bible study, called, Reminders.<br>
We saw a Feminine Hebrew word for a fringe or tassel, which is pronounced,<br>
Seat-Sith, or, Seats, or, Sit-Seen<br>
Today, people may call them, Tzit-Tzit, which is commonly pronounced, Zeet-Zeets.<br>
They are four blue reminder strings on the outside, and we have the bread, blood and water symbolic reminders entering into the inside.<br>
Think about these two reminders working together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Outside first, did not work because the inside needed fixing.<br>
So, Yaw-Who-Shaw goes inside, fixes the inside,<br>
Now the outside can work correctly.<br>
<br>
A car does not go down the road on the outside, so we go inside, under the bonnet, under the hood, to repair it.<br>
Now the car can go down the road fast on the outside, because the inside was fixed.<br>
<br>
You could not do the outside actions of the commandments because your mind was dirty and needed cleaning, and your heart was broken.<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw goes inside, communion, the body, the living water, the life blood going in, so He can clean, and repair and heal and forgive and save.<br>
Now we can go back to the outside and go in the right direction, and perform the right actions, doing the Old Covenant successfully,<br>
doing what the blue string reminders represent. We can perform right on the outside because the inside is fixed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36: 25-27 Commentary:<br>
Verse 25: Trying to stay clean on the outside, (Tzit-Tzit) but the dirty mind and broken heart needs replacement and a change of mind.<br>
Verse 26: He (communion) goes inside, and does a heart replacement.<br>
Verse 27: His spirit now lives and dwells inside of you (communion) on the inside and that causes you to obey him successfully on the outside (Tzit-Tzit).<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36: 25-27 -- NLT<br>
25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship idols.<br>
26 And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart (a heart of flesh.)<br>
27 And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.<br>
<br>
It says, I will, I will and I will. It's not that you will, it says, I will.  He does it, not you.<br>
He cleans the outside, fixes the inside, and causes you to obey and follow him on the outside.<br>
He does it, not you.<br>
<br>
If the car does not work, go inside, fix the car's insides, and now the car can go down the road and get stuff done.<br>
<br>
Old covenant, failed. New Covenant fix, now the Old covenant can be carried out successfully.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now let's talk about how often. Do this often.<br>
<br>
Every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, as often as you eat or drink.<br>
Is that how often they did communion, the breaking of bread?<br>
Did they only do it on Passover? How often should we do this often and in remembrance of Him, not you, not me, but Him, and what He finished on the cross for us?<br>
<br>
<br>
Paul really did appear to do it often. Every time he gathered together, on any days when they gathered together,<br>
on sabbath days and non-sabbath days.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 20: 6 & 7 -- KJV<br>
20:6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.<br>
20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.<br>
<br>
KJV got that right, but the NLT made a mistake in verse 6, when one looks at the original Greek in verse 6.<br>
Let's fix verse 6 in the NLT, and if we do, this is how it should have been said.<br>
<br>
Acts 20: 6 & 7 -- NLT -- If we look at the Greek wording, and put it in verse 6, it should read like this...<br>
6 After the days of unleavened bread ended, we boarded a ship at Philippi in Macedonia and five days later joined them in Troas, where we stayed a week.<br>
7 On the first day of the week, we gathered with the local believers to break bread. Paul was preaching to them, and since he was leaving the next day, he kept talking until midnight.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the NLT mentions the original Greek of verse 6 in a footnote or margin note.<br>
I'm glad they did that. That's why you always need to read the footnotes and margin notes in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The days of unleavened bread, and Passover, are two different things, but they both start at the same time, at sunset, on the same appointed day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Passover is a meal.<br>
The days of unleavened bread are seven days. It is obvious that the NLT team were confused about this, and have made mistakes, saying that Passover is seven days.<br>
When people do not seriously study this in the Bible, they will show their lack of understanding.<br>
The NLT does get confused in some areas in the New Testament.<br>
A preparation day is the day before a day of rest, a Sabbath, which, in Hebrew, is pronounced, Shuh-Bought.<br>
Every Friday is a preparation day, because every Saturday is a Sabbath day of rest, if you are obeying the Bible.<br>
On every Sabbath day of rest, you do not work, you do not make someone work for you for money, and you do not work for someone else for money, and you do not buy or sell, and have money transactions, you do not do these things on every Sabbath day of rest, if you are obeying the Bible.<br>
<br>
The feast of unleavened bread, Day 1 of 7 is a Sabbath, so the day before is a preparation day.<br>
The day begins at sunset on the evening before. At that moment of sunset, Passover is eaten with unleavened bread.<br>
The hours before that sunset would be a preparation day. The Passover lamb would be cooking during that time before sunset.<br>
<br>
The terms, preparation day, Passover, and days of unleavened bread, were confusing to the NLT team, and they have gotten these differences mixed-up, and it shows when comparing the NLT with the KJV.<br>
Keep that in mind when reading the NLT New Testament. If you study the seven feasts carefully, you will detect these mistakes in the NLT.<br>
When you see in the NLT, the words, preparation day, Passover, and days of unleavened bread, remember that they might not be identifying these days accurately in the NLT New Testament.<br>
<br>
Here is what the NLT did, which is wrong, when compared to to words found in the original Greek...<br>
<br>
Acts 20: 6 & 7 -- NLT<br>
6 After the Passover ended, we boarded a ship at Philippi in Macedonia and five days later joined them in Troas, where we stayed a week.<br>
7 On the first day of the week, we gathered with the local believers to share in the Lord's Supper. Paul was preaching to them, and since he was leaving the next day, he kept talking until midnight.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Again, there in verse 6, the original Greek, where the NLT placed the word, Passover, the Greek right there means, "After the days of unleavened bread ended."  Days of unleavened bread, and Passover are two different things. Passover is a meal. So, the question is, did Paul do the breaking of bread communion just before every meal? This example, here in Acts 20: 6 & 7, indicates that he really did it that often.<br>
<br>
Let's think carefully about the information provided right here. First, he did this breaking of bread and praying just before eating a meal. They most likely did it with the Passover meal. The Passover meal would have been at the very start of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.<br>
According to Acts 20: 6 & 7, in the Greek, here is what we see. The feast of Unleavened Bread, we know is seven days long. So, seven days have now come and gone. Next, he gets on a ship. Five more days have now gone by. There is no special feast at this time.<br>
Feasts 1, 2 and 3 of 7 have all passed by, and there is no special feast at this time.<br>
Next, he indicates that he gathered with believers on a Sunday. According to the Bible, a Sunday is an ordinary day of the week. Saturday is a holy, set-apart day of rest, but not Sunday. The idea of Sunday being a day of rest is a satanic lie invented by Catholics, and is not in the Bible at all. So, not a special feast day, not a sabbath day of rest, just an ordinary day where he gathered with the local believers to break bread, and then spends the day teaching and preaching to them. So, this example shows us that, when Paul gathers with believers, he would break bread, which is communion, and he did this even if the day was not a sabbath day, and he did this on any ordinary day, even if there was no special feast day going on at that time. That is how often they did this.  They did not do this only on Passover, they did not do this only on a Sabbath church gathering, they did it even more often than that.<br>
<br>
Again, the idea or tradition of saying a prayer just before eating a meal today, could be traced back to when Paul would do a breaking of bread, and then saying a prayer of thanks just before eating a meal. That still sounds like a great idea, and the Bible totally supports it.<br>
<br>
As we finish up this Bible study, we have another example here of when Paul does this when he was gathered with others. He indicates that he did a breaking of bread, and he did a prayer of thanks with the soldiers and sailors on a ship that was about to be shipwrecked.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 27: 30-38 -- KJV<br>
27:30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,<br>
27:31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.<br>
27:32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.<br>
27:33 And whilst the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.<br>
27:34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.<br>
27:35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.<br>
27:36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.<br>
27:37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.<br>
27:38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 27: 30-38 -- NLT<br>
30 Then the sailors tried to abandon the ship; they lowered the lifeboat as though they were going to put out anchors from the front of the ship.<br>
31 But Paul said to the commanding officer and the soldiers, "You will all die unless the sailors stay aboard."<br>
32 So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and let it drift away.<br>
33 Just as day was dawning, Paul urged everyone to eat. "You have been so worried that you haven't touched food for two weeks," he said.<br>
34 "Please eat something now for your own good. For not a hair of your heads will perish."<br>
35 Then he took some bread, gave thanks to God before them all, and broke off a piece and ate it.<br>
36 Then everyone was encouraged and began to eat --<br>
37 all 276 of us who were on board.<br>
38 After eating, the crew lightened the ship further by throwing the cargo of wheat overboard.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
So, in conclusion, Paul did the breaking of bread and a prayer of thanks just before eating a meal.<br>
<br>
He did it with every meal. He did anyway, even if it was not a Saturday church or fellowship gathering.<br>
Even if it was not on a Shabbat, a Sabbath day of rest, he still did it anyway.<br>
Even if it was not a special feast day, he still did it anyway.<br>
Even if it was not the Passover meal, he still did it anyway.<br>
He did it on any day, at least every time he was gathered with others, eating a meal with others.<br>
<br>
Let's learn from his example. We don't have to wait until a gathering with others.<br>
We don't have to wait until a certain day of the week. We don't have to wait until a certain feast day.<br>
We, too, can take a moment and use the breaking of bread as a reminder that He has entered into us, and dwells inside of us, and we too can give a prayer of thanks.<br>

13:8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.<br>
13:9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.<br>
13:10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 13: 4-10 -- NLT<br>
4 So he got up from the table, took off his robe, wrapped a towel around his waist,<br>
5 and poured water into a basin. Then he began to wash the disciples' feet, drying them with the towel he had around him.<br>
6 When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"<br>
7 Jesus replied, "You don't understand now what I am doing, but someday you will."<br>
8 "No," Peter protested, "you will never ever wash my feet!"<br>
Jesus replied, "Unless I wash you, you won't belong to me."<br>
9 Simon Peter exclaimed, "Then wash my hands and head as well, Lord, not just my feet!"<br>
10 Jesus replied, "A person who has bathed all over does not need to wash, except for the feet, to be entirely clean. And you disciples are clean....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 13: 12-15 -- KJV<br>
13:12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?<br>
13:13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.<br>
13:14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.<br>
13:15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 13: 12-15 -- NLT<br>
12 After washing their feet, he put on his robe again and sat down and asked, "Do you understand what I was doing?<br>
13 You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and you are right, because that's what I am.<br>
14 And since I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash each other's feet.<br>
15 I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you.<br>

<br>
Let's now spend another random moment thinking about some things in the book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of Enoch talks about fallen watchers.<br>
Do we have any mention of these fallen watchers in the Bible?<br>
Yes, we do.<br>
In the Old Testament, in Daniel 4, where the NLT says, messenger, in the Aramaic language, it means, watcher.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 4: Verse 13, Verse 23, and then verses 28 through 30, and then verse 33 -- NLT<br>
13 "'Then as I lay there dreaming, I saw a messenger, (a watcher,) a holy one, coming down from heaven.<br>
23 "'Then you saw a messenger, (a watcher,) a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, "Cut down the tree and destroy it. But leave the stump and the roots in the ground, bound with a band of iron and bronze and surrounded by tender grass. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven. Let him live with the animals of the field for seven periods of time."<br>
28 "But all these things did happen to King Nebuchadnezzar.<br>
29 Twelve months later he was taking a walk on the flat roof of the royal palace in Babylon.<br>
30 As he looked out across the city, he said, 'Look at this great city of Babylon! By my own mighty power, I have built this beautiful city as my royal residence to display my majestic splendour.'<br>
<br>
33 "That same hour the judgement was fulfilled, and Nebuchadnezzar was driven from human society. He ate grass like a cow, and he was drenched with the dew of heaven. He lived this way until his hair was as long as eagles' feathers and his nails were like birds' claws.<br>
<br>
<br>
We are targeting Daniel 4, verse 13 and verse 23.<br>
In the KJV...<br>
4:13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;<br>
4:23 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven....<br>
<br>
We will look at that some more, here, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the New Testament, there are two places in the KJV, where we see something that could be these fallen watchers.<br>
In the KJV, they call them, dignities, and in the NLT, they call them, Supernatural Beings.<br>
They did strange and unnatural sexual and genetic modifications, doing strange merging and mixing of genetics, unnatural merging and mixing of different species, creating hybrids of different species.<br>
It was breaking the law, a violation of Torah, to make these creatures.<br>
Here is a list of some of their strange, unnatural hybrid creations...<br>
Centaur - Half man, half horse.<br>
Minotaur - Half man, half bull.<br>
Cyclops - Giant with a single eye in the middle of the forehead.<br>
Satyr (or Faun) - Half man, half goat.<br>
Sphinx - Body of a lion, wings of an eagle, and the face of a woman.<br>
Chimera - A creature with the body and head of a lion, a goat's head emerging from its back, and a tail that ends in a serpent's head.<br>
Hippocampus - Half horse, half fish.<br>
Harpies - Birds with the faces of women.<br>
Griffin - Body of a lion, head, and wings of an eagle.<br>
Gorgon - Woman with snakes for hair, whose gaze turns people to stone (one famous Gorgon was known by the name of Medusa).<br>
Lamia - Woman with the lower body of a serpent.<br>
Echidna - Half woman, half snake.<br>
Manticore - Body of a lion, tail of a scorpion, and a human face.<br>
Typhon - Giant with a hundred dragon heads.<br>
Pegasus - Winged horse.<br>
Cerberus - Three-headed dog.<br>
Hecatoncheires (Hundred-Handers) - Giants with a hundred hands and fifty heads.<br>
Ophiotaurus - Creature that is part bull, part serpent.<br>
Ichthyocentaur - Upper body of a human, lower front of a horse, and tail of a fish.<br>
Sirens - Half bird, half woman, known for their enchanting voices.<br>
Mermaid - The upper body of a human female and the lower body of a fish.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 2:10 -- KJV<br>
2:10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government (and despise dominion). Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 2:10 -- NLT<br>
These people are proud and arrogant, daring even to scoff at supernatural beings without so much as trembling.<br>
(daring even to scoff at glorious ones, evil angels, without so much as trembling.)<br>
<br>
Jude 1: 6-8 -- KJV<br>
(And the angels which kept not their principality, but left their own habitation,)<br>
1:6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgement of the great day.<br>
1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, (and going after other flesh,) and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.<br>
1:8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.<br>
<br>
Jude 1: 6-8 -- NLT<br>
6 And I remind you of the angels who did not stay within the limits of authority God gave them but left the place where they belonged. God has kept them securely chained in prisons of darkness, waiting for the great day of judgement.<br>
7 And don't forget Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring towns, which were filled with immorality and every kind of sexual perversion. Those cities were destroyed by fire and serve as a warning of the eternal fire of God's judgement.<br>
8 In the same way, these people -- who claim authority from their dreams -- live immoral lives, defy authority, and scoff at supernatural beings.<br>
(and scoff at glorious ones, evil angels.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's go to our usual reference books and find out what is going on in these areas.<br>
<br>
Daniel 4: Verse 13, and Verse 23 -- KJV<br>
4:13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;<br>
4:23 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven....<br>
<br>
Daniel 4: Verse 13, and Verse 23 -- KJV<br>
4:13 ...a watcher<br>
4:23 ...a watcher<br>
<br>
Both of these verses, where it says, watcher, the same Hebrew word is found in both of these locations.<br>
<br>
Again, in both verse 13 and 23, where we see the word, watcher, it is the same Hebrew word in both of those verses.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word is pronounced, EE-Uhr<br>
It sounds very similar to the English word, Ear.<br>
<br>
We will look at this word, and the root words that it comes from.<br>
<br>
It means,<br>
a watcher, that is, an angel (as guardian)<br>
waking, watchful, wakeful one, watcher, angel<br>
through the idea of opening the eyes; to wake (literally or figuratively)<br>
to rouse oneself, awake, awaken, incite<br>
through the idea of opening the eyes<br>
to stir up, rouse, incite<br>
to be excited, be triumphant<br>
to act in an aroused manner, awake<br>
<br>
to be exposed<br>
be bared, be laid bare<br>
<br>
That was in Daniel 4.<br>
Let's look at that word that we saw in 2 Peter 2:10 and in Jude 1:8.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 2:10 -- KJV<br>
we saw, in the KJV, the English word, dignities.<br>
<br>
Jude 1:8 -- KJV<br>
same English word there as well, dignities.<br>
<br>
In both of these places, where they both use the same word, dignities,<br>
It is the exact same Greek word in both of these verses.<br>
In both of these verses, we have the same Greek word there.<br>
In the ancient Greek language, back when the New Testament was written, it was pronounced<br>
Docks-Uh.<br>
In the Greek language today, it may be pronounced,<br>
Icks-Suh<br>
or, possibly, it could be pronounced,<br>
Nicks-Suh<br>
<br>
We will look at this word, and the root words that it comes from.<br>
<br>
It is a word that means,<br>
honour, renown; glory, an especially divine quality, the unspoken manifestation of God, splendour.<br>
visible brightness, splendour, glory: of light<br>
glory (as very apparent)<br>
of the moon, sun, stars<br>
<br>
Commentary: When the angels all come down to escort the believers up into the clouds, all of the stars fall from the sky just before that.<br>
Could those stars, those luminaries, be angels?<br>
It seems logical that they are.<br>
They come down from the heavens to come down here and escort us believers up to where we meet the Messiah up in the clouds.<br>
All of the stars falling down from the sky would be them coming down to here to get us.<br>
<br>
Job 38:7 (KJV)<br>
"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:20 (KJV)<br>
"The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches."<br>
<br>
Enoch 18:15-16 (R.H. Charles' English translation, 1912)<br>
"And I saw the prison of the angels who were held there in punishment. And I watched the stars of heaven come forth."<br>
<br>
Enoch 21:3-6 (R.H. Charles' English translation, 1912)<br>
"And I proceeded to where things were chaotic. And I saw there something horrible: I saw neither a heaven above nor a firmly founded earth, but a place chaotic and horrible. And there I saw seven stars of the heaven bound together in it, like great mountains and burning with fire. Then I said, 'For what sin are they bound, and on what account have they been cast in hither?' Then said Uriel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, and was chief over them, and said: 'Enoch, why dost thou ask, and why art thou eager for the truth? These are of the number of the stars of heaven, which have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and are bound here till ten thousand years, the time entailed by their sins, are consummated.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
One way how we know that the R.H. Charles translation has good precision and accuracy,<br>
is that it compares well with the fragments of Enoch found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls were not yet discovered when R.H. Charles published his Enoch translation in 1912.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered between 1947 and 1956 in a series of caves near the site of Qumran in the West Bank. The first discovery was made by a Bedouin shepherd in early 1947, who stumbled upon the initial cave containing several scrolls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Only fragments of the Book of 1 Enoch were found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls, not the entire book.<br>
These fragments were primarily written in Aramaic and consist of various portions of the text,<br>
indicating that the book was known and used by the community at Qumran.<br>
<br>
Comparative studies generally find that whilst there are some differences between those Aramaic fragments found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Ethiopic text used by R.H. Charles for his translation, the core content and themes are consistent.<br>
<br>
The English translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls by Michael Wise, Martin Abegg, and Edward Cook was published in 1996. The book is titled "The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation," and it includes English translations of many of the scrolls, including fragments of the Book of 1 Enoch.<br>
<br>
Here is one example where they were different.<br>
<br>
Enoch 6:1-2 -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912)
"And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from amongst the children of men and beget us children.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 6:1-2 -- Dead Sea Scrolls English Translation (From Michael Wise, Martin Abegg, and Edward Cook) (1996)<br>
"And it came to pass, when the sons of men had increased, that in those days there were born to them fair and beautiful daughters. And the Watchers, the sons of heaven, saw them and desired them. And they said to one another, 'Come, let us choose for ourselves wives from the daughters of men, and let us beget children for ourselves.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The R.H. Charles translation uses "angels, the children of the heaven," whilst the Dead Sea Scrolls translation uses "Watchers, the sons of heaven." The term "Watchers" is more specific and aligns with the Aramaic term used in the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>
The sons of heaven is more accurate, because we know that they had no women in heaven, because they were eternal, and lived forever, so there was no need to have sexual reproduction, because they did not get old and die in heaven.<br>
That's why the fallen watchers desired to do sexual reproduction experiments, because they did not have sexual reproduction in heaven.<br>
<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls translation tends to have a slightly more modern and less archaic language style compared to R.H. Charles' early 20th-century English.<br>
<br>
Small differences in phrasing exist, such as "beget us children" (Charles) versus "let us beget children for ourselves" (Dead Sea Scrolls). These variations do not significantly alter the meaning but reflect slight differences in translation choices.<br>
<br>
These differences highlight the nuances in translation and terminology but generally maintain the same overall narrative. The variations provide insights into how different translators handle ancient texts and the textual traditions from which they work.<br>
<br>
Here is another example comparing a passage from the R.H. Charles translation of the Book of Enoch with the English translation made from the Dead Sea Scrolls fragments.<br>
<br>
Enoch 8:1-2 -- R.H. Charles Translation (1912)<br>
"And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways."<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 8:1-2 -- Dead Sea Scrolls English Translation (1996)<br>
"And Azazel taught men to make swords and knives and shields and breastplates, and made known to them the metals and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of rouge, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of precious stones, and all colouring tinctures. And there was great impiety; they turned away from God and committed fornication; they were led astray and became corrupt in all their ways."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The term "antimony" in the R.H. Charles translation is translated as "rouge" in the Dead Sea Scrolls translation. Both terms refer to cosmetics, but "rouge" is a more specific modern term for a type of cosmetic.<br>
<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls translation uses "impiety" instead of "godlessness," which is a slight variation in word choice but conveys a similar meaning.<br>
<br>
The phrase "there arose much godlessness" (Charles)<br>
is rendered as<br>
"there was great impiety" in the Dead Sea Scrolls translation.<br>
Similarly, "they committed fornication, and they were led astray" (Charles)<br>
is rendered as<br>
"they turned away from God and committed fornication; they were led astray" in the Dead Sea Scrolls translation,<br>
adding a specific mention of turning away from God.<br>
<br>
These differences illustrate the subtle variations in translation choices and phrasing that can occur even when the overall meaning remains consistent. The more modern translation often aims for clarity and accessibility whilst maintaining fidelity to the original text.<br>
<br>
As of June of 2024, the book "The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation" by Michael Wise, Martin Abegg, and Edward Cook, published in 1996, can be accessed for free online at the Internet Archive. You can read the book and compare translations of the Dead Sea Scrolls there.<br>
They say it is free, but you have to sign-up, register, log in and borrow the book, that is, be given temporary permission to access and read the book online for free, at the Internet Archive website.<br>
<br>
And, that concludes our random little moment, thinking once again about things found in the book of Enoch.<br>
