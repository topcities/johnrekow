Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

Zechariah 14: 13-17 -- NLT<br>
12 And the Lord will send a plague on all the nations that fought against Jerusalem. Their people will become like walking corpses, their flesh rotting away. Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.<br>
13 On that day they will be terrified, stricken by the Lord with great panic. They will fight their neighbours hand to hand.<br>
14 Judah, too, will be fighting at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the neighbouring nations will be captured -- great quantities of gold and silver and fine clothing.<br>
15 This same plague will strike the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the other animals in the enemy camps.<br>
16 In the end, the enemies of Jerusalem who survive the plague will go up to Jerusalem each year to worship the King, the Lord of Heaven's Armies, and to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.<br>
17 Any nation in the world that refuses to come to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of Heaven's Armies, will have no rain.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
It could be that, this plague, this curse, here in Zechariah 14, is referenced at the very end of the Book of Malachi.<br>
<br>
There are several books in the Old Testament where the chapter numbering in the Hebrew text was slightly different from what we have now in our English Bibles.<br>
That is just something to keep in mind in case you should do a deeper Bible study of the Hebrew text in the Old Testament.<br>
The chapters in The Book of Malachi, in the Hebrew text, were originally numbered as having just three chapters, instead of the four chapters that we have today in our English Bibles.<br>
That would mean, The Book of Malachi that we have today, Chapter 4: verses 1-6 are numbered as, Chapter 3: verses 19-24 in the Hebrew text.<br>
<br>
What we read as His English name, The Lord, in Hebrew, His name would be pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
In the KJV, we see the name of, The Lord of Hosts.<br>
In the NLT, He is called, The Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
In Hebrew, this name would be pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, which, in English, becomes, The Lord of Hosts, or, The Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
<br>
The name, God, in Hebrew, in the TS2009, is called, Elohim, which is pronounced, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
In the Eth Cepher, it is spelled with a letter Y at the end, instead of the letter I, as seen in the TS2009.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mount Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai.<br>

<br>
Book of Malachi, End of Chapter 3 and all of Chapter 4.<br>
Chapter 3, starting at verse 16<br>
and we keep reading to the end of the book of Malachi,<br>
which is at chapter 4, verse 6 -- KJV<br>
<br>
3:16 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.<br>
3:17 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts,<br>
(in that day when I make up my special treasure;)<br>
in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.<br>
3:18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.<br>
4:1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.<br>
4:2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.<br>
4:3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
4:4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgements.<br>
4:5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:<br>
4:6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.<br>

Book of Malachi, End of Chapter 3 and all of Chapter 4.<br>
Chapter 3, starting at verse 16<br>
and we keep reading to the end of the book of Malachi,<br>
which is at chapter 4, verse 6 -- NLT<br>
<br>
16 Then those who feared the Lord spoke with each other, and the Lord listened to what they said. In his presence, a scroll of remembrance was written to record the names of those who feared him and always thought about the honour of his name.<br>
17 "They will be my people," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies. "On the day when I act in judgement, they will be my own special treasure. I will spare them as a father spares an obedient child.<br>
18 Then you will again see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not."<br>
1 The Lord of Heaven's Armies says, "The day of judgement is coming, burning like a furnace. On that day the arrogant and the wicked will be burned up like straw. They will be consumed -- roots, branches, and all.<br>
("But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings.)<br>
2 "But for you who fear my name, the Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in his wings. And you will go free, leaping with joy like calves let out to pasture.<br>
3 On the day when I act, you will tread upon the wicked as if they were dust under your feet," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
4 "Remember to obey the Law of Moses, my servant -- all the decrees and regulations that I gave him on (Mount Horeb,) Mount Sinai for all Israel.<br>
5 "Look, I am sending you the prophet Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord arrives.<br>
6 His preaching will turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers. Otherwise I will come and strike the land with a curse."<br>

Book of Malachi, End of Chapter 3 and all of Chapter 4.<br>
Chapter 3, starting at verse 16<br>
and we keep reading to the end of the book of Malachi,<br>
which is at chapter 4, verse 6 -- TS2009<br>
<br>
16 Then shall those who fear Yaw-Who-Wah speak to one another, and Yaw-Who-Wah listens and hears, and a book of remembrance be written before Him, of those who fear Yaw-Who-Wah, and those who think upon His Name.<br>
17 "And they shall be Mine," said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, "on the day that I prepare a treasured possession. And I shall spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.<br>
18 "Then you shall again see the difference between the righteous and the wrong, between one who serves ELL-Low-Heem and one who does not serve Him.<br>
1 "For look, the day shall come, burning like a furnace, and all the proud, and every wrongdoer shall be stubble. And the day that shall come shall burn them up," said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, "which leaves to them neither root nor branch.<br>
2 "But to you who fear My Name the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings. And you shall go out and leap for joy like calves from the stall.<br>
3 "And you shall trample the wrongdoers, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I do this," said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
4 "Remember the Torah of Moe-Shay, My servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL)  --  laws and right-rulings.<br>
5 "See, I am sending you Eliyah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome day of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
6 "And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with utter destruction."<br>

Isaiah 14:12 -- NLT<br>
"How you are fallen from heaven,<br>
O shining star, son of the morning!<br>
You have been thrown down to the earth,<br>
you who destroyed the nations of the world.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The name of Lucifer is in this verse, but the NLT did not include that name in their translation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 14:12 -- KJV<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The KJV and NLT do a strange thing here in Isaiah 14:12. Right after the spot where it says, son of the morning, there is a Hebrew word there that is ignored and skipped.<br>
They just skip right over it. Why would they do that?  It is right there.<br>
They just skip right over a Hebrew word, that is pronounced, Yah-LeLL.<br>
<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning Yah-LeLL.<br>
If we consult our usual reference books that we have mentioned many times before,<br>
which would be the Strong's Hebrew, and the Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions,<br>
they tell us that this ignored word,<br>
Yah-LeLL, means,<br>
to howl (with a wailing tone) or yell (with a boisterous one) (with a boisterous tone)<br>
to howl, wail, make a howling.<br>
<br>
<br>
If we try to put that in there, it would be like this...<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning Yah-LeLL.<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, (O day star) O Lucifer, son of the morning, howling.<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, howling.<br>
<br>
The Eth Cepher did not ignore it. This translation has it, but it gets moved over so that it is just before the word, morning, like this...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 14:12 -- Eth Cepher, 3rd Edition, Revision 2.1 (2020)<br>
How you are fallen from heaven, O Heylel (Hey-LayLL), son of the howling morning! how are you cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Lucifer (Hey-LayLL), is the name of the light-bearer, Satan, also known as the king of Babylon.<br>
When satan got thrown out of heaven, falling from heaven, he must have been howling and yelling on his way down!<br>
Why would some translations remove this?<br>
<br>
One is a light-bearer, and one is pure light with no darkness at all.<br>
One has a light, one is light.<br>
One can look like an angel of light, one is light, pure light.<br>
Two stars, one still shining, one fallen: This is the picture of Jesus versus Satan.<br>
Satan was a star, but his light shall be extinguished.<br>
Jesus is the star. Although he was killed, he rose again and resumed his place in the heavens.<br>
One is real. The other one is a fake, counterfeit wannabe.<br>
Jesus is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Satan goes around roaring like a lion or as a lion, but Satan is not a lion. Jesus is.<br>
One is the lion, the other is lyin' about being a lion.<br>
In Matthew 10:16, Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, said, Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.<br>
As he was forced out of heaven, the fallen one was howling as he was falling down, and what sound do wolves make?<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 12: 7-9 -- NLT<br>
7 Then there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels.<br>
8 And the dragon lost the battle, and he and his angels were forced out of heaven.<br>
9 This great dragon -- the ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, the one deceiving the whole world -- was thrown down to the earth with all his angels.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Peter saw Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, and His majestic splendour with his own eyes, remembering that event that is now nicknamed, The Transfiguration. He was there when it happened.<br>
The three accounts of this event are found in<br>
Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9:2-8, and Luke 9:28-36.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1: 18-21 -- NLT<br>
18 We ourselves heard that voice from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.<br>
19 Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by the prophets.<br>
You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place --<br>
until the Day dawns, and Christ the Morning Star shines in your hearts.<br>
(and Christ the Morning Star rises in your hearts.)<br>
20 Above all, you must realise that<br>
(no prophecy in Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,)<br>
no prophecy in Scripture ever came from the prophet's own understanding,<br>
21 or from human initiative. No, those prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit, and they spoke from God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 22:16 -- NLT<br>
"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this message for the churches.<br>
(I am the root and offspring of David.)<br>
I am both the source of David and the heir to his throne.<br>
I am the bright morning star."<br>

Matthew 10:26 (KJV)<br>
Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.<br>
<br>
Matthew 10:26 (NLT)<br>
"But don't be afraid of those who threaten you. For the time is coming when everything that is covered will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 2 & 3 (KJV)<br>
12:2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.<br>
12:3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 2 & 3 (NLT)<br>
2 The time is coming when everything that is covered up will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.<br>
3 Whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be shouted from the housetops for all to hear!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 8:17 (KJV)<br>
For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 8:17 (NLT)<br>
For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4:22 (KJV)<br>
For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4:22 (NLT)<br>
For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 17: 1-10 -- KJV<br>
17:1 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!<br>
17:2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.<br>
17:3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.<br>
17:4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.<br>
17:5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.<br>
17:6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.<br>
17:7 But which of you, having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?<br>
17:8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?<br>
17:9 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trough not.<br>
17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 17: 1-10 -- NLT<br>
1 One day Jesus said to his disciples, "There will always be temptations to sin, but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting!<br>
2 It would be better to be thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to fall into sin.<br>
3 So watch yourselves!<br>
("If your brother sins,)<br>
"If another believer sins, rebuke that person; then if there is repentance, forgive.<br>
4 Even if that person wrongs you seven times a day and each time turns again and asks forgiveness, you must forgive."<br>
5 The apostles said to the Lord, "Show us how to increase our faith."<br>
6 The Lord answered, "If you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'May you be uprooted and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you!<br>
7 "When a servant comes in from ploughing or taking care of sheep, does his master say, 'Come in and eat with me'?<br>
8 No, he says, 'Prepare my meal, put on your apron, and serve me whilst I eat. Then you can eat later.'<br>
9 And does the master thank the servant for doing what he was told to do? Of course not.<br>
10 In the same way, when you obey me you should say, 'We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.'"<br>
