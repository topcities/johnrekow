<br>
The Gold Calf<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When the Bible has something very important for us to know and learn,<br>
it will repeat that important message again and again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 20:3 (NLT)<br>
"You must not have any other god but me.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 5:7 (NLT)<br>
"You must not have any other god but me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45:6 (NLT)<br>
so all the world from east to west will know there is no other God. I am the Lord, and there is no other.<br>
<br>
Exodus 34:14 (NLT)<br>
You must worship no other gods, for the Lord, whose very name is Jealous, is a God who is jealous about his relationship with you.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 44:6 (NLT)<br>
This is what the Lord says -- Israel's King and Redeemer, the Lord of Heaven's Armies: "I am the First and the Last; there is no other God.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45:5 (NLT)<br>
I am the Lord; there is no other God. I have equipped you for battle, though you don't even know me,<br>
<br>

Do not tremble; do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim my purposes for you long ago? You are my witnesses -- is there any other God? No! There is no other Rock -- not one!"<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 32:39 (NLT)<br>
Look now; I myself am he! There is no other god but me! I am the one who kills and gives life; I am the one who wounds and heals; no one can be rescued from my powerful hand!<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4:35 (NLT)<br>
"He showed you these things so you would know that the Lord is God and there is no other.<br>
<br>

<br>
Hosea 13:4 (NLT)<br>
"I have been the Lord your God ever since I brought you out of Egypt. You must acknowledge no God but me, for there is no other saviour.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45:21 (NLT)<br>
Consult together, argue your case. Get together and decide what to say. Who made these things known so long ago? What idol ever told you they would happen? Was it not I, the Lord? For there is no other God but me, a righteous God and Saviour. There is none but me.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 43:10 (NLT)<br>
"But you are my witnesses, O Israel!" says the Lord. "You are my servant. You have been chosen to know me, believe in me, and understand that I alone am God. There is no other God --  there never has been, and there never will be.<br>
<br>
<br>

Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.<br>
<br>
Exodus 23:24 (NLT)<br>
You must not worship the gods of these nations or serve them in any way or imitate their evil practices. Instead, you must utterly destroy them and smash their sacred pillars.<br>
<br>
Exodus 20:5 (KJV)<br>
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;<br>
<br>
Exodus 20:5 (NLT)<br>
You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected -- even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 5:9 (KJV)<br>
thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 5:9 (NLT)<br>
You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected -- even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me.<br>
<br>
Commentary: When you bow down to pick up your Christmas present from under the Christmas Tree, what are you really doing?<br>
Is the Christmas Tree really about Jesus? What if that Christmas Tree is actually a worship to Nimrod?<br>
Who is Nimrod?<br>
<br>
Genesis 10: 8-12 -- NLT<br>
8 Cush was also the ancestor of Nimrod, who was the first heroic warrior on earth.<br>
9 Since he was the greatest hunter in the world, his name became proverbial. People would say,<br>
"This man is like Nimrod, the greatest hunter in the world."<br>
(This man is like Nimrod, a great hunter before the Lord)<br>
<br>
(The original Hebrew word used here in the next verse, for the land of Babylonia, was, Shinar.)<br>
10 He (Nimrod) built his kingdom in the land of (Babel) Babylonia, (Shinar,) with the cities of Babylon, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh.<br>
11 From there he expanded his territory to Assyria, (he went out into Assyria, and from that land Assyria went out) building the cities (and the streets of the cities) of Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah,<br>
12 and Resen (the great city located between Nineveh and Calah).<br>
<br>
<br>
When we were in Christian Essays 7,<br>
We mentioned this bit of Scripture when we did the Bible study, titled, Different Languages.<br>
<br>
Genesis 11: 1-9 NLT starting in the last verse of chapter 10<br>
(Chapter 10 just got done giving the list of the clans that descended from Noah's sons.)<br>
32 These are the clans that descended from Noah's sons, arranged by nation according to their lines of descent. All the nations of the earth descended from these clans after the great flood.<br>
1 At one time all the people of the world spoke the same language and used the same words.<br>
2 As the people migrated to the east, they found a plain in the land of Babylonia and settled there.<br>
(The original Hebrew word used here for the land of Babylonia, was, Shinar.)<br>
3 They began saying to each other, "Let's make bricks and harden them with fire." (In this region bricks were used instead of stone, and tar was used for mortar.)<br>
4 Then they said, "Come, let's build a great city for ourselves with a tower that reaches into the sky. This will make us famous and keep us from being scattered all over the world."<br>
5 But the Lord came down to look at the city and the tower the people were building.<br>
6 "Look!" he said. "The people are united, and they all speak the same language. After this, nothing they set out to do will be impossible for them!<br>
(the KJV of verse 6 right here says, the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.)<br>
(Commentary: In the next verse, verse 7, it sounds like the Heavenly Father is talking to his beloved Son, and the Holy Spirit.)<br>
<br>
7 Come, let's go down and confuse the people with different languages. Then they won't be able to understand each other."<br>
8 In that way, the Lord scattered them all over the world, and they stopped building the city.<br>
(That is why the city was called Babel, or Babylon. Babel sounds like a Hebrew term that means "confusion.")<br>
9 That is why the city was called Babel because that is where the Lord confused the people with different languages. In this way he scattered them all over the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jubilees chapter 10 also mentions the Tower of Babel.<br>
The book of Jubilees is not in the Bible anymore, but it can still be found and read on the Internet, and in the Eth Cepher.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The Bible does not say very much about Nimrod.<br>
<br>
Other published books and videos contain commentaries that suggest that Nimrod might have been an evil king that ordered the construction of the Tower of Babel.<br>
<br>
If their single language became many different languages, then it could be that the name of Nimrod became many different names in those many different languages.<br>
<br>
In Hebrew, the meaning of Nimrod is "we will rebel."<br>
<br>
Because of this, Nimrod is often thought to have been a rebel against the Lord.<br>
<br>
The original Hebrew phrasing in the Bible says he was a mighty hunter "before the Lord" (there in Genesis 10:9) which might more literally be translated "to the face of the Lord" -- in other words, in opposition to God.<br>
<br>
This possible translation and interpretation may back up Nimrod's name as The Rebel.<br>
<br>
Since this is a Bible study, and since the Bible has little else to say about Nimrod, we have little else to say about him in this study.<br>
<br>
If you wanted to do your own further research, there are many other books, videos and published works that talk about Nimrod.<br>
<br>
Some possible ideas, maybe true, maybe not true, maybe with supportive evidence, or perhaps not, that some people have suggested about Nimrod, might include any of the following.<br>
<br>
Nimrod May Not Have Been a Real Person.<br>
<br>
Others have recently claimed to have found the actual skeleton of Nimrod.<br>
<br>
Nimrod May Have Been an Evil Man.<br>
<br>
Nimrod Might Have Built the Tower of Babel.<br>
<br>
Nimrod Might Have Been the Basis of the Epic of Gilgamesh -- an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia, perhaps written sometime between 2100 BC and 1800 BC.<br>
<br>
Nimrod Might Have Been a Giant.<br>
<br>
Nimrod's Legend May Have Grown into the Babylonian god Marduk.<br>
<br>
Nimrod May Have Known Abraham.<br>
<br>
Many fake gods, and many of the idols and engravened images and names of other fake gods might have origins that could be traced back to Nimrod.<br>
<br>
Some of the customs, rituals and holidays of fake gods may be traced back to the worship of Nimrod.<br>
<br>
Some of the customs, rituals and holidays that are common and popular in the world today, including the Easter Egg and the Christmas Tree, may be traced back to the worship of Nimrod.<br>
<br>
Many fake and false religions, including the Babylonian religion, and the mixing of the Babylonian religion into the Christian religion, resulting in the Catholic religion, may all be traced back to the worship of Nimrod.<br>
<br>
Every time a skeleton of a giant is found, Catholic people and satanic people steal it and hide it for satanic rituals.<br>
<br>
Satanic people always steal the skeletons of giants with the goal of bringing Nimrod back to life.<br>
<br>
The anti-christ could be Nimrod brought back to life through a mixture of witchcraft, magical arts, medical science and technology.<br>
<br>
On YouTube, and on BitChute and Odysee, (the Odysee website is spelled, O D Y S E E, dot com) -- on those user-made video sharing websites -- there are many people claiming that, Nimrod was trying to use the Tower of Babel to gather together the evil knowledge of the fallen watchers talked about in the book of Enoch. Nimrod was using the Tower of Babel like a sort of college or university where all this evil knowledge could be gathered together.<br>
<br>
When the people were made to speak many different languages, the names of Nimrod and the fake gods, and the evil, unclean spirits, devils and demons made by the fallen watchers, they all suddenly had many different names in many different languages, and the evil knowledge was dispersed into segmented chunks, and some people scattered in one direction, and others went away in other directions, and they each took parts and pieces of their evil knowledge with them.<br>
<br>
The satanic people today are trying to gather this evil information back together again to tap into these evil powers, bringing evil giants, and evil, unclean spirits, devils and demons back to life, using this evil knowledge along with a mixture of witchcraft, magical arts, medical science and technology.<br>
<br>
Even Catholic churches, being strongly influenced by satanic people, will deliberately build their churches right over the top of giant skeleton burial sites, where giants are buried, and places where satanic rituals and satanic sacrifices were done, and also at locations where satanic people have secret demonic portals, gateways, cave entrances and entrances into secret tunnel systems, with gold and wealthy, expensive artefacts.  By building the church building right over the top of it, they can secretly access the gold, Egyptian treasures, valuable artefacts and other secret resources, and they have complete control over the visibility and accessibility of all of their satanic activities and interactions with these secret access locations.<br>
<br>
To cover-up these activities, satanic governments and satanic secret societies and satanic secret brotherhoods steal all of the giant skeletons and other artefacts that prove these things to be true, and then create institutions, like the Smithsonian Institute, which lock away and/or destroy this evidence, so that the satanic educational system can invent a false bunch of lies about the history of the United States, which are programmed into the children at public schools and universities. Many Egyptian writings and artefacts exist which prove that the Egyptians were in the United States Grand Canyon likely long before anyone else. Any evidence that goes against the lies of the satanic government are stolen and locked away into the Smithsonian Institute, which is the real, satanic purpose of this satanic institute.<br>
<br>
These are the kind of things that many people are saying in many hours of these videos, and they share and present documentation and other evidence to prove it. How true is all of this? Well, the history presented in the book of Enoch is calling the United States history textbooks nothing but a bunch of satanic-controlled lies, and that this strange and ridiculous evidence being repeatedly voiced in the crazy videos are actually in close agreement with the true and factual history found in the only real and true history textbook known as the book of Enoch and your Bible.<br>
<br>
All of this is associated with Nimrod and his original operations at the Tower of Babel before the multiple languages broke the evil knowledge all up into disconnected segments.<br>
<br>
What is known today as the Christmas Tree may have originally been an object of worship to Nimrod's male anatomy, and that you are really bowing down to him as you pick up your Christmas present.<br>
<br>
Nimrod and the worship of Nimrod, may have had developed into many of the fake gods, idols, statues and graven images that people worship today, resulting in many of the holidays each year.<br>
<br>
Nimrod and the worship of Nimrod, may have had developed into many of the fake gods, idols, statues and graven images that the Egyptians worshipped.<br>
<br>
<br>
And with the mentioning of Egypt, we're now going to take a look at an important chapter in the Book of Exodus.<br>
<br>
It is Exodus 32.<br>
<br>
Here is a quick review of what happened earlier in this book.<br>
<br>
Exodus 3 -- This is where we read about Moses and the Burning Bush<br>
Exodus 4 -- After seeing demonstrated Signs of the Lord's Power, Moses Returns to Egypt<br>
Exodus 5 -- Moses and Aaron Speak to Pharaoh, and Pharaoh responds by commanding the Hebrew slaves to start Making Bricks without Straw<br>
Exodus 6 -- Moses shares Promises of Deliverance from the slavery in Egypt<br>
Exodus 7 -- Aaron's Staff Becomes a Serpent, and the Plagues begin, starting with A Plague of Blood<br>
Exodus 8 -- A Plague of Frogs, A Plague of Gnats, A Plague of Flies<br>
Exodus 9 -- A Plague against Livestock, A Plague of Festering Boils, A Plague of Hail<br>
Exodus 10 -- A Plague of Locusts, A Plague of Darkness<br>
Exodus 11 -- Death for Egypt's Firstborn,<br>
Exodus 12 -- The First Passover, Instructions for the Passover, and Israel's Exodus from Egypt<br>
Exodus 13 -- Instructions for the Dedication of the Firstborn, Israel's Wilderness Detour<br>
Exodus 14 -- The Egyptians Pursue Israel, and Israel Escapes through the Red Sea on Dry Ground<br>
Exodus 15 -- Moses and the people of Israel sing A Song of Deliverance, and then they heal the Bitter Water at Marah<br>
Exodus 16 -- Manna and Quail from Heaven<br>
Exodus 17 -- Water from the Rock, Israel Defeats the Amalekites<br>
Exodus 18 -- Chapter 18 is very interesting -- This is the original reason why we have a written law, a Torah.<br>
Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, Visits Moses.<br>
Jethro's Wise Advice is for Moses to teach the people God's decrees, God's instructions, God's Law and Commandments so that all of the people do not need to ask Moses constantly for advice on how to settle arguments and disputes.<br>
So, the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, shows up to provide these commandments and instructions.<br>
Jethro sees the problem, and Yaw-Who-Wah provides the solution, the Torah.<br>
<br>
Exodus 19 -- The Lord Yaw-Who-Wah Reveals Himself at Sinai and provides...<br>
<br>
Exodus 20 -- the Ten Commandments for the Covenant Community<br>
and he does not stop at ten. Yaw-Who-Wah continues by giving commandments for the Proper Use of Altars,<br>
Exodus 21 -- Fair Treatment of Slaves, Laws regarding Cases of Personal Injury<br>
Exodus 22 -- Protection of Property, Social Responsibility<br>
Exodus 23 -- A Call for Justice, Three Annual Festivals, A Promise of the Lord's Presence<br>

Exodus 32<br>
All of Exodus 32, all 35 verses -- KJV<br>
<br>
32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.<br>
32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.<br>
32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.<br>
32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.<br>
32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.<br>
32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.<br>
32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:<br>
32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.<br>
32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:<br>
32:10 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.<br>
<br>
32:11 And Moses besought (the face of the LORD) the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?<br>
<br>
32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.<br>
32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.<br>
32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.<br>
32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.<br>
32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.<br>
32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.<br>
<br>
32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,<br>
(neither is it the voice of them that cry for weakness,)<br>
neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.<br>
<br>
32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.<br>
32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.<br>
32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?<br>
32:22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.<br>
32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.<br>
32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.<br>
<br>
32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked;<br>
((for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame amongst those that rose up against them))<br>
(for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame amongst their enemies:)<br>
<br>
32:26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.<br>
32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.<br>
32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.<br>
<br>
32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.<br>
(For Moses had said, fill your hands yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.)<br>
(For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother: that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.)<br>
(And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, because every man hath been against his son, and against his brother, that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.)<br>
<br>
32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.<br>
32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.<br>
32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.<br>
32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.<br>
32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.<br>
32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.<br>
<br>
Commentary: It sounds like everyone's name is written in the Book of Life to begin with, and then some (or many) of the names eventually get erased, blotted out, crossed out, or redacted, because of sin, so that those names are no longer found to be in the Book of Life anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
It sounds kind of like this:  The Book of Life is like a big reservation book of dwelling places in Heaven, and a reservation has already been made in your name for you.  Then an invitation of the Gospel, the Good News is sent to you, and all you have to do is respond and reply to the free reservation. However, you decide not to respond to the invitation, or you ignore it, or you reject it and when your reservation gets cancelled, due to sin or rejecting the invitation of the saviour, your name gets erased or blotted out or otherwise redacted or removed from the Reservation Book. When you show up to the kingdom of Heaven, I'm sorry, but I can't seem to find your name here in this list. It looks like we have no reservation for you, because your name is not found here in the Book of life.  Do you know where people go when they can't enter into the kingdom of Heaven? Hell is an actual, real place. Make sure your name is saved and listed in the Reservation Book, the Book of Life, and a great way to verify that your name is saved in that Reservation list is to start by doing what it says in Romans 10:9.<br>
<br>
<br>
Additionally, as many of you may already know, the names, Jacob and Israel, are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation.<br>

Exodus 32<br>
All of Exodus 32, all 35 verses -- NLT<br>
<br>
1 When the people saw how long it was taking Moses to come back down the mountain, they gathered around Aaron. "Come on," they said, "make us some gods who can lead us. We don't know what happened to this fellow Moses, who brought us here from the land of Egypt."<br>
2 So Aaron said, "Take the gold rings from the ears of your wives and sons and daughters, and bring them to me."<br>
3 All the people took the gold rings from their ears and brought them to Aaron.<br>
4 Then Aaron took the gold, melted it down, and moulded it into the shape of a calf. When the people saw it, they exclaimed, "O Israel, these are the gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt!"<br>
5 Aaron saw how excited the people were, so he built an altar in front of the calf. Then he announced, "Tomorrow will be a festival to the Lord!"<br>
6 The people got up early the next morning to sacrifice burnt offerings and peace offerings. After this, they celebrated with feasting and drinking, and they indulged in pagan revelry.<br>
7 The Lord told Moses, "Quick! Go down the mountain! Your people whom you brought from the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves.<br>
8 How quickly they have turned away from the way I commanded them to live! They have melted down gold and made a calf, and they have bowed down and sacrificed to it. They are saying, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"<br>
9 Then the Lord said, "I have seen how stubborn and rebellious these people are.<br>
10 Now leave me alone so my fierce anger can blaze against them, and I will destroy them. Then I will make you, Moses, into a great nation."<br>
11 But Moses tried to pacify the Lord his God. "O Lord!" he said. "Why are you so angry with your own people whom you brought from the land of Egypt with such great power and such a strong hand?<br>
12 Why let the Egyptians say, 'Their God rescued them with the evil intention of slaughtering them in the mountains and wiping them from the face of the earth'? Turn away from your fierce anger. Change your mind about this terrible disaster you have threatened against your people!<br>
13 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You bound yourself with an oath to them, saying, 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven. And I will give them all of this land that I have promised to your descendants, and they will possess it forever.'"<br>
14 So the Lord changed his mind about the terrible disaster he had threatened to bring on his people.<br>
15 Then Moses turned and went down the mountain. He held in his hands the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant (the two tablets of the Testimony).<br>
They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.<br>
16 These tablets were God's work; the words on them were written by God himself.<br>
17 When Joshua heard the boisterous noise of the people shouting below them, he exclaimed to Moses, "It sounds like war in the camp!"<br>
18 But Moses replied, "No, it's not a shout of victory nor the wailing of defeat. I hear the sound of a celebration."<br>
19 When they came near the camp, Moses saw the calf and the dancing, and he burned with anger. He threw the stone tablets to the ground, smashing them at the foot of the mountain.<br>
20 He took the calf they had made and burned it. Then he ground it into powder, threw it into the water, and forced the people to drink it.<br>
21 Finally, he turned to Aaron and demanded, "What did these people do to you to make you bring such terrible sin upon them?"<br>
22 "Don't get so upset, my lord," Aaron replied. "You yourself know how evil these people are.<br>
23 They said to me, 'Make us gods who will lead us. We don't know what happened to this fellow Moses, who brought us here from the land of Egypt.'<br>
24 So I told them, 'Whoever has gold jewellery, take it off.' When they brought it to me, I simply threw it into the fire -- and out came this calf!"<br>
25 Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get completely out of control, much to the amusement of their enemies.<br>
(Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get completely out of control, and they mocked anyone who opposed them.)<br>
(At the end of this verse, verse 25, The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.)<br>
<br>
26 So he (Moses) stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, "All of you who are on the Lord's side, come here and join me." And all the Levites gathered around him.<br>
27 Moses told them, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Each of you, take your swords and go back and forth from one end of the camp to the other. Kill everyone -- even your brothers, friends, and neighbours."<br>
28 The Levites obeyed Moses' command, and about 3,000 people died that day.<br>
29 Then Moses told the Levites, (Today ordain yourselves for the service of the Lord,)<br>
"Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the Lord, for you obeyed him even though it meant killing your own sons and brothers. Today you have earned a blessing."<br>
30 The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a terrible sin, but I will go back up to the Lord on the mountain. Perhaps I will be able to obtain forgiveness for your sin."<br>
(Perhaps I will be able to make atonement for your sin.)<br>
<br>
31 So Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Oh, what a terrible sin these people have committed. They have made gods of gold for themselves.<br>
32 But now, if you will only forgive their sin -- but if not, erase my name from the record you have written!"<br>
33 But the Lord replied to Moses, "No, I will erase the name of everyone who has sinned against me.<br>
34 Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about. Look! My angel will lead the way before you. And when I come to call the people to account, I will certainly hold them responsible for their sins."<br>
35 Then the Lord sent a great plague upon the people because they had worshiped the calf Aaron had made.<br>

Exodus 32<br>
All of Exodus 32, all 35 verses --<br>
The Targums of Jonathan Ben Uzziel, On the Pentateuch With The Fragments of the Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee<br>
<br>
The Pentateuch, pronounced, Pent-Uh-Hew, is a name for the first five books of the Old Testament, all written by Moses.<br>
<br>
We will not be looking at the Targum Onkelos.<br>
We will just read The Targums of Jonathan Ben Uzziel, and as we read, we will insert the surviving Fragments of the Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee.<br>
<br>
We are not reading the Targum Onkelos because it is very close to what we read in the KJV and NLT, but the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan has some additional content and wording that is worth looking at.<br>
<br>
We will read Exodus 32 in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, here, next.<br>
There are a few things to know before we start reading this targum.<br>
<br>
As mentioned before, when we did a Bible study, titled, Targum Examples, back in Christian Essays 23,<br>
You can generally think of the Targums as a memorised, but paraphrased, recollection of the Hebrew Torah,<br>
translated from Hebrew, to another language, and then translated again into English.<br>
Because it is a paraphrased recollection of Torah, being recalled from one's memory as they create the translation, it has expanded descriptions, expanded explanations, and some commentaries,<br>
all included in the recalled-from-memory, paraphrased translation.<br>
<br>
It can be thought of as an Old Testament Bible paraphrased translation,<br>
that include some thoughts, associated teachings and commentaries,<br>
that were popular, common and traditionally talked about many centuries ago.<br>
<br>
Some of this additional content might be pointing to material found in some of the books that are no longer included in the Bible today.<br>
The books of Jasher, Jubilees, and Enoch, are good examples of these many lost, forgotten books.<br>
They used to be included in the Bible.<br>
You can read these books in English, today, for free, at several places on the Internet, and in the Eth Cepher.<br>
<br>
When reading this recalled-from-memory, paraphrased targum text, here are a few things to know.<br>
<br>
When you see the word, JERUSALEM, in all caps, all uppercase letters, the text there, inside the square brackets, is a Fragment of the Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee.<br>
The Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee only exists today in fragments, and so, when we read some text that also survives in the Jerusalem Targum, that surviving readable titbit is inside the square brackets.<br>
<br>
Hebrew names are in this targum.<br>
The Lord is Yaw-Who-Wah, the Heavenly Father God.<br>
Moses is Moe-Shay, spelled in the targum as M o s h e h.<br>
Aaron is Aw-Ron, spelled A h a r o n, in the targum.<br>
Egypt in the Hebrew language is called, Meets-Rye-EEM, and in the targum, it is spelled,<br>
M i z r a i m.<br>
Here in this targum, we see the name of someone named, Satana, which is spelled,<br>
S a t a n a.<br>
Satana, is the name for the Devil in various languages, a slight variation of Satan.<br>
Just remove the letter a at the end and you have the name of satan.<br>
In Hebrew, satan is called, Haw-Saw-Tawn, which means, the satan.<br>
Issac, is pronounced, EE-Sock in Hebrew, and in this targum, Issac is spelled, I z h a k.<br>
<br>
In the story, we know that Joshua, the son of Nun, hears the voice of the people exulting with joy.<br>
Joshua is the same Hebrew name that Jesus had, and so, it is also pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw, in Hebrew.<br>
The letter J did not not appear until the year 1524.<br>
They did not call him Jesus, because there was no Juh sound or letter J in Hebrew.<br>
Therefore, in the targum that we are about to read,<br>
it will say, Jehoshua heard the voice of the people exulting with joy.<br>
that name, Jehoshua, is actually,<br>
Joshua, pronounced Yaw-Who-Shaw, but it is spelled in the following targum, like this:<br>
J e h o s h u a.<br>
So, that spelling and English pronunciation is wrong, but now that we know better, we're not going to let that slow us down.<br>
And, you know that this Joshua is the same Yaw-Who-Shaw, son of Nun, that will march around Jericho, and the walls came tumbling down, which will happen later on, in the Book of Joshua, Chapter 6.<br>
This is not the Yaw-Who-Shaw in the New Testament that people call Jesus, that died on the cross for our sins; they are two different people that have the same name.<br>
Jesus came to point us to the Heavenly Father, and so he made sure, back in those days, that his first name was a common and ordinary first name, and his appearance was not cute or handsome, so that people would look to the Father and not the son.<br>
As for Jesus, our Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck, it was not his first name that was important, it was his works, not his looks, that gets us saved.<br>
It was not the son, it was who the son was pointing us to, which was, and is, ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah, our Heavenly Father God, who was, and is, and is to come, the same Father yesterday, today, and forever, the first and the last, and He is the beginning and the ending of all that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 53:2 (NLT)<br>
My servant grew up in the Lord's presence like a tender green shoot, like a root in dry ground. There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance, nothing to attract us to him.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 53:2 (KJV)<br>
For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:7 (KJV)<br>
but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:7 (NLT)<br>
Instead, he gave up his divine privileges; he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being. When he appeared in human form,<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, let's now read this chapter 32 targum.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, there are no verse numbers displayed in the targum text.<br>
<br>
In May 2022, this targum was published at the website, targum.info<br>

The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan Ben Uzziel<br>
On the Pentateuch With The Fragments of the Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee<br>
by J. W. Etheridge, M.A.<br>
First Published in the year of 1862<br>
<br>
We will not read the Onkelos targum, just the Pseudo-Jonathan Targum, but both targums are available at the targum.info website.<br>
Again, we will now just read from the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan.<br>
Exodus 32<br>
All of Exodus 32, all 35 verses --<br>
But the people saw that Mosheh (Moses) delayed to come down from the mount, and the people gathered together unto Aharon, when they saw that the time he had appointed to them had passed; and Satana had come, and caused them to err, and perverted their hearts with pride.<br>
And they said to him, Arise, make us gods that shall go before us; for as for this Mosheh the man who brought us up from the land of Mizraim, he may have been consumed in the mountain by the fire which flameth from before the Lord, (and) we know not what hath befallen him in his end.<br>
And Aharon said to them, Deliver the golden rings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me. And their wives denied themselves to give their ornaments to their husbands; and all the people at once delivered up the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aharon.<br>
And he took them from their hands, and bound them in a wrapper, and wrought it with a tool, having made a molten calf; and he said, These, Israel, are thy gods, which brought thee forth from the land of Mizraim.<br>
For Aharon had seen Hur slain before him, and was afraid; and he built an altar before him, and Aharon cried with doleful voice, and said, Let there be a feast before the Lord to-morrow, of the sacrifice of the slain of these adversaries who have denied their Lord, and have changed the glory of the Shekinah of the Lord for this calf.<br>
[JERUSALEM. And Aharon saw Hur slain before him, and was afraid; and he built an altar before him, and Aharon cried and said, A feast.]<br>
<br>
And on the day following, they arose, and sacrificed burnt-offerings; and the people sat around to eat and to drink, and rose up to disport themselves with strange service. [JERUSALEM. And they rose up to disport themselves with strange service.]<br>
<br>
And the Lord said to Mosheh, Descend from the greatness of thine honour; for I have not given thee greatness except on account of Israel.<br>
But now thy people, whom thou didst bring up from the land of Mizraim, have corrupted their works; quickly have they declined from the way which I taught them in Sinai, (that) ye shall not make yourselves image, or figure, or any similitude; for now have they made to them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and sacrificed to it, and proclaimed before it,<br>
These are thy gods, Israel, which brought thee up from the land of Mizraim.<br>
And the Lord said to Mosheh, The pride of this people is manifest before Me, and, behold, it is a people of hard neck.<br>
And now, cease from thy prayer, and cry not for them before Me; for I will let My anger burn like strong fire against them, and consume them, and I will make thee a great people.<br>
<br>
And Mosheh was shaken with fear, and began to pray before the Lord his God; and he said, wherefore should Thy wrath, O Lord, prevail against Thy people whom Thou didst bring up from the land of Mizraim, with great power and with a mighty hand.<br>
Why should the Mizraee who are remaining say, It was for evil that He led them out, to kill them amongst the mountains of Tabor and Hermon, and Sirion and Sinai, and to destroy them from the face of the earth? Turn from Thy strong anger, and let there be relenting before Thee over the evil that Thou hast threatened to do unto Thy people.<br>
Remember Abraham, and Izhak, and Israel, Thy servants, to whom Thou didst swear in Thy Word and didst say to them, I will multiply your children as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have told you will I give to your sons, and they shall inherit for ever.<br>
And there was relenting before the Lord over the evil which He had thought to do unto His people. And Mosheh turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hands, inscribed on their two sides, here and there were they inscribed.<br>
And the tables were the work of the Lord, and the writing was the Lord's writing, inscribed and manifested upon the tables.<br>
<br>
And Jehoshua (Joshua, Yaw-Who-Shaw) heard the voice of the people exulting with joy before the calf. [JERUSALEM. Doing evil.]<br>
And he said to Mosheh, There is the voice of battle in the camp. But he said, It is not the voice of the strong, who are victorious in battle, nor the voice of the weak, who are overcome by their adversaries in the fight; but the voice of them who serve with strange service, and who make merriment before it, that I hear. [JERUSALEM. The voice of them who praise in strange service.]<br>
<br>
And it was when Mosheh came near the camp, and saw the calf, and the instruments of music in the hands of the wicked, who were dancing and bowing before it, and Satana amongst them dancing and leaping before the people, the wrath of Mosheh was suddenly kindled, and he cast the tables from his hands, and brake them at the foot of the mountain;- the holy writing that was on them, however, flew, and was carried away into the air of the heavens;- and he cried, and said, Woe upon the people who heard at Sinai from the mouth of the Holy One, Thou shalt not make to thyself an image, or figure, or any likeness,- and yet, at the end of forty days, make a useless molten calf!<br>
And he took the calf which they had made, and burned it in fire, and bruised it into powder, and cast (it) upon the face of the water of the stream, and made the sons of Israel drink; and whoever had given thereto any trinket of gold, the sign of it came forth upon his nostrils.<br>
And Mosheh said unto Aharon, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought upon them a great sin? And Aharon said, Let not my lord's anger be strong: thou knowest the people, that they are the children of the Just; but evil (Cun-Que-Puh-Sents) concupiscence hath made them to err: and they said to me, Make us gods that may go before us; for this Mosheh, the man who brought us up from the land of Mizraim, is consumed in the mountain, by the flaming fire from before the Lord, and we know not what hath been done to him in his end.<br>
<br>
And I said to them, Whoever hath gold, let him deliver and give it to me; and I cast it into the fire, and Satana entered into it, and there came out of it the similitude of this calf! And Mosheh saw that the people were naked; for they had been stripped by the hand of Aharon of the holy crown which was upon their head, inscribed and beautified with the great and glorious Name; and that their evil report would go forth amongst the nations of the earth, and they would get to them an evil name unto their generations.<br>
[JERUSALEM. And Mosheh saw the people that they were uncovered; for they had been stripped of the golden crown which was upon their head, whereon the Name had been engraven and set forth, at Mount Horeb.]<br>
And Mosheh stood in the sanhedrin gate of the camp, and said, Who feareth the Lord, let him come to me. And there gathered to him all the sons of Levi.<br>
And he said to them, Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, Whosoever hath sacrificed to the idols of the Gentiles, let him be slain with the sword. And now, go, pass through from the gate of the sanhedrin to the gate of the house of judgement, in the camp, and with prayer before the Lord that He will forgive you this sin, take vengeance upon the wicked workers of strange worship and slay, even a man his brother, and a man his companion, and a man his neighbour.<br>
And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Mosheh; and of the people who had the mark in their nostrils there fell that day by the slaughter of the sword about the number of three thousand men.<br>
<br>
And Mosheh said, Offer your oblation for the shedding of the blood that is upon your hands, and make atonement for yourselves before the Lord, because you have smitten a man his son or his brother, and that you may bring a blessing upon you this day.<br>
And it came to pass on the day following, that Mosheh said to the people, You have sinned a great sin; but now I will go up and will pray before the Lord, if haply I may obtain forgiveness of your sin. And Mosheh returned, and prayed before the Lord, and said, I supplicate of Thee, Thou Lord of all the world, before whom the darkness is as the light!<br>
Now have this people sinned a great sin, and have made to them gods of gold; but now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin, forgive; but if not, blot me, I pray, from the book of the just, in the midst of which Thou hast written my name.<br>
<br>
And the Lord said to Mosheh, It is not right that I should blot out thy name; but whosoever sinneth before Me, him will I blot from My book. But now, go lead the people to the place of which I have told thee; behold, My angel shall proceed before thee; but in the day of My visitation I will visit upon them their sin.<br>
And the Word of the Lord plagued the people, because they had bowed themselves to the calf that Aharon had made.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Interesting words there in Exodus 32:6...<br>
KJV: ...and rose up to play.<br>
NLT: ...and they indulged in pagan revelry.<br>
Targum: ...and rose up to disport themselves with strange service.<br>
<br>
Later, in the Targum, we read the part where it said, "And Aharon said, Let not my lord's anger be strong: thou knowest the people, that they are the children of the Just; but evil concupiscence hath made them to err."<br>
<br>
Now there is a word that we may not use often.<br>
It is an English word that is pronounced,<br>
Cun-Que-Puh-Sents<br>
It is spelled, c o n c u p i s c e n c e.<br>
<br>
Let's look up that word, concupiscence.<br>
In May of 2022, we went to the following dictionaries...<br>
<br>
Hodder & Stoughton's Chambers 21st Century Dictionary:<br>
concupiscence means, strong desire, especially sexual, to long for a person in a lustful, sexual way<br>
<br>
<br>
from the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary:<br>
concupiscence means,<br>
sexual desire<br>
<br>
<br>
Collins English Dictionary, by HarperCollins Publishers:<br>
strong desire, especially sexual desire<br>
<br>
the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary:<br>
strong sexual desire<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The targum reminds us that they were expecting Moses back in 40 days, and we know he was busy during those 40 days, writing down all of the Lord's instructions for laws, and commandments, as well as all of the plans on how to make the things for the tabernacle tent of meeting.<br>
<br>
When we get to the end of Day 41, and Moses was late on getting back, they ran out of patience, and so they gave up waiting.  They lived their entire lives in a land filled with graven images and statues and objects of fake gods that were worshipped. Satan detects their weakness and is seen in the targum, influencing them.<br>
<br>
They go back to what they were comfortable and familiar with, and went back to worldly, visual reference points.<br>
<br>
The result is death, killing, and a plague. Christians have done the same thing, even to this day, and the result is similar, with suicide, abortion and being plagued with sexually transmitted diseases and infections that cause cancer, all because they ran out of patience.<br>
<br>
God does not answer prayer based on your personal definition of what you think the schedule or timeline should be.<br>
<br>
Too many so-called Christians decide to walk away and divorce their relationship with Him when they think that their prayers were not answered fast enough, based on a human sinner's understanding and limited perceptions.<br>
<br>
Love is patience.<br>
<br>
I've seen many Christians going to church, and hoping to meet the one they should marry, and when that prayer for marriage is not answered fast enough, according to when they think it should be answered, they give up going to church, and give up doing it God's way, and turn to worldly methods, and go to online dating, doing the boyfriend-girlfriend dating relationship, which is not in the Bible at all, and end up doing sexual activity, resulting in worldly relationships, lowered standards, children without a dad in their life, and accumulated sexually transmitted diseases and infections that cause cancer, all because they ran out of patience.<br>
<br>
God is love, and Love is patience.<br>
<br>
This is true with all of the things that people pray about. Maybe one's prayer is for more money and a job, and when someone's prayers are not answered fast enough, they give up and stop reading their Bible, they stop praying and they stop fellowshipping and going to church, and they go back to worldly, visual reference points, going back to what they are comfortable and familiar with, and what the world says to do, and an evil spirit of apostasy enters in and causes that person to divorce their relationship with the saviour.<br>
<br>
They stop being His servant, and He stops being their master, and satan is standing by with his strategies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We see many times that, the word, patience, in the KJV, ends up being the word, endurance, in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:36 (KJV)<br>
For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:36 (NLT)<br>
Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God's will. Then you will receive all that he has promised.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8:25 (KJV)<br>
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.<br>
<br>
Romans 8:25 (NLT)<br>
But if we look forward to something we don't yet have, we must wait patiently and confidently.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:9 (KJV)<br>
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:9 (NLT)<br>
So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don’t give up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1: 3 & 4 (KJV)<br>
knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.<br>
But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.<br>
<br>
James 1: 3 & 4 (NLT)<br>
For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow.<br>
So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness,<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1: 4-9 -- NLT<br>
4 And because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and precious promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world's corruption caused by human desires.<br>
5 In view of all this, make every effort to respond to God's promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge,<br>
6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness,<br>
7 and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone.<br>
8 The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
9 But those who fail to develop in this way are short-sighted or blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their old sins.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1: 4-9 -- TS2009<br>
4 Through these there have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, so that through these you might be partakers of the Mighty-like nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world, caused by lust.<br>
5 And for this reason do your utmost to add to your belief uprightness, to uprightness knowledge,<br>
6 to knowledge self-control, to self-control endurance, to endurance reverence,<br>
7 to reverence brotherly affection, and to brotherly affection love.<br>
8 For if these are in you and increase, they cause you to be neither inactive nor without fruit in the knowledge of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah.<br>
9 For he in whom these are not present is blind, being short-sighted, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his old sins.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Romans 5:3 (KJV)<br>
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;<br>
<br>

<br>
Hebrews 6:12 (KJV)<br>
that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 6:12 (NLT)<br>
Then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent. Instead, you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God's promises because of their faith and endurance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 15:4 (KJV)<br>
For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.<br>
<br>
Romans 15:4 (NLT)<br>
Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God's promises to be fulfilled.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 5:7 (KJV)<br>
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.<br>
<br>
James 5:7 (NLT)<br>
Dear brothers and sisters, be patient as you wait for the Lord's return. Consider the farmers who patiently wait for the rains in the fall and in the spring. They eagerly look for the valuable harvest to ripen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Jeremiah 10: 1-3 -- KJV<br>
10:1 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:<br>
10:2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.<br>
10:3 For the customs of the people are vain....<br>
(For the statutes of the people are vanity....)<br>
(For the ordinances of the people are vanity....)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10: 1-3 -- NLT<br>
1<br>
Hear the word that the Lord speaks to you, O Israel!<br>
2<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Do not act like the other nations,<br>
who try to read their future in the stars.<br>
Do not be afraid of their predictions,<br>
even though other nations are terrified by them.<br>
3<br>
Their ways are futile and foolish....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10: 1-3 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
1 Hear the word which Yaw-Who-Wah speaks to you, O house of (Israel) Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL).<br>
2 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, "Do not learn the way of the nations, and do not be awed by the signs of the heavens, for the nations are awed by them.<br>
3 "For the laws of these peoples are worthless....<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10:8 -- KJV<br>
(But they are in one brutish and foolish)<br>
(But they are at once brutish and foolish)<br>
10:8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10:8 (NLT)<br>
People who worship idols are stupid and foolish. The things they worship are made of wood!<br>
<br>
<br>
(Jeremiah) 10:8 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
They are both brutish and foolish, an instruction of worthlessness is the tree.<br>
<br>
Wood? Tree?  What tree?  The Christmas Tree?<br>
What is being described here in Jeremiah 10?<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10: 1-8 -- TS2009<br>
1 Hear the word which Yaw-Who-Wah speaks to you, O house of (Israel) Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL).<br>
2 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, "Do not learn the way of the nations, and do not be awed by the signs of the heavens, for the nations are awed by them.<br>
3 "For the laws of these peoples are worthless, for one cuts a tree from the forest, work for the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool.<br>
4 "They beautify it with silver and gold, they strengthen it with nails and hammers so that it does not topple.<br>
5 "They are like a rounded post, and they do not speak. They have to be carried, because they do not walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they do no evil, nor is it in them to do any good."<br>
6 There is none like You, O Yaw-Who-Wah. You are great, and great is Your Name in might.<br>
7 Who would not fear You, O Sovereign of the nations? For this is Your due, for amongst all the wise men of the nations, and in all their reigns, there is none like You.<br>
8 They are both brutish and foolish, an instruction of worthlessness is the tree.<br>
<br>
Commentary: an instruction of worthlessness is the Christmas tree.<br>
These people that worship this, they don't have it in them to do any good.<br>
That is what we see right there in verse 5.<br>
I do not want to ever be described as a person that does not have it in me to do any good.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Thinking about what we saw there, earlier in Exodus 32, verses 4 and 5:<br>
They made a gold object of worship, then they stamped the Lord's name onto it.<br>
Then they planned to have a feast in the name of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
They were not commanded by Yaw-Who-Wah to do that.<br>
They made it up and stamped Yaw-Who-Wah's name on it.<br>
Verse 28 says that, as a result, three thousand people were killed because of that, and<br>
in verse 35, it says that the Lord sent a great plague upon the people because they had worshiped the calf Aaron had made.<br>
Death, killing and a plague, all from inventing a man-made holiday, a man-made graven image, man-made objects and man-made symbols, and then claiming to redeem it by attaching Yaw-Who-Wah's name on the man-made object.<br>
<br>
They had worshiped the calf Aaron had made, and we worship Christmas and many other holidays like it.<br>
The result of doing that was death, killing and a plague.<br>
Do we have a plague in our land right now, with masks and needle pricks?<br>
When are most suicides?  Around Christmas time?  When do people get depressed the most?  Around Christmas time?<br>
<br>
Recall the many Bible studies that we have done here, and we will remember the solution to all of this.<br>
Here's the solution. Have you done all of these steps?<br>
All of you who are on the Lord's side, come here and join me.<br>
Who is on Yaw-Who-Wah's side? let him come unto me.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Step 1. Get Saved -- Believe in the Beloved Son and make Him your Master -- receive His mercy, grace and forgiveness.<br>
Is He your Master?  Are you His servant? Do you think of Him in that kind of way?<br>
<br>
Step 2. Let Him In and Live For Him -- let Him enter into you, like the bread, like the wine or water or grape juice.<br>
Live your life for Him, and not for your own self.<br>
You can't receive the nutritional benefits if you don't let Him enter into you and become one with you.<br>
If you have done that, then that is why He commanded us to do communion, so that we remember that.<br>
He commanded us to do this in remembrance of Him and what He finished on the Cross for us.<br>
<br>
Step 3. His Holy Spirit Living in You fully causes you to obey His commandments fully and completely.<br>
When you have accomplished this step, you will desire and delight to obey all of His commandments, His law, His Torah.<br>
Ask Him to enter in and fill you with His spirit that is Holy and set-apart.<br>
<br>
Step 4. Study the Bible, Obey the Bible and Pray every day.<br>
You can't do this Step 4 right here, if you have not done Steps 1, 2 and 3 first.<br>
<br>
Step 5. Obey The Ten Commandments, and The two greatest commandments, Love God, Love Others, Forgive Others.<br>
If you do not forgive others, then you will not be forgiven, and forgiveness is what we need to live forever in Heaven.<br>
Make His glory and the kingdom of Heaven more important than your own personal interests.<br>
Make the interests of others more important than your own personal interests.<br>
Look for ways to love others, pray for others, help others, with prayer, pray for them, give them your time, your money.<br>
Sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven.<br>
Love those who are in need, love those broken down, love the least of these,<br>
Love those who are damaged and injured and can't show the love and return the love back to you.<br>
Love your enemies and look for ways to help them and bless them.<br>
You love them, with the expectation that they may not be able to love you back.<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 33 and 34 -- NLT<br>
33 "Sell your possessions and give to those in need. This will store up treasure for you in heaven! And the purses of heaven never get old or develop holes. Your treasure will be safe; no thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it.<br>
34 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Step 6. Do the commandments, Do the seven feasts, Holy Days (think of them as Bible, Torah Holidays) and do the days of rest as commanded in the Bible.<br>
Do not work or buy or sell on Sabbath days of rest. Make every Saturday a Sabbath day.<br>
Do the holidays that He commands us to do, which are the Seven Feasts.<br>
Love Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and show Him that love in doing the seven feasts and days of rest.<br>
Try your best to figure out when to do them, and it is your heart and attitude of wanting to do them completely well and right that matters most.<br>
Getting the day wrong, but doing it right, even on the wrong day, is better than refusing to do it.  It is an issue of the heart, not of technical precision.<br>
Keep studying and learning more about it and He will show you how to do it even better next time you do it, and that learning includes improving the precision on how to calculate when to do each feast.<br>
<br>
Step 7. Stop inventing and doing customs, rituals and holidays that are not commanded in the Bible.<br>
Passover? Yes!  Seder (Say-Dur) feast?  Not in the Bible, so don't do it!<br>
Don't let the worldly popularity of a holiday or tradition be the indicator of whether or not you should participate.<br>
<br>
If you are not commanded in the Bible to do that special day, then don't do it!<br>
<br>
Let's finish this study now with a quick prayer.<br>
<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, Dear ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
In the past, I have, and many of us have done holidays and traditions that are not in the Bible.<br>
The Lord Yaw-Who-Wah never commanded us to do those.<br>
In fact, He commands us not to do them.<br>
We did those in the past, and we worshipped the food, the objects and symbols associated with them.<br>
Putting ash on our forehead, wearing costumes, valentine heart shapes, four-leaf clovers,<br>
wine glasses and drinking parties, fireworks, candy and pumpkins, fairy lights on trees,<br>
eggs and bunnies, hot cross buns, wearing crowns made out of paper,<br>
wearing little round hats on our heads, having to put a cloth over our head when we pray,<br>
parties for special sports on TV and watching certain movies on certain days every year,<br>
we have worshipped days and objects and symbols associated with those days.<br>
So, we confess that we need your grace, mercy and forgiveness.<br>
Forgive us ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, and help us do the feasts and Sabbaths that you do command us to do,<br>
and help us not participate in the days, holidays and feasts that you want us to have nothing more to do with.<br>
Help us forget about them, and ignore and stay away from participating in the worshipping of these days and objects that were not commanded by you.<br>
Instead, help us do those seven steps that we were just thinking about.<br>
We thankfully receive your forgiveness. In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, in Jesus' name, Amen, Ah-Main.<br>

You can plop down, and fasten your seat belts, because we are going to be doing a lot of flying around in the Scriptures!<br>
<br>
I wanted to go back to some earlier studies and think about some additional things regarding them.<br>
<br>
<br>
When we were in Christian Essays 7,<br>
we did a Bible study, titled, Money and Possessions.<br>
In that study, we read this...<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 15-23 NLT<br>
15 Then he said, "Beware! Guard against every kind of greed. Life is not measured by how much you own."<br>
16 Then he told them a story: "A rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops.<br>
17 He said to himself, 'What should I do? I don't have room for all my crops.'<br>
18 Then he said, 'I know! I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones. Then I'll have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods.<br>
19 And I'll sit back and say to myself, "My friend, you have enough stored away for years to come. Now take it easy! Eat, drink, and be merry!"'<br>
20 "But God said to him, 'You fool! You will die this very night. Then who will get everything you worked for?'<br>
21 "Yes, a person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God."<br>
22 Then, turning to his disciples, Jesus said, "That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life -- whether you have enough food to eat or enough clothes to wear.<br>
23 For life is more than food, and your body more than clothing.<br>
<br>
This reminds me of someone famous, and he is a good demonstration of this passage here in Luke 12.<br>
<br>
His name was Robert Coleman Atkins.<br>
At the website, Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, it's easy to do a search for his name and read about him.<br>
Here are some selected, quoted bits of information from Wikipedia about this man, along with some thoughts and comments.<br>
<br>
He was a medical doctor. He was rich and famous and successful.<br>
I don't know anything about his relationship with the Heavenly Father and His beloved son,<br>
and I'm not going to try to judge that or give that any thought.<br>
Wikipedia says that his family was Jewish.<br>
From a physical, visual, worldly perspective, he was a good example of a rich and famous and successful person in general.<br>
Dr Atkins was an American physician and cardiologist, best known for the Atkins Diet.<br>
It is a diet based on research that Alfred W. Pennington did during World War II at DuPont.<br>
<br>
The Atkins diet became popular in the early 2000s, with Dr Atkins' book becoming one of the top 50 best-selling books in history, and as many as 1 in 11 North American adults claiming to be following this book and the Atkins Diet.<br>
<br>
He had a successful book, and a successful company that made a variety of food products that could be consumed for those being on the Atkins Diet.<br>
<br>
So, you would think, he has it made, he will be able to ease right on into the senior years of retirement,<br>
Maybe he thought to himself the same thing that we see there in verse 19.<br>
Dr Atkins, you have enough money saved and stored away for years to come. Now take it easy! Eat, drink, and be merry!<br>
Enjoy your rich and successful life.<br>
<br>
He lived to be 72 years old.<br>
What happened?  Was his Atkins Diet not that great? If the Atkins Diet is such great thing, would it keep you healthy and strong and help you live a very long life?<br>
If the Atkins Diet is so good for you, why didn't he live to be of a very old age, being on this Atkins Diet?<br>
<br>
It wasn't the Atkins Diet that killed him.<br>
<br>
I think, he was so busy being successful, that he was not paying attention to where he was walking.<br>
<br>
<br>
On 8 April 2003, Atkins fell and hit his head on an icy New York sidewalk. He was admitted to Weill Cornell Medical Centre, where he underwent surgery to remove a blood clot from his brain, but fell into a coma.<br>
He died nine days later, on 17 April 2003, at age 72.<br>
His successful company, Atkins Nutritionals, Inc., founded by Robert Atkins in order to promote the low-carbohydrate packaged foods of the Atkins diet, filed for bankruptcy two years later, in 2005, following substantial financial losses.<br>
Apparently, they did not know how to run the company without him and his leadership.<br>
It's kind of hard to promote a diet coming from a man that did not live that long.<br>
<br>
So, Dr Atkins reminds me of that teaching that we read there in Luke 12.<br>
Was he a fool? I don't know. I'm not the one to judge. I hope he was not. I hope I am not. I hope you are not.<br>
Luke 12:21 NLT: ...A person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God.<br>

<br>
Awhile back, we had a Bible study, titled,<br>
Moses and The Promised Land<br>
found on Christian Essays 17, also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 17.<br>
<br>
To summarise that real quick,<br>
Moses was supposed to speak to the rock, instead he struck it a second time.<br>
The rock provided water anyway, even though Moses was not following the Lord's instructions.<br>
<br>
The Lord Yaw-Who-Wah provided the correct and expected results, even though the instructions he gave Moses were not followed and obeyed correctly.<br>
<br>
Moses was used for many great things, leading God's chosen people out of the worldly land of Egypt, where they were slaves to a worldly system.<br>
<br>
And he wrote down all of God's commandments, and he tells us with his own handwriting that he wrote them all down.<br>
That's why we know that there is no such thing as oral torah.<br>
<br>
But Moses made many mistakes, and yet The Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah used him and saved him anyway.<br>
Moses did it wrong sometimes, but Yaw-Who-Wah made it all turn out right anyway.<br>
<br>
On that high mountain where Jesus was transfigured, Moses is seen, standing there with Jesus in the promised land.<br>
Moses was not allowed to enter the promised land because of his sin,<br>
but he gets to go into the promised land anyway, because of Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
We were not allowed to enter heaven because of our sin,<br>
be we get to go to heaven anyway, because of Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>
<br>
He was used greatly by God, and yet, he made many mistakes along the way.<br>
I was just trying to remember the mistakes that he made which are in the Bible.<br>
<br>
Here is one mistake that I think he was ashamed of, because he is writing about it and he uses as few words as possible, quickly changing the subject and moving the story along to the next event.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 4: 24-26 KJV<br>
4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.<br>
4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone (a sharp knife), and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet (and made it touch his feet), and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.<br>
4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.<br>
<br>
Exodus 4: 24-26 NLT<br>
24 On the way to Egypt, at a place where Moses and his family had stopped for the night, the Lord confronted him and was about to kill him.<br>
25 But Moses' wife, Zipporah, took a flint knife and circumcised her son. She touched his feet with the foreskin and said, "Now you are a bridegroom of blood to me."<br>
26 (When she said "a bridegroom of blood," she was referring to the circumcision.) After that, the Lord left him alone.<br>
<br>
If you look carefully at the Hebrew language, The Hebrew word for "feet" may refer here to the male sex organ.<br>
So, Moses' wife, took the foreskin and touched Moses with it, and she made that foreskin touch him where?<br>
This note was mentioned in the NLT.<br>
<br>
The Book of Jasher is not in the Bible anymore, but, if we look at an English translation of it,<br>
over at the website, sacred-texts.com<br>
we find this additional information...<br>
<br>
Book of Jasher, Chapter 78: verses 7 through 10<br>
7 In those days Moses, the son of Amram, in Midian, took Zipporah, the daughter of Reuel the Midianite, for a wife.<br>
8 And Zipporah walked in the ways of the daughters of Jacob, she was nothing short of the righteousness of Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah.<br>
9 And Zipporah conceived and bare a son and he called his name Gershom, for he said, I was a stranger in a foreign land; but he (Moses) circumcised not his foreskin, at the command of Reuel his father-in-law.<br>
10 And she conceived again and bare a son, but circumcised his foreskin, and called his name Eliezer, for Moses said, Because the God of my fathers was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.<br>

The Book of Jasher is not in the Bible anymore.<br>
This English translation is from a Hebrew book printed in 1613.<br>
The paper version was printed and published in Salt Lake City,<br>
by J.H. Parry and Company, in the year 1887.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 17: 9 & 10 KJV<br>
17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.<br>
17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child amongst you shall be circumcised.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 17: 9-14 NLT<br>
9 Then God said to Abraham, "Your responsibility is to obey the terms of the covenant. You and all your descendants have this continual responsibility.<br>
10 This is the covenant that you and your descendants must keep: Each male amongst you must be circumcised.<br>
11 You must cut off the flesh of your foreskin as a sign of the covenant between me and you.<br>
12 From generation to generation, every male child must be circumcised on the eighth day after his birth. This applies not only to members of your family but also to the servants born in your household and the foreign-born servants whom you have purchased.<br>
13 All must be circumcised. Your bodies will bear the mark of my everlasting covenant.<br>
14 Any male who fails to be circumcised will be cut off from the covenant family for breaking the covenant."<br>
<br>
Commentary: How many times have we seen this in the Bible? Several times! We have studied this already. Adam obeys Eve (Eat this) instead of the commands of God.<br>
King Saul obeys the demands of the people (don't kill them all) instead of the commands of God.<br>
And now, we see in Jasher 78:9<br>
Moses circumcised not his (son's) foreskin, at the command of Reuel his father-in-law.<br>
Moses obeying his father-in-law instead of the commands of God.<br>
<br>
Obeying someone other than the commands of God is a classic mistake seen again and again in the Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Am I following and obeying someone other than the commands of God?<br>
Is that someone the one I see looking back at me in the bathroom mirror?<br>
<br>
<br>
Moses made other mistakes which he also wrote down.<br>
Someone saw him do it when Moses murdered an Egyptian, which caused him to suddenly leave Egypt and move to the land of Midian.<br>
<br>
Exodus 2: 11 & 12 KJV<br>
2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.<br>
2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.<br>
<br>
And, like I have said before, if you have to look this way and that way to see if anyone is going to see what you are about to do next, maybe that's the Holy Spirit telling you not to do it.<br>
<br>
Exodus 2: 11-15 NLT<br>
11 Many years later, when Moses had grown up, he went out to visit his own people, the Hebrews, and he saw how hard they were forced to work. During his visit, he saw an Egyptian beating one of his fellow Hebrews.<br>
12 After looking in all directions to make sure no one was watching, Moses killed the Egyptian and hid the body in the sand.<br>
13 The next day, when Moses went out to visit his people again, he saw two Hebrew men fighting. "Why are you beating up your friend?" Moses said to the one who had started the fight.<br>
14 The man replied, "Who appointed you to be our prince and judge? Are you going to kill me as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?"<br>
Then Moses was afraid, thinking, "Everyone knows what I did."<br>
15 And sure enough, Pharaoh heard what had happened, and he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in the land of Midian.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 21: 5-9 KJV<br>
21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.<br>
21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents amongst the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.<br>
21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.<br>
21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.<br>
21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 21:6 -- KJV<br>
21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents amongst the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.<br>
<br>
fiery serpents:<br>
burning snakes<br>
saw-rawf naw-khawsh<br>
a saraph or symbolical creature (from their copper colour)<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 21:8 KJV<br>
21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole:<br>
Make thee a saw-rawf<br>
a saraph or symbolical creature (from their copper colour)<br>
In verse 8, the Hebrew does not say, serpent.<br>
A very close and careful study and examination of the Hebrew language of this, in<br>
Numbers 21:8 -- it says in the Hebrew...<br>
make a seraph and put it on a flag or banner, also known as a standard.<br>
This seraph is the same thing seen in Isaiah 6:2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Moses made a snake and put it on a pole.<br>
The Hebrew word for pole, can also mean, a sail, like the large canvas used as a sail on a sailboat.<br>
It can also mean, a flag or banner.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for flag can also mean, a sail.<br>
Looking at this in the Strong's...<br>
a flag; a sail; a flagstaff; making a flag to use as a signal; figuratively a token<br>
a banner, pole, sail, (ensign) sign, standard, a flag or banner that represents something or is used as a signalling device, as in waving a flag to communicate something.<br>
Like, in a race with race cars, a green flag starts the race, a yellow flag warns of a hazard on the track, and a Chequered flag for the End of the race are waved as a way of communicating to the race car drivers.<br>
Those flags are known as status flags, and there are others used besides just those.<br>
<br>
It's the same concept.  The 12 tribes each had their own banner, or flag or standard that represented their tribe.<br>
<br>
So, technically, what Moses made, it may not have been on a pole, exactly.<br>
It could have been a snake sewn or maybe painted onto a large sailboat size canvas or flag fabric material.<br>
It could have been a snake on a flag or banner.<br>
Did Moses obey the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah by making a snake on a pole or flag or banner?<br>
Well, Moses was commanded by God to make a seraph on a flag or banner or pole or standard.<br>
Is a seraph a snake?
<br>
Isaiah 6:2 (NLT)<br>
Attending him were mighty seraphim, each having six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 6: 1-3 KJV<br>
6:1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple (the skirts thereof filled the temple).<br>
6:2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.<br>
6:3 And one cried unto another, (this cried to this) and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 6:2 -- part of the KJV<br>
Above it stood the seraphims:<br>
The Hebrew word for seraphims is saraph.<br>
seraphim is more than one seraph.<br>
saraph here in Isaiah 6:2 is the exact same Hebrew word used in Numbers 21:8.<br>
What Isaiah sees here is the same thing that Moses was supposed to make and put on a pole or flag or banner.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 4:8 (NLT)<br>
Each of these living beings had six wings, and their wings were covered all over with eyes, inside and out. Day after day and night after night they keep on saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty --  the one who always was, who is, and who is still to come."<br>
<br>
Revelation 4:8 KJV<br>
4:8 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and (they have no rest) they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.<br>
<br>
living beings or four beasts:<br>
some kind of living creature, living thing<br>
But the description in Revelation 4 describes many parts that seem to match up with the description of the seraphim in Isaiah 6:2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, saraph, the Hebrew word there in Isaiah 6:2 is the exact same Hebrew word used in Numbers 21:8.<br>
<br>
This means that these six-winged seraphims were flying around with some kind of snake-like part on them that was biting the people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Moses was supposed to make something that looks like the flying six-winged creature that we read about in Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4.<br>
<br>
Technically, Moses was not one hundred per cent wrong.<br>
It could be that the part of the four-winged or six-winged seraphims that did the biting looked like a snake,<br>
and so, Moses might have just made a visual representation of just the biting-like-a-snake part that was on these six-winged seraphims.<br>
<br>
<br>
Did Moses obey God when he made a snake on a pole or flag or banner?<br>
The answer is, technically, no. Moses was supposed to make saraph, not a snake.<br>
A saraph is some kind of six-winged flying creature, and the last time I checked, snakes do not have six wings.<br>
Again, even though Moses disobeyed God ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah, the wrong thing Moses did make still provided the same good results.<br>
Those that got bit by the snake-like part of the six-winged seraphims could look at that wrong pole-flag-banner thing that Moses made, and they would not die from the snakebite.<br>
<br>
We are this way as well. Even though we have done wrong things and have disobeyed His commandments in the past,<br>
ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah is our Master now, and he can still use us for great and good things even if we have made some mistakes along the way.<br>
Try your best to make Him your Master and live your life for Him, and not for your own self and your own selfish interests,<br>
and if you mess up now and then along the way, His love and Mercy and Grace and Forgiveness is faithfully there to pick you back up and keep you running the race with patience.<br>
<br>

Ezra 8:22 (KJV)<br>
...The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.<br>

Ezra 8:22 (NLT)<br>
..."Our God's hand of protection is on all who worship him, but his fierce anger rages against those who abandon him."<br>

Exodus 28 talks about the<br>
Clothing for the Priests<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 28:3 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
Therefore thou shalt speak unto all cunning men, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron's garments to consecrate him (to separate him from the rest), that he may serve me in the Priest's office.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 28:3 -- NLT<br>
Instruct all the skilled craftsmen whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom. Have them make garments for Aaron that will distinguish him as a priest set apart for my service.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 28:3 -- TS2009<br>
"And you, speak to all the wise of heart, whom I have filled with a spirit of wisdom, and they shall make the garments of Aharon, to set him apart, for him to serve as priest to Me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 28:3 -- King James Version (KJV) (1611)<br>
And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yah-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
Give me a new heart, give me a clean heart, and let my new, clean heart be wise hearted.<br>
Let me be, let us be wise hearted, filled with the spirit of wisdom, filled with the holy spirit of wisdom, your seven-fold spirit.<br>
Fill us with your spirit of the holy, the Roo-Awk Hawk-Oh-Desh, and fill us with your love, your joy, your spirit, your presence.<br>
Fill us with your love. Help us love you and love others. Fill us with your wisdom, your desires, your priorities, your directions, your knowledge, and your understanding.<br>
Save us, help us, heal us, perfect us, clean us, cast out of us all hindering sprits, rebuke and cast out all that is wrong within us, heal us, remodel us, and make us new.<br>
In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>

Luke 1:31 (KJV)<br>
And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.<br>
<br>
Matthew 1:21 (KJV)<br>
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Luke) 1:31 (TS2009)<br>
And see, you shall conceive in your womb, and shall give birth to a Son, and call His Name Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>

(Matthew) 1:21 (TS2009)<br>
"And she shall give birth to a Son, and you shall call His Name Yaw-Who-Shaw for He shall save His people from their sins.<br>
<br>
If we quickly consult again our Greek Strong's concordance and other Greek reference books that we have mentioned many times before,<br>
In the Strong's concordance, the name, Jesus -- the Strong's concordance says that it is actually Joshua.<br>
Joshua is the same Hebrew name that Jesus had, and so, it is also pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw, in Hebrew.<br>
The letter J did not not appear until the year 1524.<br>
They did not call him Jesus, because there was no Juh sound or letter J in Hebrew.<br>
There was no J sound used at that time. It was a Y sound only.<br>
So, Joshua was actually pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
This is true for the book of Joshua.<br>
The book of Joshua, and the man, Joshua, who saw the walls of Jericho come tumbling down, and the man called Jesus, both had a same, common first name that is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
The Book of Zechariah, in the Old Testament, directly points to and identifies Jesus as the Messiah.<br>
Jesus Christ is clearly identified in the Old Testament, as Yaw-Who-Shaw, which is the name, Joshua.<br>
Our English translations call Jesus, Joshua, in the Book of Zechariah, and<br>
Joshua is pronounced Yaw-Who-Shaw which is the actual name of Jesus, clearly identified by His actual name in the Hebrew language,<br>
in the book of Zechariah, which is Jesus being clearly mentioned by His actual Hebrew name in the Old Testament.<br>
<br>
The prophet Zechariah brought his messages to the returned exiles of Judah beginning in the second year of King Darius of Persia,<br>
which was in the year, 520 BC.<br>
Although it can be argued that Jesus was not born exactly on the year Zero on our current calendar system,<br>
Maybe He was born around 6 BC or 4 BC.<br>
Most biblical scholars assume a year of birth between 6 and 4 BC.<br>
So, this means that Zechariah is clearly telling us the exact and correct name of Jesus over 500 years before Jesus was born.<br>
And so, Jesus' actual name is Yaw-Who-Shaw, and we were told this more than 500 years before He was born, in the Old Testament.<br>
If you say that Jesus is not found in the Old Testament, then the book of Zechariah is calling you a liar!<br>
<br>
<br>
Zechariah Chapter 3 -- All of Chapter 3, all 10 verses.<br>
KJV<br>
3:1 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and (an adversary) Satan standing at his right hand to resist him (and to be his adversary).<br>
3:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?<br>
3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.<br>
3:4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.<br>
3:5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.<br>
3:6 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,<br>
3:7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk amongst these that stand by.<br>
(Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my ordinance, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee walks to walk amongst these that stand by.)<br>
<br>
3:8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: (they are men of wonder) for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.<br>
3:9 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.<br>
3:10 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat is the LORD of hosts, the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
During the three days that Jesus was dead, he was in Hell, a lake of Fire, and<br>
the LORD of hosts commanded that He be raised up from the dead three days later,<br>
which we see as Him being plucked out of the fire, snatched from the fire, resurrected.<br>
And He is the chief cornerstone that the builders rejected on the earth.<br>
And built upon the chief cornerstone are the believers, the living stones of Heaven, the building blocks of the New Jerusalem.<br>
We are the precious stones of the New Jerusalem, precious stones emitting rainbow colours of light.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 4:3 (NLT)<br>
The one sitting on the throne was as brilliant as gemstones -- like jasper and carnelian. And the glow of an emerald circled his throne like a rainbow.<br>
<br>
Revelation 10:1 (NLT)<br>
Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, surrounded by a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face shone like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 1:28 (NLT)<br>
All around him was a glowing halo, like a rainbow shining in the clouds on a rainy day. This is what the glory of the Lord looked like to me. When I saw it, I fell face down on the ground, and I heard someone's voice speaking to me.<br>
<br>
If New Jerusalem is around or right behind Him, New Jerusalem emits rainbow colours of light, because that is what those precious stones do when absolute, pure light shines upon them and through them.<br>
<br>
1 John 1:5 (KJV)<br>
This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.<br>

Zechariah Chapter 3 -- All of Chapter 3, all 10 verses.<br>
NLT<br>
1 Then the angel showed me Jeshua (Joshua) the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord. (The Satan,) The Accuser, Satan, was there at the angel's right hand, making accusations against Jeshua.<br>
2 And the Lord said to Satan, "I, the Lord, reject your accusations, Satan. Yes, the Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you. This man is like a burning stick that has been snatched from the fire."<br>
3 Jeshua's clothing was filthy as he stood there before the angel.<br>
4 So the angel said to the others standing there, "Take off his filthy clothes." And turning to Jeshua he said, "See, I have taken away your sins, and now I am giving you these fine new clothes."<br>
5 Then I said, "They should also place a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean priestly turban on his head and dressed him in new clothes whilst the angel of the Lord stood by.<br>
6 Then the angel of the Lord spoke very solemnly to Jeshua and said,<br>
7 "This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: If you follow my ways and carefully serve me, then you will be given authority over my Temple and its courtyards. I will let you walk amongst these others standing here.<br>
8 "Listen to me, O Jeshua the high priest, and all you other priests. You are symbols of things to come. Soon I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.<br>
9 Now look at the jewel I have set before Jeshua, a single stone with seven facets (a single stone with seven eyes). I will engrave an inscription on it, says the Lord of Heaven's Armies, and I will remove the sins of this land in a single day.<br>
10 "And on that day, says the Lord of Heaven's Armies, each of you will invite your neighbour to sit with you peacefully under your own grapevine and fig tree."<br>

Zechariah Chapter 3 -- All of Chapter 3, all 10 verses.<br>
The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
1 And he showed me Yaw-Who-Shaw the high priest standing before the messenger of Yaw-Who-Wah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be an adversary to him.<br>
2 And Yaw-Who-Wah said to Satan, "Yaw-Who-Wah rebuke you, Satan! Yaw-Who-Wah who has chosen Yerushalayim rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?"<br>
3 And Yaw-Who-Shaw was dressed in filthy garments, and was standing before the messenger.<br>
4 And He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him." And to him He said, "See, I have removed your guilt from you, and shall put costly robes on you."<br>
5 And I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." Then they put a clean turban on his head, and they put garments on him. And the messenger of Yaw-Who-Wah stood by.<br>
6 And the messenger of Yaw-Who-Wah witnessed to Yaw-Who-Shaw, saying,<br>
7 "Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, 'If you walk in My ways, and if you guard My duty, then you shall also rule My house, and also guard My courts. And I shall give you access amongst these standing here.<br>
8 Now listen, Yaw-Who-Shaw the high priest, you and your companions who sit before you, for they are men of symbol. For look, I am bringing forth My Servant -- the Branch.<br>
9 See the stone which I have put before Yaw-Who-Shaw: on one stone are seven eyes. See, I am engraving its inscription,' declares Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, 'and I shall remove the guilt of that land in one day.<br>
10 In that day,' declares Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, 'you shall invite one another, under the vine and under the fig tree.' "<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Isaiah, in the book of Isaiah, and John, in the book of Revelation,<br>
both say that these creatures have six wings.<br>
Ezekiel says in the Book of Ezekiel that the flying creatures that he saw had four wings.<br>
Some say six wings, and Ezekiel says that they had four wings.<br>
<br>
Moses ended up making a snake on a pole or flag or banner.<br>
<br>
This symbol that Moses made is not the same as the<br>
Caduceus symbol of medicine, commonly used as a symbol of medicine.<br>
At the website, Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, it shows this symbol as<br>
a pole with a globe or ball at the top, and two snakes wrapped around the pole,<br>
and one pair of wings, two wings in total at the top of the pole.<br>
None of those symbolic details match up with anything in the Bible.<br>
In fact, Wikipedia says that<br>
The caduceus is the traditional symbol of Hermes and features two snakes winding around an often winged staff. It is often used as a symbol of medicine, especially in the United States, despite its ancient and consistent associations with trade, liars, thieves, eloquence, negotiation, alchemy, and wisdom.<br>
The modern use of the caduceus as a symbol of medicine became established in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century as a result of well-documented mistakes, misunderstandings of symbology and classical culture.<br>
Hermes is an Olympian deity in ancient Greek religion and mythology. Hermes is considered the herald of the gods. He is also considered the protector of human heralds, travellers, thieves, merchants, and orators. He is able to move quickly and freely between the worlds of the mortal and the divine, aided by his winged sandals. Hermes plays the role of the psychopomp or "soul guide" -- a conductor of souls into the afterlife.<br>
<br>
The correct or more accurate worldly symbol for medicine is the Rod of Asclepius, which has only one snake and no wings.<br>
In Greek mythology, the Rod of Asclepius, also known as the Staff of Aesculapius and as the asklepian (Asklepion), is a serpent-entwined rod wielded by the Greek god Asclepius, a deity associated with healing and medicine.<br>
Asclepius is a hero and god of medicine in ancient Greek religion and mythology. He is the son of Apollo and Coronis, or Arsinoe, or of Apollo alone. Asclepius represents the healing aspect of the medical arts.<br>
<br>
At this point, we can clearly see that the medical symbol commonly seen and used in the world today can be traced back to fake and evil Satanic gods found in Greek mythology.<br>
<br>
So, the snake on a pole that Moses made, and the symbol for medical and medicine that has two snakes on a pole with wings on the pole, these are two different things, and the medical symbol has a history and origin that points to satanic, fake gods of idolatry.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Flying wheels within wheels with eyeballs all around them, and six-winged or four-faced winged flying creatures are not aliens.<br>
They are messengers working for the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
That is not a large, alien spaceship landing, it is the holy city, the new Jerusalem coming down.<br>
Satan will try to trick people into thinking that the sight of such things are aliens from outer space invading earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 3:12 (NLT)<br>
All who are victorious will become pillars in the Temple of my God, and they will never have to leave it. And I will write on them the name of my God, and they will be citizens in the city of my God -- the new Jerusalem that comes down from heaven from my God. And I will also write on them my new name.<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:2 (NLT)<br>
And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.<br>

Isaiah 40:9 (NLT)<br>
O Zion, messenger of good news, shout from the mountaintops! Shout it louder, O Jerusalem. Shout, and do not be afraid. Tell the towns of Judah, "Your God is coming!"<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41:27 (NLT)<br>
I was the first to tell Zion, 'Look! Help is on the way!' I will send Jerusalem a messenger with good news.<br>
<br>
The cherubim described in Ezekiel was what Moses was supposed to illustrate on a pole or sign or flag or banner or standard.<br>
Instead he made a snake on a pole or sign or flag or banner or standard.<br>
Nevertheless, what Moses made, even if inaccurate, did the job anyway, and anyone who looked upon it did not die from the snakebite.<br>
<br>
Read all of Ezekiel 1 and Ezekiel 10 to know what these flying creatures look like.<br>
Again, Wheels within wheels with eyeballs all around and four-faced winged flying creatures are not aliens.<br>
They are messengers working for the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel saw seraphim flying around with four wings.<br>
In Isaiah chapter 6, verse 2, Isaiah says that he saw mighty seraphim, each having six wings.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel saw this when he felt the hand of the Lord take hold of him on 31 July in the year 593 BC, whist sitting beside the Kebar River in the land of the Chaldeans, the land of the Babylonians...<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 1: 4-28 (NLT)<br>
4 As I looked, I saw a great storm coming from the north, driving before it a huge cloud that flashed with lightning and shone with brilliant light. There was fire inside the cloud, and in the middle of the fire glowed something like gleaming amber (like burnished metal).<br>
5 From the centre of the cloud came four living beings that looked human,<br>
6 except that each had four faces and four wings.<br>
7 Their legs were straight, and their feet had hooves like those of a calf and shone like burnished bronze.<br>
8 Under each of their four wings I could see human hands. So each of the four beings had four faces and four wings.<br>
9 The wings of each living being touched the wings of the beings beside it. Each one moved straight forward in any direction without turning around.<br>
10 Each had a human face in the front, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle at the back.<br>
11 Each had two pairs of outstretched wings -- one pair stretched out to touch the wings of the living beings on either side of it, and the other pair covered its body.<br>
12 They went in whatever direction the spirit chose, and they moved straight forward in any direction without turning around.<br>
13 The living beings looked like bright coals of fire or brilliant torches, and lightning seemed to flash back and forth amongst them.<br>
14 And the living beings darted to and fro like flashes of lightning.<br>
15 As I looked at these beings, I saw four wheels touching the ground beside them, one wheel belonging to each.<br>
16 The wheels sparkled as if made of beryl. All four wheels looked alike and were made the same; each wheel had a second wheel turning crosswise within it.<br>
17 The beings could move in any of the four directions they faced, without turning as they moved.<br>
18 The rims of the four wheels were tall and frightening, and they were covered with eyes all around.<br>
19 When the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. When they flew upward, the wheels went up, too.<br>
20 The spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. So wherever the spirit went, the wheels and the living beings also went.<br>
21 When the beings moved, the wheels moved. When the beings stopped, the wheels stopped. When the beings flew upward, the wheels rose up, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.<br>
22 Spread out above them was a surface like the sky, glittering like crystal.<br>
23 Beneath this surface the wings of each living being stretched out to touch the others' wings, and each had two wings covering its body.<br>
24 As they flew, their wings sounded to me like waves crashing against the shore or like the voice of (Shaddai) the Almighty or like the shouting of a mighty army. When they stopped, they let down their wings.<br>
25 As they stood with wings lowered, a voice spoke from beyond the crystal surface above them.<br>
26 Above this surface was something that looked like a throne made of blue lapis lazuli. And on this throne high above was a figure whose appearance resembled a man.<br>
27 From what appeared to be his waist up, he looked like gleaming amber, flickering like a fire. And from his waist down, he looked like a burning flame, shining with splendour.<br>
28 All around him was a glowing halo, like a rainbow shining in the clouds on a rainy day. This is what the glory of the Lord looked like to me. When I saw it, I fell face down on the ground, and I heard someone's voice speaking to me.<br>
<br>
He sees them again in Ezekiel chapter 10.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 10, all of Chapter 10, all 22 verses (NLT)<br>
1 In my vision I saw what appeared to be a throne of blue lapis lazuli above the crystal surface over the heads of the cherubim.<br>
2 Then the Lord spoke to the man in linen clothing and said, "Go between the whirling wheels beneath the cherubim, and take a handful of burning coals and scatter them over the city." He did this as I watched.<br>
3 The cherubim were standing at the south end of the Temple when the man went in, and the cloud of glory filled the inner courtyard.<br>
4 Then the glory of the Lord rose up from above the cherubim and went over to the entrance of the Temple. The Temple was filled with this cloud of glory, and the courtyard glowed brightly with the glory of the Lord.<br>
5 The moving wings of the cherubim sounded like the voice of God Almighty and could be heard even in the outer courtyard.<br>
6 The Lord said to the man in linen clothing, "Go between the cherubim and take some burning coals from between the wheels." So the man went in and stood beside one of the wheels.<br>
7 Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand and took some live coals from the fire burning amongst them. He put the coals into the hands of the man in linen clothing, and the man took them and went out.<br>
8 (All the cherubim had what looked like human hands under their wings.)<br>
9 I looked, and each of the four cherubim had a wheel beside him, and the wheels sparkled like beryl.<br>
10 All four wheels looked alike and were made the same; each wheel had a second wheel turning crosswise within it.<br>
11 The cherubim could move in any of the four directions they faced, without turning as they moved. They went straight in the direction they faced, never turning aside.<br>
12 Both the cherubim and the wheels were covered with eyes. The cherubim had eyes all over their bodies, including their hands, their backs, and their wings.<br>
13 I heard someone refer to the wheels as "the whirling wheels."<br>
14 Each of the four cherubim had four faces: the first was the face of an ox, the second was a human face, the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle.<br>
15 Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the same living beings I had seen beside the Kebar River.<br>
16 When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved with them. When they lifted their wings to fly, the wheels stayed beside them.<br>
17 When the cherubim stopped, the wheels stopped. When they flew upward, the wheels rose up, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.<br>
18 Then the glory of the Lord moved out from the entrance of the Temple and hovered above the cherubim.<br>
19 And as I watched, the cherubim flew with their wheels to the east gate of the Lord's Temple. And the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them.<br>
20 These were the same living beings I had seen beneath the God of Israel when I was by the Kebar River (which is described in Ezekiel 1). I knew they were cherubim,<br>
21 for each had four faces and four wings and what looked like human hands under their wings.<br>
22 And their faces were just like the faces of the beings I had seen at the Kebar, and they travelled straight ahead, just as the others had.<br>
<br>
<br>
Were the Ten Commandments written on a rock of blue sapphire, or, Lapis Lazuli?<br>
Lapis Lazuli is a blue stone.<br>
<br>
When we did a Bible study, titled, Reminders,<br>
which was back in Christian Essays 10,<br>
<br>
In that study, we were looking at the Masculine Hebrew word for a fringe or tassel, which is pronounced, Gah-Deel, which originates from Gah-Dell.<br>
In other places, we also see the Feminine Hebrew word for a fringe or tassel, which is pronounced,<br>
Seat-Sith, or, Seats, or, Sit-Seen.<br>
Some people call these four reminder strings, "Zeet-Zeets" which does not appear to be a very accurate Hebrew word pronunciation,<br>
But it seems apparent that the people that call them "Zeet-Zeets" are getting that idea<br>
from the Feminine Hebrew word for a fringe or tassel.<br>
Just keep in mind that there is also a Masculine Hebrew word that can mean the same thing.<br>
<br>
Some additional thoughts and comments about that Bible study, titled, Reminders,<br>
which was back in Christian Essays 10,<br>
<br>
We are not told to wear a gold cross around our neck.<br>
Instead, we are commanded to wear four fringes or tassels<br>
on the hem of the cloak with which you cover yourself -- on the front, back, and sides.<br>
<br>
Numbers 15: 37-40 (KJV)<br>
15:37 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
15:38 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:<br>
15:39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:<br>
15:40 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22:12 (KJV)
Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.<br>
<br>
A quarter is twenty-five per cent. So, if your body was like a round, analogue clock, your front would be at 12 of the clock, and your backside would be at 6 o'clock.<br>
The expression, Watch your 6, means, to watch your back, and be aware of what is going on behind you, so that no one sneaks up to you from behind.<br>
To divide this clock circle into four equal quarters, you would place the reminders at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock.<br>
Wearing two together on the left and two together on the right is not four equal quarters.<br>
Would your slice a pie into four equal parts in the same way how your wear your reminder strings?<br>
If you were to slice a pie into four equal quarters, the reminder strings should hang at equal distances around if they were to be positioned at four quarters.<br>
<br>
If you are wearing an actual cloak, and you put it on, the four quarters of the cloak, or four corners, hang down and touch each other on your left and right sides, with two on the left and two on the right.<br>
So, having two strings together on the left and two strings next to each other on the right does duplicate the approximate hanging locations of where the reminder strings would have been located if you were wearing a cloak.<br>
<br>
Also, technically, the commandment is that they are to be attached by a blue string.<br>
Using clips or snaps instead of it being sewn on by a blue string is not technically correct, but it is the heart of wanting to wear the reminders that is more important, and that they carry out their function for you, which is...<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 15:40 NLT<br>
40 The tassels will help you remember that you must obey all my commands and be holy to your God.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is traditionally believed that the reason why the reminders use a blue thread is because<br>
the Ten Commandments were written on a blue stone known as lapis lazuli.<br>
There was this blue stone commonly found around on the mountain.<br>
The Lord was seen there on the mountain, standing on lapis lazuli.<br>
It would be easy for him to use lapis lazuli to write the Ten Commandments since it was nearby.<br>
But, technically, the Bible does not specifically say that the stone tablets themselves were blue.<br>
<br>
Targums might say something to that effect, but remember that a Targum is a paraphrased memorisation of Torah with added notes and comments not originally in the Torah written by Moses,<br>
and so a Targum is not as accurate as going directly to the Hebrew scripture wording in the book of Exodus.<br>
<br>
There is a reasonable chance that the Ten Commandments were on a blue stone material, but Moses never said if the stone was or was not blue.<br>
Moses wrote everything down and he added no more, which is why we know that there is no oral torah.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 5:22 (KJV)<br>
These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ancient Hebrews believed that the Ten Commandments were engraved on tablets of a blue sapphire, though historians now believe and argue that the blue gemstone referenced in the Bible may have been lapis lazuli.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4:13 (NLT)<br>
He proclaimed his covenant -- the Ten Commandments -- which he commanded you to keep, and which he wrote on two stone tablets.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 9:11 (NLT)<br>
"At the end of the forty days and nights, the Lord handed me the two stone tablets inscribed with the words of the covenant.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 9:15 (NLT)<br>
"So while the mountain was blazing with fire I turned and came down, holding in my hands the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant.<br>
<br>
Coexist? No! We are a set-apart people, not merged together, not to be unequally yoked.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22: 9-12 NLT<br>
9 "You must not plant any other crop between the rows of your vineyard. If you do, you are forbidden to use either the grapes from the vineyard or the other crop.<br>
10 "You must not plough with an ox and a donkey harnessed together.<br>
11 "You must not wear clothing made of wool and linen woven together.<br>
12 "You must put four tassels on the hem of the cloak with which you cover yourself -- on the front, back, and sides.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 24:10 (NLT)<br>
There they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there seemed to be a surface of brilliant blue lapis lazuli, as clear as the sky itself.<br>
<br>
Exodus 24: 8-13 NLT<br>
8 Then Moses took the blood from the basins and splattered it over the people, declaring, "Look, this blood confirms the covenant the Lord has made with you in giving you these instructions."<br>
9 Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel climbed up the mountain.<br>
10 There they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there seemed to be a surface of brilliant blue lapis lazuli, as clear as the sky itself.<br>
11 And though these nobles of Israel gazed upon God, he did not destroy them. In fact, they ate a covenant meal, eating and drinking in his presence!<br>
12 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain. Stay there, and I will give you the tablets of stone on which I have inscribed the instructions and commands so you can teach the people."<br>
13 So Moses and his assistant Joshua set out, and Moses climbed up the mountain of God.<br>
<br>
Wow! The Lord was seen standing there on a blue stone of brilliant blue lapis lazuli.<br>
Or was he?<br>
<br>
Exodus 24:12 (KJV)<br>
And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.<br>
<br>
Exodus 31:18 (KJV)<br>
And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.<br>
<br>
What was the identification of that stone again?<br>
These books of the Bible, written by Moses, who was right there, just calls it a stone in general and never identifies the name or colour of the stone.<br>
Chances are, it could have been a blue stone, which would explain why the four reminder strings are blue.<br>
<br>
Just to make sure we leave no stone unturned, (pun intended)<br>
we can also check The Book of Jasher.<br>
Going again to The Book of Jasher, looking at an English translation found at<br>
the website, sacred-texts.com<br>
The Book of Jasher can be read for free at this address...<br>
<a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/apo/jasher/index.htm">https://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/apo/jasher/index.htm</a><br>
<br>
The Book of Jasher is not in the Bible anymore.<br>
This English translation is from a Hebrew book printed in 1613.<br>
The paper version was printed and published in Salt Lake City,<br>
by J.H. Parry and Company, in the year 1887.<br>
<br>
The tablets of stone are mentioned four times in The Book of Jasher, Chapter 82.<br>
But even in there, it does not identify the stone or its colour.<br>
<br>
I think the reason why, is because, it is not the stone that is important.<br>
It's the words written on the stone -- the Ten Commandments -- that is truly the important part that needs to be remembered and obeyed.<br>
Don't spend too much time looking at the stone, unless you are going to read the words written on those stone tablets.<br>
Rather than spending all this time trying to identify the stone, maybe we should read and obey the words that were written on that stone.<br>
Read those Ten important commandments written on that stone, remember them, study them and obey them.<br>
When was the last time you carefully read the Ten Commandments?<br>
When was the last time you read the Ten Commandments to your child or children?<br>
<br>
<br>
Wait a minute! They saw God face-to-face and did not die?<br>
Some people, sometimes, were allowed to see Him, and sometimes not.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 9:15 (NLT)<br>
For God said to Moses, "I will show mercy to anyone I choose, and I will show compassion to anyone I choose."<br>
<br>
Which is a quote from...<br>
<br>
Exodus 33:19 (NLT)<br>
The Lord replied, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will call out my name, (Yaw-Who-Wah), before you. For I will show mercy to anyone I choose, and I will show compassion to anyone I choose.<br>
<br>
Exodus 33:19 (KJV)<br>
And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 5:4 (NLT)<br>
At the mountain the Lord spoke to you face to face from the heart of the fire.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 34:10 (NLT)<br>
There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face.<br>
<br>
Exodus 24: 10 & 11 NLT<br>
10 There they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there seemed to be a surface of brilliant blue lapis lazuli, as clear as the sky itself.<br>
11 And though these nobles of Israel gazed upon God, he did not destroy them. In fact, they ate a covenant meal, eating and drinking in his presence!<br>
<br>
Genesis 32:24 (NLT)<br>
This left Jacob all alone in the camp, and a man came and wrestled with him until the dawn began to break.<br>
<br>
Genesis 32:30 (NLT)<br>
Jacob named the place Peniel (which means "face of God"), for he said, "I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared."<br>
<br>
Hosea 12:4 (NLT) -- sounds like Hosea is talking about Jacob...<br>
Yes, he wrestled with the angel and won. He wept and pleaded for a blessing from him. There at Bethel he met God face to face, and God spoke to him --<br>
<br>
John 14:9 (KJV)<br>
Jesus saith unto him, ...he that hath seen me hath seen the Father....<br>
<br>
Exodus 33:20 (NLT)<br>
But you may not look directly at my face, for no one may see me and live."<br>
<br>
Exodus 33:22 (NLT)<br>
As my glorious presence passes by, I will hide you in the crevice of the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.<br>
<br>
The NLT's transliteration of the proper name was corrected in the next passage...<br>
We were looking at verse 19 just a moment ago.<br>
Let's read it again and keep going to verse 23.<br>
<br>
Exodus 33:19-23 (NLT)<br>
19 The Lord replied, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will call out my name, (Yaw-Who-Wah), before you. For I will show mercy to anyone I choose, and I will show compassion to anyone I choose.<br>
20 But you may not look directly at my face, for no one may see me and live."<br>
21 The Lord continued, "Look, stand near me on this rock.<br>
22 As my glorious presence passes by, I will hide you in the crevice of the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.<br>
23 Then I will remove my hand and let you see me from behind. But my face will not be seen."<br>
<br>
No one has ever seen Him, and yet some have seen him?<br>
Is this a contradiction?<br>
<br>
Let's compare...<br>
Exodus 33:19 NLT<br>
I will call out my name, (Yaw-Who-Wah)<br>
that Hebrew word there is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
What about this one...<br>
Exodus 24:10 NLT<br>
10 There they saw the God of Israel.<br>
There they saw the ELL-Low-Heem of Israel (Israel is also pronounced, in Hebrew, Yis-Rye-ELL or Yaw-Shaw-ReLL)<br>
<br>
Sounds like, sometimes He allows it and sometimes He does not.<br>
Paul was not allowed to see God, and John was not allowed to whilst they were here on earth and not yet in Heaven,<br>
but Isaiah was allowed to see God, along with those nobles of Israel.<br>
<br>
1 John 4:12 (NLT)<br>
No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is brought to full expression in us.<br>
<br>
John 5:37 (NLT)<br>
And the Father who sent me has testified about me himself. You have never heard his voice or seen him face to face,<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 6:16 (NLT) -- is this talking about pure light?<br>
He alone can never die, and he lives in light so brilliant that no human can approach him. No human eye has ever seen him, nor ever will. All honour and power to him forever! Amen.<br>
<br>
Numbers 12:8 (NLT)<br>
I speak to him face to face, clearly, and not in riddles! He sees the Lord as he is. So why were you not afraid to criticise my servant Moses?"<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 6:5 (NLT)<br>
Then I said, "It's all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man. I have filthy lips, and I live amongst a people with filthy lips. Yet I have seen the King, the Lord of Heaven's Armies."<br>
<br>
<br>
What about that blue stone material that ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah was standing on?<br>
Sometimes, stones get identified incorrectly in Bible translations.<br>
<br>
Exodus 24:10 (NLT)<br>
There they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there seemed to be a surface of brilliant blue lapis lazuli, as clear as the sky itself.<br>
<br>
Exodus 24:10 (KJV)<br>
and they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.<br>
<br>
NLT says, lapis lazuli.<br>
KJV says, sapphire.<br>
<br>
Those are two different stones. Which one is right?<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word correct answer is, Suh-Peer  -- or -- Sah-Pea-Uh -- and the R sound is rolled at the end.<br>
This means, sapphire. -- so, lapis lazuli is wrong.<br>
Suh-Peer  -- or -- Sah-Pea-Uh -- sounds almost like the English word, sapphire, somewhat, kind of, sort of.<br>
<br>
Moses wrote this Hebrew word down himself and was a direct witness to what he saw.<br>
Moses chose to identify that stone as sapphire and he was there, looking right at it, and wrote that word down himself when he wrote this book of Exodus.<br>
<br>
Why is it important for this to be a sapphire?<br>
<br>
Because, lapis lazuli was not used to build the New Jerusalem, and if it was used, it would turn black because of the pure light of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
Lapis lazuli turns black in pure light.<br>
<br>
It needs to be sapphire, because the sapphire is one of the stones used to build the New Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
The stones used to build the New Jerusalem are all anisotropic, but no one knew that back then, except for God of course.<br>
<br>
Remember this verse?  Here it is again...<br>
1 John 1:5 (KJV)<br>
This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.<br>
<br>
God lives in New Jerusalem, and God is light, pure light, so pure light would be in and shining in and out and all throughout New Jerusalem, and with pure light all around, there are no shadows.<br>
<br>
Revelation 21: 18-20 KJV<br>
21:18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.<br>
21:19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;<br>
21:20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius (Sardis); the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus (chrysoprase); the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Another place that talks about 12 stones is in the 12 stones on the Ephod, which we can read about in Exodus Chapter 28 and Exodus Chapter 39.<br>
Each stone on the Ephod represented one of the twelve sons of Israel, and the name of that tribe was engraved on it like a seal.<br>
The Bible does not clearly tell us which name was engraved onto which stone.<br>
The debate or argument can be, which stone represents which tribe?<br>
Each of the 12 stones are supposed to represent one of the 12 tribes of Israel.<br>
The Bible tells us this in general, but does not clearly communicate this association.<br>
The question is, which gemstone represents which tribe?<br>
We do not clearly know. Because there is argument and debate about the identification of the gemstones,<br>
there is naturally some argument and debate about how to associate a certain gemstone to a particular one of the 12 tribes of Israel.<br>
<br>
By doing some many hours of extensive research in the books of<br>
Job,<br>
Ezekiel,<br>
Jeremiah,<br>
Song of Solomon,<br>
Isaiah,<br>
Daniel and<br>
Revelation,<br>
<br>
one possible example of how each stone could represent a tribe of Israel, would be as follows.<br>
We will quickly take a look at a passage right now in the KJV, and insert one possible example of this association,<br>
from researching the list of Bible books that were just mentioned.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 39: 10-14 -- KJV -- with a possible example of gemstone to tribe associations inserted.<br>
39:10 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a<br>
sardius,<br>
a ruby,<br>
Reuben's stone,<br>
a topaz,<br>
Simeon's stone,<br>
and a carbuncle:<br>
Levi's stone,<br>
this was the first row.<br>
39:11 And the second row,<br>
an emerald,<br>
Judah's stone,<br>
a sapphire,<br>
Issachar's stone,<br>
and a diamond,<br>
Zubulun's stone.<br>
<br>
39:12 And the third row,<br>
a ligure,<br>
Dan's stone,<br>
an agate,<br>
Naphtali's stone,<br>
and an amethyst,<br>
Gad's stone.<br>
<br>
39:13 And the fourth row,<br>
a beryl,<br>
Asher's stone,<br>
an onyx,<br>
Joseph's stone,<br>
and a jasper:<br>
Benjamin's stone.<br>
they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.<br>
39:14 And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve,<br>
according to their names, like the engravings of a signet,<br>
every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ouches of gold may be thought of as<br>
gold filigree which are<br>
delicate designs or decorations made of gold wire,<br>
a delicate ornamentation, a delicate work in gold wire, twisted into convoluted forms,<br>
twisted gold wire.<br>
which basically means that they likely used twisted gold wire to hold each stone in place.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In the past century, it has been discovered that gems can be classified as either anisotropic or isotropic, and only recently have scientists discovered cross polarised light, which can be used to identify whether a gem is anisotropic or isotropic.<br>
<br>
When viewed in crossed-polarised light, similar to "pure" light, anisotropic stones produce a colourful array -- reflecting all the colours of the rainbow, whereas isotropic stones lose all of their colour and appear black.<br>
<br>
It's interesting that, in Revelation chapter 21, there are 12 gems mentioned to be inlaid for the decoration of the New Jerusalem, and ALL of these 12 gems are anisotropic gems, which means that these are all gems that can show a full spectrum of colourful patterns under pure light...<br>
<br>
Interestingly, neither diamond, rubies or garnets are mentioned, despite the fact that those gems are very common! For instance, the precious stones of the world are generally considered to be diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald, with all other gemstones being semi-precious. Turns out, those worldly precious gems are isotropic, which means that, when pure light passes through them, there is no beauty at all...<br>
<br>
What the world says is precious and beautiful really has no beauty in the pure light, and what the world dismisses as not being so valuable really become the most beautiful in the pure light.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's think about this thought right here.<br>
<br>
There is another place that also mentions 12 stones, but it does mention diamonds, in the KJV.<br>
<br>
If diamonds are not of value in terms of how they look under pure light, then why are diamonds mentioned as one of the 12 stones on the Ephod?<br>
<br>
Maybe the King James Version got that gemstone identification wrong?<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the original Hebrew word right there, and see if they mis-identified that gemstone.<br>
<br>
Exodus Chapter 28 talks about<br>
Clothing for the Priests,<br>
the Design of the Ephod, and<br>
the Design of the Chest piece.<br>
<br>
Exodus 28:18 -- King James Version (KJV) (1611)<br>
And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for diamond is, Yah-Hell-Loam<br>
Since Onyx, Jasper, and Emerald are found elsewhere in this list,<br>
the KJV decided to go with, diamond.<br>
Other translations will say that Yah-Hell-Loam is Emerald.<br>
The Strong's thinks that it is onyx, but onyx is listed elsewhere in this list, in the KJV.<br>
<br>
There can be a considerable amount of argument and debate on the exact names of these stones.<br>
<br>
The identification of some of these gemstones is uncertain.<br>
Various English translations can easily make mistakes about the names of these gemstones.<br>
The gemstones should only be anisotropic gems, and if a translation names a gem that is not anisotropic,<br>
then that translation may have made a mistake in the gemstone identification.<br>
<br>
Some gemstones, like Ruby and Sardius, are often interchanged depending on the translation.<br>
Similarly, Chrysolite and Chrysoprase might differ.<br>
Translational variations can affect the identification, especially for gemstones that have anisotropic properties.<br>
<br>
Let's compare the gemstones in Exodus 28: 17-20<br>
with the list in Revelation 21: 18-20<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 28: 17-20<br>

<br>
<br>
The NASB 1995 and the Geneva Bible are both identical:<br>
Jasper<br>

Chalcedony<br>
Emerald<br>
Sardonyx<br>
Sardius<br>
Chrysolite<br>

Jacinth<br>
Amethyst<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jasper appears in both Exodus and Revelation across almost all translations.<br>
Sapphire is a consistent match in both lists in all translations.<br>
Beryl is found in both Exodus and Revelation in several translations (KJV, NASB 1995, NIV, TS2009).<br>
Topaz is another common gem that appears in both lists in many translations.<br>
Amethyst is found in both lists across all translations.<br>
Chrysolite (in some translations) appears in both lists.<br>
<br>
Ruby and Sardius: These two names are sometimes used interchangeably depending on the translation (e.g., Ruby in Revelation in NIV, NLT, and Sardius in KJV, NASB 1995, Geneva Bible). This could be the same gemstone, just named differently in various translations.<br>
Jacinth (or Ligure in older translations) appears in both lists, though not always under the same name.<br>
<br>
There is no exact sequence match between the two lists, but a few patterns can be noted:<br>
<br>
Jasper tends to be listed first or very early in Revelation, whilst it is listed last in Exodus in most translations.<br>
Sapphire is relatively early in both lists, often appearing in the 2nd or 5th position in both passages.<br>
Beryl often falls around the middle of the list in both Exodus and Revelation.<br>
<br>
Both lists contain 12 gemstones, reflecting symbolic completeness (12 tribes of Israel in Exodus, 12 foundations of the New Jerusalem in Revelation).<br>
Many gemstones appear to overlap, suggesting continuity in the biblical symbolism from the Old Testament priestly breastplate (Exodus) to the New Testament vision of the heavenly city (Revelation).<br>
<br>
Whilst there are no strict one-to-one sequence matches between the lists, there are strong similarities in the gemstones mentioned, with certain stones like Jasper, Sapphire, Topaz, Beryl, and Amethyst appearing in both passages across multiple translations.<br>

Bible Hub is a website that is a production of the Online Parallel Bible Project, which began in 2004.<br>
They have an article, titled,<br>
Bible Hub - Exodus 28:17 Commentary<br>
This article says, "There is always considerable difficulty in identifying ancient with modern gems...."<br>
This article discusses the stones in the high priest's breastplate in Exodus and provides insight into their Hebrew names and translations. It also explores how these stones symbolised the 12 tribes of Israel and highlights potential connections with the foundations in Revelation, noting similarities in stone types and arrangement.<br>

<br>
Another webpage they have is titled,<br>
Bible Hub - Revelation 21:19 Commentary<br>
This article focuses on the symbolic meaning of the foundation stones in the New Jerusalem from Revelation 21.<br>
It draws connections to the stones in the breastplate, discussing their colour, origin, and potential spiritual significance.<br>
The article also examines the symbolism of the apostles and how the stones represent aspects of the heavenly city.<br>

<br>
<br>
As we can see, there, in Exodus, Chapter 28, it talks about making a breastplate of judgement with settings of 12 stones.<br>
The 12 gemstones can each represent one of the 12 Tribes of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 28:30 -- King James Version (KJV) (1611)<br>
And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgement the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgement of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually.<br>
<br>
<br>
What is the Urim and the Thummim?<br>
<br>
Those two Hebrew words can mean,<br>
lights and perfection.<br>
<br>
The Urim and the Thummim were used in determining God's decision in certain questions and issues, so that the will of God was revealed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Urim and Thummim, mentioned in Exodus 28:30, are significant components of the high priest's breastplate.<br>
Their names mean "lights" and "perfections" and were used for helping the priest to discern God's will on behalf of Israel.<br>
Various scholars have different views on what the Urim and Thummim actually were.<br>
Some suggest they may have been stones placed within the breastplate that miraculously revealed answers from God, whilst others think they were symbols or inscriptions representing divine truth and justice.<br>
<br>
The Bible mentions that the Urim and Thummim were worn by Aaron, the high priest, over his heart when he entered the sanctuary, symbolising his role in bearing the judgement of the Israelites.<br>
The exact method by which these items communicated divine guidance remains a mystery, but their significance in providing judgement and revelation is emphasized throughout scripture.<br>
Scholars such as Gesenius suggest they could have been small objects, possibly stones, whilst Josephus believed they may have emitted light to indicate divine answers.<br>
Some Christian interpretations see them as foreshadowing Christ, who is considered the light and perfection of wisdom and righteousness.<br>

<br>
Anyway, as we are now getting close to the end of this Bible study, let's go back to the commentary that was mentioned earlier.<br>
<br>
Once again, there in Revelation chapter 21, there are 12 gems mentioned to be inlaid for the decoration of the New Jerusalem, and ALL of these 12 gems are anisotropic gems, which means that these are all gems that can show a full spectrum of colourful patterns under pure light...<br>
<br>
Interestingly, neither diamond, rubies or garnets are mentioned, despite the fact that those gems are very common! For instance, the precious stones of the world are generally considered to be diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald, with all other gemstones being semi-precious. Turns out, those worldly precious gems are isotropic, which means that, when pure light passes through them, there is no beauty at all...<br>
<br>
What the world says is precious and beautiful really has no beauty in the pure light, and what the world dismisses as not being so valuable really become the most beautiful in the pure light.<br>
<br>
Are we talking about gemstones or people? The people following Yaw-Who-Wah and are trying to obey Torah may not look so valuable to the world, but as living stones, we will have the most value and true beauty when we live in the pure light as the living stones of the New Jerusalem, built upon the chief cornerstone.<br>
<br>
The light of the world dwells within us, and we are the lights of the world, shining a pure light that is beautiful, and we do this now as forgiven and saved believers, and we do this later, as living stones in the New Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
Could it be possible that God, in choosing the stones for the foundation of the new temple, deliberately avoided stones that would lose their colour in the presence of His pure light, and instead chose stones that disperse light to produce brilliant rainbow effects?<br>
<br>
Is the rainbow behind or above His head coming from New Jerusalem right behind him or around Him?<br>
In the book of Revelation, are all of the mentionings of rainbow light all coming from New Jerusalem?<br>
<br>
Revelation 4:3 (KJV)<br>
And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe, it's not a literal rainbow, maybe it is all the rainbow-colours of light coming from New Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
This information about the appearance of Jewels in pure light, was made famous by a YouTube video, which talked about<br>
12 Gems in the New Jerusalem, by David Pawson.<br>
<br>
This information has been re-published several times on several different Christian websites.<br>
<br>
As for the one who made this information famous, David Pawson, he was an evangelical minister, writer and prominent Bible teacher based in the United Kingdom.<br>
He was 90 years old when he passed away in the year of 2020.<br>
<br>
He is one of the many people that I am looking forward to meeting one day in the New Jerusalem.<br>
And the time that I wished that I could have spent with you, maybe I'll finally get to have that quality time with you in the New Jerusalem.<br>
I could go on forever, talking about the New Jerusalem, and someday I will.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 17:20 (KJV)<br>
that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 17: 19 & 20 (TS2009)<br>
19 And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, so that he learns to fear Yaw-Who-Wah his ELL-Low-Heem and guard all the Words of this Torah and these laws, to do them,"<br>
20 so that his heart is not lifted up above his brothers, and so as not to turn aside from the command, right or left, so that he prolongs his days in his reign, he and his children, in the midst of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL).<br>

Hosea 14:1 (KJV)<br>
O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 14:8 (KJV)<br>
Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 14, all of Hosea 14, all 9 verses -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
1 O (Israel) Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), return to Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem, for you have stumbled by your crookedness.<br>
2 Take words with you, and return to Yaw-Who-Wah. Say to Him, "Take away all crookedness, and accept what is good, and we render the bulls of our lips.<br>
(and we render the offerings of our lips.)<br>
3 "Ashshur does not save us. We do not ride on horses, nor ever again do we say to the work of our hands, 'Our mighty ones.' For the fatherless finds compassion in You."<br>
4 "I shall heal their backsliding, I shall love them spontaneously, for My displeasure has turned away from him.<br>
5 "I shall be like the dew to (Israel) Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL). He shall blossom like the lily, and strike out his roots like Lebanon.<br>
6 "His branches shall spread, and his splendour shall be like an olive tree, and his fragrance like Lebanon.<br>
7 "Those who dwell under his shadow shall return. They shall revive like grain, and blossom like the vine, and become as fragrant as the wine of Lebanon.<br>
8 "What more has Ephrayim to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after him. I am like a green cypress tree, your fruit comes from Me."<br>
9 Who is wise and understands these words, discerning and knows them? For the ways of Yaw-Who-Wah are straight, and the righteous walk in them, but the transgressors stumble in them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 14, all of Hosea 14, all 9 verses -- NLT<br>
Please note that, in the original Hebrew text, this chapter 14 is divided into 10 verses.<br>
What used to be verse 1 in the original Hebrew text was later put at the end of the previous chapter.<br>
We will start at that last verse of the previous chapter and read into verse 1, going to what is known today as verse 9.<br>
<br>
The people of Samaria<br>
must bear the consequences of their guilt<br>
because they rebelled against their God.<br>
They will be killed by an invading army,<br>
their little ones dashed to death against the ground,<br>
their pregnant women ripped open by swords."<br>
1<br>
Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God,<br>
for your sins have brought you down.<br>
2<br>
Bring your confessions, and return to the Lord.<br>
Say to him,<br>
"Forgive all our sins and graciously receive us,<br>
so that we may offer you our praises.<br>
(Forgive all our sins and graciously receive us,<br>
so that we may repay the fruit of our lips.)<br>
(Forgive all our sins and graciously receive us,<br>
so that we may repay the bulls of our lips.)<br>
<br>
3<br>
Assyria cannot save us,<br>
nor can our warhorses.<br>
Never again will we say to the idols we have made,<br>
'You are our gods.'<br>
No, in you alone<br>
do the orphans find mercy."<br>
4<br>
The Lord says,<br>
"Then I will heal you of your faithlessness;<br>
my love will know no bounds,<br>
for my anger will be gone forever.<br>
5<br>
I will be to Israel<br>
like a refreshing dew from heaven.<br>
Israel will blossom like the lily;<br>
it will send roots deep into the soil<br>
like the cedars in Lebanon.<br>
6<br>
Its branches will spread out like beautiful olive trees,<br>
as fragrant as the cedars of Lebanon.<br>
7<br>
My people will again live under my shade.<br>
They will flourish like grain and blossom like grapevines.<br>
They will be as fragrant as the wines of Lebanon.<br>
<br>
<br>
The original Hebrew in verse 8 says Ephraim, instead of Israel.<br>
It originally said, Ephraim, because it was referring to the northern kingdom of Israel.<br>
<br>
(O Ephraim, stay away from idols!)<br>
8<br>
"O Israel, stay away from idols!<br>
I am the one who answers your prayers and cares for you.<br>
I am like a tree that is always green;<br>
all your fruit comes from me."<br>
9<br>
Let those who are wise understand these things.<br>
Let those with discernment listen carefully.<br>
The paths of the Lord are true and right,<br>
and righteous people live by walking in them.<br>
But in those paths sinners stumble and fall.<br>
<br>

<br>
Parable of the Vineyard is a local fellowship in South West Missouri, also with its own YouTube Channel with many Bible studies, teachings and musical performances.<br>
<br>
By doing a simple search on YouTube for Left and Right Ministries, as well as, Parable of the Vineyard, one can easily find both channels.<br>
<br>
Left and Right Ministries provides several live musical worship performances for Parable of the Vineyard on their YouTube channel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Their song, O Yisrael, was recorded in a studio and officially uploaded onto YouTube on the 2nd day of March 2022.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this song,<br>
Yis-Rye-ELL is a Hebrew way of saying, Israel.<br>
The name of Jacob, in Hebrew, is pronounced, Yah-Cove.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2022 worship song, O Yisrael, by Left and Right Ministries.<br>
<br>
There is a wrestling in our soul<br>
That longs to know our great Ah-Doan<br>
As we wander in the wilderness<br>
We lift our cry up to receive His rest<br>
<br>
Who is our ELL-Low-Heem?<br>
Oh His voice is calling<br>
<br>
<br>
Yis-Rye-ELL lay down your idols<br>
Bow to Yaw-Who-Wah<br>
Let us come to Mount Zion<br>
To praise him alone<br>
