<br>
The Gold Calf<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When the Bible has something very important for us to know and learn,<br>
it will repeat that important message again and again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 20:3 (NLT)<br>
"You must not have any other god but me.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 5:7 (NLT)<br>
"You must not have any other god but me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45:6 (NLT)<br>
so all the world from east to west will know there is no other God. I am the Lord, and there is no other.<br>
<br>
Exodus 34:14 (NLT)<br>
You must worship no other gods, for the Lord, whose very name is Jealous, is a God who is jealous about his relationship with you.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 44:6 (NLT)<br>
This is what the Lord says -- Israel's King and Redeemer, the Lord of Heaven's Armies: "I am the First and the Last; there is no other God.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45:5 (NLT)<br>
I am the Lord; there is no other God. I have equipped you for battle, though you don't even know me,<br>
<br>
Isaiah 44:8 (NLT)<br>
Do not tremble; do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim my purposes for you long ago? You are my witnesses -- is there any other God? No! There is no other Rock -- not one!"<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 32:39 (NLT)<br>
Look now; I myself am he! There is no other god but me! I am the one who kills and gives life; I am the one who wounds and heals; no one can be rescued from my powerful hand!<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4:35 (NLT)<br>
"He showed you these things so you would know that the Lord is God and there is no other.<br>
<br>
1 Kings 8:60 (NLT)<br>
Then people all over the earth will know that the Lord alone is God and there is no other.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45:22 (NLT)<br>
Let all the world look to me for salvation! For I am God; there is no other.<br>
<br>
Hosea 13:4 (NLT)<br>
"I have been the Lord your God ever since I brought you out of Egypt. You must acknowledge no God but me, for there is no other saviour.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45:21 (NLT)<br>
Consult together, argue your case. Get together and decide what to say. Who made these things known so long ago? What idol ever told you they would happen? Was it not I, the Lord? For there is no other God but me, a righteous God and Saviour. There is none but me.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 43:10 (NLT)<br>
"But you are my witnesses, O Israel!" says the Lord. "You are my servant. You have been chosen to know me, believe in me, and understand that I alone am God. There is no other God --  there never has been, and there never will be.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 23:24 (KJV)<br>
Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.<br>
<br>
Exodus 23:24 (NLT)<br>
You must not worship the gods of these nations or serve them in any way or imitate their evil practices. Instead, you must utterly destroy them and smash their sacred pillars.<br>
<br>
Exodus 20:5 (KJV)<br>
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;<br>
<br>
Exodus 20:5 (NLT)<br>
You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected -- even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 5:9 (KJV)<br>
thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 5:9 (NLT)<br>
You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected -- even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me.<br>
<br>
Commentary: When you bow down to pick up your Christmas present from under the Christmas Tree, what are you really doing?<br>
Is the Christmas Tree really about Jesus? What if that Christmas Tree is actually a worship to Nimrod?<br>
Who is Nimrod?<br>
<br>
Genesis 10: 8-12 -- NLT<br>
8 Cush was also the ancestor of Nimrod, who was the first heroic warrior on earth.<br>
9 Since he was the greatest hunter in the world, his name became proverbial. People would say,<br>
"This man is like Nimrod, the greatest hunter in the world."<br>
(This man is like Nimrod, a great hunter before the Lord)<br>
<br>
(The original Hebrew word used here in the next verse, for the land of Babylonia, was, Shinar.)<br>
10 He (Nimrod) built his kingdom in the land of (Babel) Babylonia, (Shinar,) with the cities of Babylon, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh.<br>
11 From there he expanded his territory to Assyria, (he went out into Assyria, and from that land Assyria went out) building the cities (and the streets of the cities) of Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah,<br>
12 and Resen (the great city located between Nineveh and Calah).<br>
<br>
<br>
When we were in Christian Essays 7,<br>
We mentioned this bit of Scripture when we did the Bible study, titled, Different Languages.<br>
<br>
Genesis 11: 1-9 NLT starting in the last verse of chapter 10<br>
(Chapter 10 just got done giving the list of the clans that descended from Noah's sons.)<br>
32 These are the clans that descended from Noah's sons, arranged by nation according to their lines of descent. All the nations of the earth descended from these clans after the great flood.<br>
1 At one time all the people of the world spoke the same language and used the same words.<br>
2 As the people migrated to the east, they found a plain in the land of Babylonia and settled there.<br>
(The original Hebrew word used here for the land of Babylonia, was, Shinar.)<br>
3 They began saying to each other, "Let's make bricks and harden them with fire." (In this region bricks were used instead of stone, and tar was used for mortar.)<br>
4 Then they said, "Come, let's build a great city for ourselves with a tower that reaches into the sky. This will make us famous and keep us from being scattered all over the world."<br>
5 But the Lord came down to look at the city and the tower the people were building.<br>
6 "Look!" he said. "The people are united, and they all speak the same language. After this, nothing they set out to do will be impossible for them!<br>
(the KJV of verse 6 right here says, the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.)<br>
(Commentary: In the next verse, verse 7, it sounds like the Heavenly Father is talking to his beloved Son, and the Holy Spirit.)<br>
<br>
7 Come, let's go down and confuse the people with different languages. Then they won't be able to understand each other."<br>
8 In that way, the Lord scattered them all over the world, and they stopped building the city.<br>
(That is why the city was called Babel, or Babylon. Babel sounds like a Hebrew term that means "confusion.")<br>
9 That is why the city was called Babel because that is where the Lord confused the people with different languages. In this way he scattered them all over the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jubilees chapter 10 also mentions the Tower of Babel.<br>
The book of Jubilees is not in the Bible anymore, but it can still be found and read on the Internet, and in the Eth Cepher.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The Bible does not say very much about Nimrod.<br>
Other published books and videos contain commentaries that suggest that Nimrod might have been an evil king that ordered the construction of the Tower of Babel.<br>
If their single language became many different languages, then it could be that the name of Nimrod became many different names in those many different languages.<br>
In Hebrew, the meaning of Nimrod is "we will rebel."<br>
Because of this, Nimrod is often thought to have been a rebel against the Lord.<br>
The original Hebrew phrasing in the Bible says he was a mighty hunter "before the Lord" (there in Genesis 10:9) which might more literally be translated "to the face of the Lord" -- in other words, in opposition to God.<br>
This possible translation and interpretation may back up Nimrod's name as The Rebel.<br>
Since this is a Bible study, and since the Bible has little else to say about Nimrod, we have little else to say about him in this study.<br>
If you wanted to do your own further research, there are many other books, videos and published works that talk about Nimrod.<br>
Some possible ideas, maybe true, maybe not true, maybe with supportive evidence, or perhaps not, that some people have suggested about Nimrod, might include any of the following.<br>
Nimrod May Not Have Been a Real Person.<br>
Others have recently claimed to have found the actual skeleton of Nimrod.<br>
Nimrod May Have Been an Evil Man.<br>
Nimrod Might Have Built the Tower of Babel.<br>
Nimrod Might Have Been the Basis of the Epic of Gilgamesh -- an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia, perhaps written sometime between 2100 BC and 1800 BC.<br>
Nimrod Might Have Been a Giant.<br>
Nimrod's Legend May Have Grown into the Babylonian god Marduk.<br>
Nimrod May Have Known Abraham.<br>
Many fake gods, and many of the idols and engravened images and names of other fake gods might have origins that could be traced back to Nimrod.<br>
Some of the customs, rituals and holidays of fake gods may be traced back to the worship of Nimrod.<br>
Some of the customs, rituals and holidays that are common and popular in the world today may be traced back to the worship of Nimrod.<br>
Every time a skeleton of a giant is found, satanic people steal it and hide it for satanic rituals.<br>
Satanic people always steal the skeletons of giants with the goal of bringing Nimrod back to life.<br>
The anti-christ could be Nimrod brought back to life through a mixture of witchcraft, magical arts, medical science and technology.<br>
What is known today as the Christmas Tree may have originally been an object of worship to Nimrod's male anatomy, and that you are really bowing down to him as you pick up your Christmas present.<br>
Nimrod and the worship of Nimrod, may have had developed into many of the fake gods, idols, statues and graven images that people worship today, resulting in many of the holidays each year.<br>
Nimrod and the worship of Nimrod, may have had developed into many of the fake gods, idols, statues and graven images that the Egyptians worshipped.<br>
<br>
<br>
And with the mentioning of Egypt, we're going to take a look at an important chapter in the Book of Exodus.<br>
<br>
It is Exodus 32.<br>
<br>
Here is a quick review of what happened earlier in this book.<br>
<br>
Exodus 3 -- This is where we read about Moses and the Burning Bush<br>
Exodus 4 -- After seeing demonstrated Signs of the Lord's Power, Moses Returns to Egypt<br>
Exodus 5 -- Moses and Aaron Speak to Pharaoh, and Pharaoh responds by commanding the Hebrew slaves to start Making Bricks without Straw<br>
Exodus 6 -- Moses shares Promises of Deliverance from the slavery in Egypt<br>
Exodus 7 -- Aaron's Staff Becomes a Serpent, and the Plagues begin, starting with A Plague of Blood<br>
Exodus 8 -- A Plague of Frogs, A Plague of Gnats, A Plague of Flies<br>
Exodus 9 -- A Plague against Livestock, A Plague of Festering Boils, A Plague of Hail<br>
Exodus 10 -- A Plague of Locusts, A Plague of Darkness<br>
Exodus 11 -- Death for Egypt's Firstborn,<br>
Exodus 12 -- The First Passover, Instructions for the Passover, and Israel's Exodus from Egypt<br>
Exodus 13 -- Instructions for the Dedication of the Firstborn, Israel's Wilderness Detour<br>
Exodus 14 -- The Egyptians Pursue Israel, and Israel Escapes through the Red Sea on Dry Ground<br>
Exodus 15 -- Moses and the people of Israel sing A Song of Deliverance, and then they heal the Bitter Water at Marah<br>
Exodus 16 -- Manna and Quail from Heaven<br>
Exodus 17 -- Water from the Rock, Israel Defeats the Amalekites<br>
Exodus 18 -- Chapter 18 is very interesting -- This is the original reason why we have a written law, a Torah.<br>
Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, Visits Moses.<br>
Jethro's Wise Advice is for Moses to teach the people God's decrees, God's instructions, God's Law and Commandments so that all of the people do not need to ask Moses constantly for advice on how to settle arguments and disputes.<br>
So, the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, shows up to provide these commandments and instructions.<br>
Jethro sees the problem, and Yaw-Who-Wah provides the solution, the Torah.<br>
<br>
Exodus 19 -- The Lord Yaw-Who-Wah Reveals Himself at Sinai and provides...<br>
<br>
Exodus 20 -- the Ten Commandments for the Covenant Community<br>
and he does not stop at ten. Yaw-Who-Wah continues by giving commandments for the Proper Use of Altars,<br>
Exodus 21 -- Fair Treatment of Slaves, Laws regarding Cases of Personal Injury<br>
Exodus 22 -- Protection of Property, Social Responsibility<br>
Exodus 23 -- A Call for Justice, Three Annual Festivals, A Promise of the Lord's Presence<br>
Exodus 24 -- Israel Accepts the Lord's Covenant<br>
<br>
Commentary: There is no such thing as Oral Torah.<br>
Moses, by the witness and testimony of his own handwriting, tells us this in Exodus 24:4.<br>
<br>
Exodus 24:4 (KJV)<br>
And Moses wrote ALL the words of the LORD...<br>
<br>
Exodus 24:4 NLT<br>
Then Moses carefully wrote down ALL the Lord's instructions....<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 25 -- The Instructions continue with Offerings for the Tabernacle, Plans for the Ark of the Covenant, Plans for the Table, Plans for the Lampstand<br>
Exodus 26 -- Plans for the Tabernacle, <br>
Exodus 27 -- Plans for the Altar of Burnt Offering, Plans for the Courtyard, Lamplight for the Tabernacle<br>
Exodus 28 -- Clothing for the Priests, Design of the Ephod, Design of the Chestpiece, Additional Clothing for the Priests<br>
Exodus 29 -- Dedication of the Priests,<br>
Exodus 30 -- Plans for the Incense Altar, Money for the Tabernacle, Plans for the Washbasin, Instructions on how to make The Anointing Oil, The Incense<br>
Exodus 31 -- The Lord chooses the Craftsmen, and gives Instructions for the Sabbath<br>
<br>
<br>
And that brings us to the story of The Gold Calf, in Exodus 32.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 32<br>
All of Exodus 32, all 35 verses -- KJV<br>
<br>
32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.<br>
32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.<br>
32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.<br>
32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.<br>
32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.<br>
32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.<br>
32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:<br>
32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.<br>
32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:<br>
32:10 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.<br>
<br>
32:11 And Moses besought (the face of the LORD) the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?<br>
<br>
32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.<br>
32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.<br>
32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.<br>
32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.<br>
32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.<br>
32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.<br>
<br>
32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,<br>
(neither is it the voice of them that cry for weakness,)<br>
neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.<br>
<br>
32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.<br>
32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.<br>
32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?<br>
32:22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.<br>
32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.<br>
32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.<br>
<br>
32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked;<br>
((for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame amongst those that rose up against them))<br>
(for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame amongst their enemies:)<br>
<br>
32:26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.<br>
32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.<br>
32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.<br>
<br>
32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.<br>
(For Moses had said, fill your hands yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.)<br>
(For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother: that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.)<br>
(And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, because every man hath been against his son, and against his brother, that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.)<br>
<br>
32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.<br>
32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.<br>
32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.<br>
32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.<br>
32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.<br>
32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.<br>
<br>
Commentary: It sounds like everyone's name is written in the Book of Life to begin with, and then some (or many) of the names eventually get erased, blotted out, crossed out, or redacted, because of sin, so that those names are no longer found to be in the Book of Life anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
It sounds kind of like this:  The Book of Life is like a big reservation book of dwelling places in Heaven, and a reservation has already been made in your name for you.  Then an invitation of the Gospel, the Good News is sent to you, and all you have to do is respond and reply to the free reservation. However, you decide not to respond to the invitation, or you ignore it, or you reject it and when your reservation gets cancelled, due to sin or rejecting the invitation of the saviour, your name gets erased or blotted out or otherwise redacted or removed from the Reservation Book. When you show up to the kingdom of Heaven, I'm sorry, but I can't seem to find your name here in this list. It looks like we have no reservation for you, because your name is not found here in the Book of life.  Do you know where people go when they can't enter into the kingdom of Heaven? Hell is an actual, real place. Make sure your name is saved and listed in the Reservation Book, the Book of Life, and a great way to verify that your name is saved in that Reservation list is to start by doing what it says in Romans 10:9.<br>
<br>
<br>
Additionally, as many of you may already know, the names, Jacob and Israel, are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation.<br>

Exodus 32<br>
All of Exodus 32, all 35 verses -- NLT<br>
<br>
1 When the people saw how long it was taking Moses to come back down the mountain, they gathered around Aaron. "Come on," they said, "make us some gods who can lead us. We don't know what happened to this fellow Moses, who brought us here from the land of Egypt."<br>
2 So Aaron said, "Take the gold rings from the ears of your wives and sons and daughters, and bring them to me."<br>
3 All the people took the gold rings from their ears and brought them to Aaron.<br>
4 Then Aaron took the gold, melted it down, and moulded it into the shape of a calf. When the people saw it, they exclaimed, "O Israel, these are the gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt!"<br>
5 Aaron saw how excited the people were, so he built an altar in front of the calf. Then he announced, "Tomorrow will be a festival to the Lord!"<br>
6 The people got up early the next morning to sacrifice burnt offerings and peace offerings. After this, they celebrated with feasting and drinking, and they indulged in pagan revelry.<br>
7 The Lord told Moses, "Quick! Go down the mountain! Your people whom you brought from the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves.<br>
8 How quickly they have turned away from the way I commanded them to live! They have melted down gold and made a calf, and they have bowed down and sacrificed to it. They are saying, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"<br>
9 Then the Lord said, "I have seen how stubborn and rebellious these people are.<br>
10 Now leave me alone so my fierce anger can blaze against them, and I will destroy them. Then I will make you, Moses, into a great nation."<br>
11 But Moses tried to pacify the Lord his God. "O Lord!" he said. "Why are you so angry with your own people whom you brought from the land of Egypt with such great power and such a strong hand?<br>
12 Why let the Egyptians say, 'Their God rescued them with the evil intention of slaughtering them in the mountains and wiping them from the face of the earth'? Turn away from your fierce anger. Change your mind about this terrible disaster you have threatened against your people!<br>
13 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You bound yourself with an oath to them, saying, 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven. And I will give them all of this land that I have promised to your descendants, and they will possess it forever.'"<br>
14 So the Lord changed his mind about the terrible disaster he had threatened to bring on his people.<br>
15 Then Moses turned and went down the mountain. He held in his hands the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant (the two tablets of the Testimony).<br>
They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.<br>
16 These tablets were God's work; the words on them were written by God himself.<br>
17 When Joshua heard the boisterous noise of the people shouting below them, he exclaimed to Moses, "It sounds like war in the camp!"<br>
18 But Moses replied, "No, it's not a shout of victory nor the wailing of defeat. I hear the sound of a celebration."<br>
19 When they came near the camp, Moses saw the calf and the dancing, and he burned with anger. He threw the stone tablets to the ground, smashing them at the foot of the mountain.<br>
20 He took the calf they had made and burned it. Then he ground it into powder, threw it into the water, and forced the people to drink it.<br>
21 Finally, he turned to Aaron and demanded, "What did these people do to you to make you bring such terrible sin upon them?"<br>
22 "Don't get so upset, my lord," Aaron replied. "You yourself know how evil these people are.<br>
23 They said to me, 'Make us gods who will lead us. We don't know what happened to this fellow Moses, who brought us here from the land of Egypt.'<br>
24 So I told them, 'Whoever has gold jewellery, take it off.' When they brought it to me, I simply threw it into the fire -- and out came this calf!"<br>
25 Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get completely out of control, much to the amusement of their enemies.<br>
(Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get completely out of control, and they mocked anyone who opposed them.)<br>
(At the end of this verse, verse 25, The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.)<br>
<br>
26 So he (Moses) stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, "All of you who are on the Lord's side, come here and join me." And all the Levites gathered around him.<br>
27 Moses told them, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Each of you, take your swords and go back and forth from one end of the camp to the other. Kill everyone -- even your brothers, friends, and neighbours."<br>
28 The Levites obeyed Moses' command, and about 3,000 people died that day.<br>
29 Then Moses told the Levites, (Today ordain yourselves for the service of the Lord,)<br>
"Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the Lord, for you obeyed him even though it meant killing your own sons and brothers. Today you have earned a blessing."<br>
30 The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a terrible sin, but I will go back up to the Lord on the mountain. Perhaps I will be able to obtain forgiveness for your sin."<br>
(Perhaps I will be able to make atonement for your sin.)<br>
<br>
31 So Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Oh, what a terrible sin these people have committed. They have made gods of gold for themselves.<br>
32 But now, if you will only forgive their sin -- but if not, erase my name from the record you have written!"<br>
33 But the Lord replied to Moses, "No, I will erase the name of everyone who has sinned against me.<br>
34 Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about. Look! My angel will lead the way before you. And when I come to call the people to account, I will certainly hold them responsible for their sins."<br>
35 Then the Lord sent a great plague upon the people because they had worshiped the calf Aaron had made.<br>

Exodus 32<br>
All of Exodus 32, all 35 verses --<br>
The Targums of Jonathan Ben Uzziel, On the Pentateuch With The Fragments of the Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee<br>
<br>
The Pentateuch, pronounced, Pent-Uh-Hew, is a name for the first five books of the Old Testament, all written by Moses.<br>
<br>
We will not be looking at the Targum Onkelos.<br>
We will just read The Targums of Jonathan Ben Uzziel, and as we read, we will insert the surviving Fragments of the Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee.<br>
<br>
We are not reading the Targum Onkelos because it is very close to what we read in the KJV and NLT, but the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan has some additional content and wording that is worth looking at.<br>
<br>
We will read Exodus 32 in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, here, next.<br>
There are a few things to know before we start reading this targum.<br>
<br>
As mentioned before, when we did a Bible study, titled, Targum Examples, back in Christian Essays 23,<br>
You can generally think of the Targums as a memorised, but paraphrased, recollection of the Hebrew Torah,<br>
translated from Hebrew, to another language, and then translated again into English.<br>
Because it is a paraphrased recollection of Torah, being recalled from one's memory as they create the translation, it has expanded descriptions, expanded explanations, and some commentaries,<br>
all included in the recalled-from-memory, paraphrased translation.<br>
<br>
It can be thought of as an Old Testament Bible paraphrased translation,<br>
that include some thoughts, associated teachings and commentaries,<br>
that were popular, common and traditionally talked about many centuries ago.<br>
<br>
Some of this additional content might be pointing to material found in some of the books that are no longer included in the Bible today.<br>
The books of Jasher, Jubilees, and Enoch, are good examples of these many lost, forgotten books.<br>
They used to be included in the Bible.<br>
You can read these books in English, today, for free, at several places on the Internet, and in the Eth Cepher.<br>
<br>
When reading this recalled-from-memory, paraphrased targum text, here are a few things to know.<br>
<br>
When you see the word, JERUSALEM, in all caps, all uppercase letters, the text there, inside the square brackets, is a Fragment of the Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee.<br>
The Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee only exists today in fragments, and so, when we read some text that also survives in the Jerusalem Targum, that surviving readable titbit is inside the square brackets.<br>
<br>
Hebrew names are in this targum.<br>
The Lord is Yaw-Who-Wah, the Heavenly Father God.<br>
Moses is Moe-Shay, spelled in the targum as M o s h e h.<br>
Aaron is Aw-Ron, spelled A h a r o n, in the targum.<br>
Egypt in the Hebrew language is called, Meets-Rye-EEM, and in the targum, it is spelled,<br>
M i z r a i m.<br>
Here in this targum, we see the name of someone named, Satana, which is spelled,<br>
S a t a n a.<br>
Satana, is the name for the Devil in various languages, a slight variation of Satan.<br>
Just remove the letter a at the end and you have the name of satan.<br>
In Hebrew, satan is called, Haw-Saw-Tawn, which means, the satan.<br>
Issac, is pronounced, EE-Sock in Hebrew, and in this targum, Issac is spelled, I z h a k.<br>
<br>
In the story, we know that Joshua, the son of Nun, hears the voice of the people exulting with joy.<br>
Joshua is the same Hebrew name that Jesus had, and so, it is also pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw, in Hebrew.<br>
The letter J did not not appear until the year 1524.<br>
They did not call him Jesus, because there was no Juh sound or letter J in Hebrew.<br>
Therefore, in the targum that we are about to read,<br>
it will say, Jehoshua heard the voice of the people exulting with joy.<br>
that name, Jehoshua, is actually,<br>
Joshua, pronounced Yaw-Who-Shaw, but it is spelled in the following targum, like this:<br>
J e h o s h u a.<br>
So, that spelling and English pronunciation is wrong, but now that we know better, we're not going to let that slow us down.<br>
And, you know that this Joshua is the same Yaw-Who-Shaw, son of Nun, that will march around Jericho, and the walls came tumbling down, which will happen later on, in the Book of Joshua, Chapter 6.<br>
This is not the Yaw-Who-Shaw in the New Testament that people call Jesus, that died on the cross for our sins; they are two different people that have the same name.<br>
Jesus came to point us to the Heavenly Father, and so he made sure, back in those days, that his first name was a common and ordinary first name, and his appearance was not cute or handsome, so that people would look to the Father and not the son.<br>
As for Jesus, our Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck, it was not his first name that was important, it was his works, not his looks, that gets us saved.<br>
It was not the son, it was who the son was pointing us to, which was, and is, ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah, our Heavenly Father God, who was, and is, and is to come, the same Father yesterday, today, and forever, the first and the last, and He is the beginning and the ending of all that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 53:2 (NLT)<br>
My servant grew up in the Lord's presence like a tender green shoot, like a root in dry ground. There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance, nothing to attract us to him.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 53:2 (KJV)<br>
For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:7 (KJV)<br>
but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:7 (NLT)<br>
Instead, he gave up his divine privileges; he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being. When he appeared in human form,<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, let's now read this chapter 32 targum.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, there are no verse numbers displayed in the targum text.<br>
<br>
In May 2022, this targum was published at the website, targum.info<br>
Pentateuchal Targumim<br>
The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan Ben Uzziel<br>
On the Pentateuch With The Fragments of the Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee<br>
by J. W. Etheridge, M.A.<br>
First Published in the year of 1862<br>
<br>
We will not read the Onkelos targum, just the Pseudo-Jonathan Targum, but both targums are available at the targum.info website.<br>
Again, we will now just read from the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan.<br>
Exodus 32<br>
All of Exodus 32, all 35 verses --<br>
But the people saw that Mosheh (Moses) delayed to come down from the mount, and the people gathered together unto Aharon, when they saw that the time he had appointed to them had passed; and Satana had come, and caused them to err, and perverted their hearts with pride.<br>
And they said to him, Arise, make us gods that shall go before us; for as for this Mosheh the man who brought us up from the land of Mizraim, he may have been consumed in the mountain by the fire which flameth from before the Lord, (and) we know not what hath befallen him in his end.<br>
And Aharon said to them, Deliver the golden rings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me. And their wives denied themselves to give their ornaments to their husbands; and all the people at once delivered up the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aharon.<br>
And he took them from their hands, and bound them in a wrapper, and wrought it with a tool, having made a molten calf; and he said, These, Israel, are thy gods, which brought thee forth from the land of Mizraim.<br>
For Aharon had seen Hur slain before him, and was afraid; and he built an altar before him, and Aharon cried with doleful voice, and said, Let there be a feast before the Lord to-morrow, of the sacrifice of the slain of these adversaries who have denied their Lord, and have changed the glory of the Shekinah of the Lord for this calf.<br>
[JERUSALEM. And Aharon saw Hur slain before him, and was afraid; and he built an altar before him, and Aharon cried and said, A feast.]<br>
<br>
And on the day following, they arose, and sacrificed burnt-offerings; and the people sat around to eat and to drink, and rose up to disport themselves with strange service. [JERUSALEM. And they rose up to disport themselves with strange service.]<br>
<br>
And the Lord said to Mosheh, Descend from the greatness of thine honour; for I have not given thee greatness except on account of Israel.<br>
But now thy people, whom thou didst bring up from the land of Mizraim, have corrupted their works; quickly have they declined from the way which I taught them in Sinai, (that) ye shall not make yourselves image, or figure, or any similitude; for now have they made to them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and sacrificed to it, and proclaimed before it,<br>
These are thy gods, Israel, which brought thee up from the land of Mizraim.<br>
And the Lord said to Mosheh, The pride of this people is manifest before Me, and, behold, it is a people of hard neck.<br>
And now, cease from thy prayer, and cry not for them before Me; for I will let My anger burn like strong fire against them, and consume them, and I will make thee a great people.<br>
<br>
And Mosheh was shaken with fear, and began to pray before the Lord his God; and he said, wherefore should Thy wrath, O Lord, prevail against Thy people whom Thou didst bring up from the land of Mizraim, with great power and with a mighty hand.<br>
Why should the Mizraee who are remaining say, It was for evil that He led them out, to kill them amongst the mountains of Tabor and Hermon, and Sirion and Sinai, and to destroy them from the face of the earth? Turn from Thy strong anger, and let there be relenting before Thee over the evil that Thou hast threatened to do unto Thy people.<br>
Remember Abraham, and Izhak, and Israel, Thy servants, to whom Thou didst swear in Thy Word and didst say to them, I will multiply your children as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have told you will I give to your sons, and they shall inherit for ever.<br>
And there was relenting before the Lord over the evil which He had thought to do unto His people. And Mosheh turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hands, inscribed on their two sides, here and there were they inscribed.<br>
And the tables were the work of the Lord, and the writing was the Lord's writing, inscribed and manifested upon the tables.<br>
<br>
And Jehoshua (Joshua, Yaw-Who-Shaw) heard the voice of the people exulting with joy before the calf. [JERUSALEM. Doing evil.]<br>
And he said to Mosheh, There is the voice of battle in the camp. But he said, It is not the voice of the strong, who are victorious in battle, nor the voice of the weak, who are overcome by their adversaries in the fight; but the voice of them who serve with strange service, and who make merriment before it, that I hear. [JERUSALEM. The voice of them who praise in strange service.]<br>
<br>
And it was when Mosheh came near the camp, and saw the calf, and the instruments of music in the hands of the wicked, who were dancing and bowing before it, and Satana amongst them dancing and leaping before the people, the wrath of Mosheh was suddenly kindled, and he cast the tables from his hands, and brake them at the foot of the mountain;- the holy writing that was on them, however, flew, and was carried away into the air of the heavens;- and he cried, and said, Woe upon the people who heard at Sinai from the mouth of the Holy One, Thou shalt not make to thyself an image, or figure, or any likeness,- and yet, at the end of forty days, make a useless molten calf!<br>
And he took the calf which they had made, and burned it in fire, and bruised it into powder, and cast (it) upon the face of the water of the stream, and made the sons of Israel drink; and whoever had given thereto any trinket of gold, the sign of it came forth upon his nostrils.<br>
And Mosheh said unto Aharon, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought upon them a great sin? And Aharon said, Let not my lord's anger be strong: thou knowest the people, that they are the children of the Just; but evil (Cun-Que-Puh-Sents) concupiscence hath made them to err: and they said to me, Make us gods that may go before us; for this Mosheh, the man who brought us up from the land of Mizraim, is consumed in the mountain, by the flaming fire from before the Lord, and we know not what hath been done to him in his end.<br>
<br>
And I said to them, Whoever hath gold, let him deliver and give it to me; and I cast it into the fire, and Satana entered into it, and there came out of it the similitude of this calf! And Mosheh saw that the people were naked; for they had been stripped by the hand of Aharon of the holy crown which was upon their head, inscribed and beautified with the great and glorious Name; and that their evil report would go forth amongst the nations of the earth, and they would get to them an evil name unto their generations.<br>
[JERUSALEM. And Mosheh saw the people that they were uncovered; for they had been stripped of the golden crown which was upon their head, whereon the Name had been engraven and set forth, at Mount Horeb.]<br>
And Mosheh stood in the sanhedrin gate of the camp, and said, Who feareth the Lord, let him come to me. And there gathered to him all the sons of Levi.<br>
And he said to them, Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, Whosoever hath sacrificed to the idols of the Gentiles, let him be slain with the sword. And now, go, pass through from the gate of the sanhedrin to the gate of the house of judgement, in the camp, and with prayer before the Lord that He will forgive you this sin, take vengeance upon the wicked workers of strange worship and slay, even a man his brother, and a man his companion, and a man his neighbour.<br>
And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Mosheh; and of the people who had the mark in their nostrils there fell that day by the slaughter of the sword about the number of three thousand men.<br>
<br>
And Mosheh said, Offer your oblation for the shedding of the blood that is upon your hands, and make atonement for yourselves before the Lord, because you have smitten a man his son or his brother, and that you may bring a blessing upon you this day.<br>
And it came to pass on the day following, that Mosheh said to the people, You have sinned a great sin; but now I will go up and will pray before the Lord, if haply I may obtain forgiveness of your sin. And Mosheh returned, and prayed before the Lord, and said, I supplicate of Thee, Thou Lord of all the world, before whom the darkness is as the light!<br>
Now have this people sinned a great sin, and have made to them gods of gold; but now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin, forgive; but if not, blot me, I pray, from the book of the just, in the midst of which Thou hast written my name.<br>
<br>
And the Lord said to Mosheh, It is not right that I should blot out thy name; but whosoever sinneth before Me, him will I blot from My book. But now, go lead the people to the place of which I have told thee; behold, My angel shall proceed before thee; but in the day of My visitation I will visit upon them their sin.<br>
And the Word of the Lord plagued the people, because they had bowed themselves to the calf that Aharon had made.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Interesting words there in Exodus 32:6...<br>
KJV: ...and rose up to play.<br>
NLT: ...and they indulged in pagan revelry.<br>
Targum: ...and rose up to disport themselves with strange service.<br>
<br>
Later, in the Targum, we read the part where it said, "And Aharon said, Let not my lord's anger be strong: thou knowest the people, that they are the children of the Just; but evil concupiscence hath made them to err."<br>
<br>
Now there is a word that we may not use often.<br>
It is an English word that is pronounced,<br>
Cun-Que-Puh-Sents<br>
It is spelled, c o n c u p i s c e n c e.<br>
<br>
Let's look up that word, concupiscence.<br>
In May of 2022, we went to the following dictionaries...<br>
<br>
Hodder & Stoughton's Chambers 21st Century Dictionary:<br>
concupiscence means, strong desire, especially sexual, to long for a person in a lustful, sexual way<br>
<br>
<br>
from the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary:<br>
concupiscence means,<br>
sexual desire<br>
<br>
<br>
Collins English Dictionary, by HarperCollins Publishers:<br>
strong desire, especially sexual desire<br>
<br>
the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary:<br>
strong sexual desire<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The targum reminds us that they were expecting Moses back in 40 days, and we know he was busy during those 40 days, writing down all of the Lord's instructions for laws, and commandments, as well as all of the plans on how to make the things for the tabernacle tent of meeting.<br>
<br>
When we get to the end of Day 41, and Moses was late on getting back, they ran out of patience, and so they gave up waiting.  They lived their entire lives in a land filled with graven images and statues and objects of fake gods that were worshipped. Satan detects their weakness and is seen in the targum, influencing them.<br>
<br>
They go back to what they were comfortable and familiar with, and went back to worldly, visual reference points.<br>
<br>
The result is death, killing, and a plague. Christians have done the same thing, even to this day, and the result is similar, with suicide, abortion and being plagued with sexually transmitted diseases and infections that cause cancer, all because they ran out of patience.<br>
<br>
God does not answer prayer based on your personal definition of what you think the schedule or timeline should be.<br>
<br>
Too many so-called Christians decide to walk away and divorce their relationship with Him when they think that their prayers were not answered fast enough, based on a human sinner's understanding and limited perceptions.<br>
<br>
Love is patience.<br>
<br>
I've seen many Christians going to church, and hoping to meet the one they should marry, and when that prayer for marriage is not answered fast enough, according to when they think it should be answered, they give up going to church, and give up doing it God's way, and turn to worldly methods, and go to online dating, doing the boyfriend-girlfriend dating relationship, which is not in the Bible at all, and end up doing sexual activity, resulting in worldly relationships, lowered standards, children without a dad in their life, and accumulated sexually transmitted diseases and infections that cause cancer, all because they ran out of patience.<br>
<br>
God is love, and Love is patience.<br>
<br>
This is true with all of the things that people pray about. Maybe one's prayer is for more money and a job, and when someone's prayers are not answered fast enough, they give up and stop reading their Bible, they stop praying and they stop fellowshipping and going to church, and they go back to worldly, visual reference points, going back to what they are comfortable and familiar with, and what the world says to do, and an evil spirit of apostasy enters in and causes that person to divorce their relationship with the saviour.<br>
<br>
They stop being His servant, and He stops being their master, and satan is standing by with his strategies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We see many times that, the word, patience, in the KJV, ends up being the word, endurance, in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:36 (KJV)<br>
For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:36 (NLT)<br>
Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God's will. Then you will receive all that he has promised.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8:25 (KJV)<br>
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.<br>
<br>
Romans 8:25 (NLT)<br>
But if we look forward to something we don't yet have, we must wait patiently and confidently.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:9 (KJV)<br>
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:9 (NLT)<br>
So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don’t give up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1: 3 & 4 (KJV)<br>
knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.<br>
But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.<br>
<br>
James 1: 3 & 4 (NLT)<br>
For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow.<br>
So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1:6 (KJV)<br>
and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1:6 (NLT)<br>
and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness,<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1: 4-9 -- NLT<br>
4 And because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and precious promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world's corruption caused by human desires.<br>
5 In view of all this, make every effort to respond to God's promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge,<br>
6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness,<br>
7 and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone.<br>
8 The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
9 But those who fail to develop in this way are short-sighted or blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their old sins.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 1: 4-9 -- TS2009<br>
4 Through these there have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, so that through these you might be partakers of the Mighty-like nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world, caused by lust.<br>
5 And for this reason do your utmost to add to your belief uprightness, to uprightness knowledge,<br>
6 to knowledge self-control, to self-control endurance, to endurance reverence,<br>
7 to reverence brotherly affection, and to brotherly affection love.<br>
8 For if these are in you and increase, they cause you to be neither inactive nor without fruit in the knowledge of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah.<br>
9 For he in whom these are not present is blind, being short-sighted, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his old sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 5:3 (KJV)<br>
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;<br>
<br>
Romans 5:3 (NLT)<br>
We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 6:12 (KJV)<br>
that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 6:12 (NLT)<br>
Then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent. Instead, you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God's promises because of their faith and endurance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 15:4 (KJV)<br>
For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.<br>
<br>
Romans 15:4 (NLT)<br>
Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God's promises to be fulfilled.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 5:7 (KJV)<br>
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.<br>
<br>
James 5:7 (NLT)<br>
Dear brothers and sisters, be patient as you wait for the Lord's return. Consider the farmers who patiently wait for the rains in the fall and in the spring. They eagerly look for the valuable harvest to ripen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 14:12 (KJV)<br>
Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.<br>
<br>
Revelation 14:12 (NLT)<br>
This means that God's holy people must endure persecution patiently, obeying his commands and maintaining their faith in Jesus.<br>
<br>
(Revelation) 14:12 (TS2009)<br>
Here is the endurance of the set-apart ones, here are those guarding the commands of ELL-Low-Heem and the belief of Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>

Jeremiah 10: 1-3 -- KJV<br>
10:1 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:<br>
10:2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.<br>
10:3 For the customs of the people are vain....<br>
(For the statutes of the people are vanity....)<br>
(For the ordinances of the people are vanity....)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10: 1-3 -- NLT<br>
1<br>
Hear the word that the Lord speaks to you, O Israel!<br>
2<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Do not act like the other nations,<br>
who try to read their future in the stars.<br>
Do not be afraid of their predictions,<br>
even though other nations are terrified by them.<br>
3<br>
Their ways are futile and foolish....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10: 1-3 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
1 Hear the word which Yaw-Who-Wah speaks to you, O house of (Israel) Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL).<br>
2 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, "Do not learn the way of the nations, and do not be awed by the signs of the heavens, for the nations are awed by them.<br>
3 "For the laws of these peoples are worthless....<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10:8 -- KJV<br>
(But they are in one brutish and foolish)<br>
(But they are at once brutish and foolish)<br>
10:8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10:8 (NLT)<br>
People who worship idols are stupid and foolish. The things they worship are made of wood!<br>
<br>
<br>
(Jeremiah) 10:8 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
They are both brutish and foolish, an instruction of worthlessness is the tree.<br>
<br>
Wood? Tree?  What tree?  The Christmas Tree?<br>
What is being described here in Jeremiah 10?<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10: 1-8 -- TS2009<br>
1 Hear the word which Yaw-Who-Wah speaks to you, O house of (Israel) Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL).<br>
2 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, "Do not learn the way of the nations, and do not be awed by the signs of the heavens, for the nations are awed by them.<br>
3 "For the laws of these peoples are worthless, for one cuts a tree from the forest, work for the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool.<br>
4 "They beautify it with silver and gold, they strengthen it with nails and hammers so that it does not topple.<br>
5 "They are like a rounded post, and they do not speak. They have to be carried, because they do not walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they do no evil, nor is it in them to do any good."<br>
6 There is none like You, O Yaw-Who-Wah. You are great, and great is Your Name in might.<br>
7 Who would not fear You, O Sovereign of the nations? For this is Your due, for amongst all the wise men of the nations, and in all their reigns, there is none like You.<br>
8 They are both brutish and foolish, an instruction of worthlessness is the tree.<br>
<br>
Commentary: an instruction of worthlessness is the Christmas tree.<br>
These people that worship this, they don't have it in them to do any good.<br>
That is what we see right there in verse 5.<br>
I do not want to ever be described as a person that does not have it in me to do any good.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Thinking about what we saw there, earlier in Exodus 32, verses 4 and 5:<br>
They made a gold object of worship, then they stamped the Lord's name onto it.<br>
Then they planned to have a feast in the name of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
They were not commanded by Yaw-Who-Wah to do that.<br>
They made it up and stamped Yaw-Who-Wah's name on it.<br>
Verse 28 says that, as a result, three thousand people were killed because of that, and<br>
in verse 35, it says that the Lord sent a great plague upon the people because they had worshiped the calf Aaron had made.<br>
Death, killing and a plague, all from inventing a man-made holiday, a man-made graven image, man-made objects and man-made symbols, and then claiming to redeem it by attaching Yaw-Who-Wah's name on the man-made object.<br>
<br>
They had worshiped the calf Aaron had made, and we worship Christmas and many other holidays like it.<br>
The result of doing that was death, killing and a plague.<br>
Do we have a plague in our land right now, with masks and needle pricks?<br>
When are most suicides?  Around Christmas time?  When do people get depressed the most?  Around Christmas time?<br>
<br>
Recall the many Bible studies that we have done here, and we will remember the solution to all of this.<br>
Here's the solution. Have you done all of these steps?<br>
All of you who are on the Lord's side, come here and join me.<br>
Who is on Yaw-Who-Wah's side? let him come unto me.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Step 1. Get Saved -- Believe in the Beloved Son and make Him your Master -- receive His mercy, grace and forgiveness.<br>
Is He your Master?  Are you His servant? Do you think of Him in that kind of way?<br>
<br>
Step 2. Let Him In and Live For Him -- let Him enter into you, like the bread, like the wine or water or grape juice.<br>
Live your life for Him, and not for your own self.<br>
You can't receive the nutritional benefits if you don't let Him enter into you and become one with you.<br>
If you have done that, then that is why He commanded us to do communion, so that we remember that.<br>
He commanded us to do this in remembrance of Him and what He finished on the Cross for us.<br>
<br>
Step 3. His Holy Spirit Living in You fully causes you to obey His commandments fully and completely.<br>
When you have accomplished this step, you will desire and delight to obey all of His commandments, His law, His Torah.<br>
Ask Him to enter in and fill you with His spirit that is Holy and set-apart.<br>
<br>
Step 4. Study the Bible, Obey the Bible and Pray every day.<br>
You can't do this Step 4 right here, if you have not done Steps 1, 2 and 3 first.<br>
<br>
Step 5. Obey The Ten Commandments, and The two greatest commandments, Love God, Love Others, Forgive Others.<br>
If you do not forgive others, then you will not be forgiven, and forgiveness is what we need to live forever in Heaven.<br>
Make His glory and the kingdom of Heaven more important than your own personal interests.<br>
Make the interests of others more important than your own personal interests.<br>
Look for ways to love others, pray for others, help others, with prayer, pray for them, give them your time, your money.<br>
Sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven.<br>
Love those who are in need, love those broken down, love the least of these,<br>
Love those who are damaged and injured and can't show the love and return the love back to you.<br>
Love your enemies and look for ways to help them and bless them.<br>
You love them, with the expectation that they may not be able to love you back.<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 33 and 34 -- NLT<br>
33 "Sell your possessions and give to those in need. This will store up treasure for you in heaven! And the purses of heaven never get old or develop holes. Your treasure will be safe; no thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it.<br>
34 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Step 6. Do the commandments, Do the seven feasts, Holy Days (think of them as Bible, Torah Holidays) and do the days of rest as commanded in the Bible.<br>
Do not work or buy or sell on Sabbath days of rest. Make every Saturday a Sabbath day.<br>
Do the holidays that He commands us to do, which are the Seven Feasts.<br>
Love Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and show Him that love in doing the seven feasts and days of rest.<br>
Try your best to figure out when to do them, and it is your heart and attitude of wanting to do them completely well and right that matters most.<br>
Getting the day wrong, but doing it right, even on the wrong day, is better than refusing to do it.  It is an issue of the heart, not of technical precision.<br>
Keep studying and learning more about it and He will show you how to do it even better next time you do it, and that learning includes improving the precision on how to calculate when to do each feast.<br>
<br>
Step 7. Stop inventing and doing customs, rituals and holidays that are not commanded in the Bible.<br>
Passover? Yes!  Seder (Say-Dur) feast?  Not in the Bible, so don't do it!<br>
Don't let the worldly popularity of a holiday or tradition be the indicator of whether or not you should participate.<br>
<br>
If you are not commanded in the Bible to do that special day, then don't do it!<br>
<br>
Let's finish this study now with a quick prayer.<br>
<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, Dear ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
In the past, I have, and many of us have done holidays and traditions that are not in the Bible.<br>
The Lord Yaw-Who-Wah never commanded us to do those.<br>
In fact, He commands us not to do them.<br>
We did those in the past, and we worshipped the food, the objects and symbols associated with them.<br>
Putting ash on our forehead, wearing costumes, valentine heart shapes, four-leaf clovers,<br>
wine glasses and drinking parties, fireworks, candy and pumpkins, fairy lights on trees,<br>
eggs and bunnies, hot cross buns, wearing crowns made out of paper,<br>
wearing little round hats on our heads, having to put a cloth over our head when we pray,<br>
parties for special sports on TV and watching certain movies on certain days every year,<br>
we have worshipped days and objects and symbols associated with those days.<br>
So, we confess that we need your grace, mercy and forgiveness.<br>
Forgive us ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, and help us do the feasts and Sabbaths that you do command us to do,<br>
and help us not participate in the days, holidays and feasts that you want us to have nothing more to do with.<br>
Help us forget about them, and ignore and stay away from participating in the worshipping of these days and objects that were not commanded by you.<br>
Instead, help us do those seven steps that we were just thinking about.<br>
We thankfully receive your forgiveness. In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, in Jesus' name, Amen, Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
