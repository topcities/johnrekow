The book of Ecclesiastes, chapters 9 and 10, have kind of a weird bit of scripture to read.<br>
It's from King Solomon just kind of writing down some odd Thoughts on Wisdom and Folly,<br>
pondering on some of The Ironies of Life.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 9:13 continuing to Ecclesiastes 10:7 KJV<br>
13 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:<br>
14 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:<br>
15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.<br>
16 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.<br>
17 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.<br>
18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.<br>
<br>
(Flies of death cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour,)<br>
1 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.<br>
<br>
2 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.<br>
<br>
(Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his heart faileth him,)<br>
3 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.<br>
<br>
<br>
4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.<br>
<br>
(There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from before.)<br>
(There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from before the ruler.)<br>
5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:<br>
<br>
(Folly is set in great heights, and the rich sit in low place.)<br>
6 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.<br>
<br>
7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 9:13 continuing to Ecclesiastes 10:7 NLT<br>
<br>
13 Here is another bit of wisdom that has impressed me as I have watched the way our world works.<br>
14 There was a small town with only a few people, and a great king came with his army and besieged it.<br>
15 A poor, wise man knew how to save the town, and so it was rescued. But afterwards no one thought to thank him.<br>
16 So even though wisdom is better than strength, those who are wise will be despised if they are poor. What they say will not be appreciated for long.<br>
17<br>
Better to hear the quiet words of a wise person<br>
than the shouts of a foolish king.<br>
18<br>
Better to have wisdom than weapons of war,<br>
but one sinner can destroy much that is good.<br>
1<br>
As dead flies cause even a bottle of perfume to stink,<br>
so a little foolishness spoils great wisdom and honour.<br>
2<br>
A wise person chooses the right road;<br>
a fool takes the wrong one.<br>
3<br>
You can identify fools<br>
just by the way they walk down the street!<br>
4<br>
If your boss is angry at you, don't quit!<br>
A quiet spirit can overcome even great mistakes.<br>
5<br>
There is another evil I have seen under the sun. Kings and rulers make a grave mistake<br>
6<br>
when they give great authority to foolish people and low positions to people of proven worth.<br>
7<br>
I have even seen servants riding horseback like princes -- and princes walking like servants!<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 21:26 (KJV)<br>
Thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In Luke 1, The Birth of Jesus is Foretold to Mary.<br>
Then, after Mary Visits Elizabeth, Mary sings a Song of Praise.<br>
In that Song of Praise, is this verse...<br>
Luke 1:52 (KJV)<br>
He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 2:11 (KJV)<br>
The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 2:12 (KJV)<br>
For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 2:17 (KJV)<br>
And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3:31-34 KJV<br>
(Envy thou not a man of violence, and choose none of his ways.)<br>
31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.<br>
32 For the froward is abomination to the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous.<br>
33 The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.<br>
34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3: 31-34 NLT<br>
31<br>
Don't envy violent people<br>
or copy their ways.<br>
32<br>
Such wicked people are detestable to the Lord,<br>
but he offers his friendship to the godly.<br>
33<br>
The Lord curses the house of the wicked,<br>
but he blesses the home of the upright.<br>
34<br>
The Lord mocks the mockers<br>
but is gracious to the humble.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3:34 NLT, Greek Version<br>
The Lord opposes the proud<br>
but gives grace to the humble.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3:34, The Greek Version, is also quoted in<br>
James 4:6 and  1 Peter 5:5<br>
Let's look at those verses next...<br>
<br>
<br>
James 4:6 (KJV)<br>
But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5:5 (KJV)<br>
Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.<br>
<br>
If you read them again, and keep reading just a little bit after that,<br>
It's even more delightfully delicious, and spiritually nutritious...<br>
<br>
James 4: 6-8 KJV<br>
6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.<br>
7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5:5-8 (KJV)<br>
5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.<br>
6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:<br>
7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.<br>
8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:19 (KJV)<br>
Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.<br>
<br>
Matthew 23:12 (KJV)<br>
And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 138:6 (KJV)<br>
Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 138: 6-8 (KJV)<br>
6 Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.<br>
7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.<br>
8 The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 138: 6-8 (NLT)<br>
6<br>
Though the Lord is great, he cares for the humble,<br>
but he keeps his distance from the proud.<br>
7<br>
Though I am surrounded by troubles,<br>
you will protect me from the anger of my enemies.<br>
You reach out your hand,<br>
and the power of your right hand saves me.<br>
8<br>
The Lord will work out his plans for my life --<br>
for your faithful love, O Lord, endures forever.<br>
Don't abandon me, for you made me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 13:11 (KJV)<br>
And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 13:11 (NLT)<br>
"I, the Lord, will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their sin. I will crush the arrogance of the proud and humble the pride of the mighty.<br>

<br>
Luke 1:31 (KJV)<br>
And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 1:21 (KJV)<br>
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 1:31 and Matthew 1:21 both use the same Greek word for<br>
Jesus.<br>
The Greek word in both of those verses is pronounced,<br>
Yee-Suh-Seeg-Mah<br>
It is the Greek form of Joshua<br>
Jesus means, Jaw-Who-Wah is Salvation<br>
<br>
It is also similar to the Greek word, Vah-Duh-Seeg-Mah,<br>
which was the Greek name for Jesus Barabbas, which was<br>
the captive robber whom the Jews begged Pilate <br>
to release instead of Christ.<br>
<br>
John 18:40 (KJV)
Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.<br>
<br>
The Greek word for Barabbas, was Vah-Duh-Seeg-Mah,<br>
it means, son of Abba<br>
Barabbas, means, "son of a father or master".<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  The religious leaders, the leaders of religious law, have been trying to push us away from the truth and the power of our Heavenly Father and our Messiah, Saviour and Deliverer.  In the Old Testament, we started with the true name of our Heavenly Father, Yaw-Who-Wah, then they make up a lie and say that His name is too holy to be said out loud, so they remove the vowels and write Y H W H, and people start saying what might be slightly inaccurate variations of his name, like, Yaw-Way, then YHWH gets replaced in English with, The Lord.  The Hebrew word for, Lord, is pronounced, Bail, which is the name of a fake god of idolatry. We start with the correct name, then we have a slightly inaccurate name, then it gets substituted with a completely different name that references something that is actually evil.<br>
<br>
The same thing happens again in the New Testament, all credit again going to the religious leaders of religious law.  We start with our saviour and Messiah, whose name in Hebrew is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw. In English, it is pronounced, Joshua.  Then in Greek, Joshua is pronounced, in Greek as, Yee-Suh-Seeg-Mah. Then the religious leaders manage to take the people and substitute Yee-Suh-Seeg-Mah with another Greek name that sounds very similar, Vah-Duh-Seeg-Mah, which also has a similar meaning in the Greek, but when Vah-Duh-Seeg-Mah gets translated into English, we get Barabbas, which was an evil robber. We start with the correct name, then we have a slightly inaccurate name, then it eventually gets substituted with a completely different name that references someone that is actually evil. The real one and the fake, evil one switch places. Jesus is innocent and knew no sin, and receives persecution and punishment, and the evil robber, Barabbas, is given freedom.  Just like the evil sinner, and the Messiah, trade places, and Jesus receives the punishment of death for our sins, though he did not do anything wrong, and we, the sinner, are given freedom from death and hell and get to have forgiveness and eternal life in Heaven.<br>
<br>
It was the religious leaders who are trying to take away the power of calling upon his name, by causing us to forget what his name actually is. The Catholics admit that they changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, and the Bible never did such a thing, and yet, how many Christians call Sunday the day of rest and do church services on Sunday?  There is power in doing what the Bible says, and the Catholics are trying to push you away from this power by making you do the Sabbath on the wrong day, so that you disobey the Bible even more.  Then, in 1978, the NIV translators insert a completely fictional lie into their NIV translation, making it sound like Jesus ate unclean pig meat, and that it's OK to eat unclean animals.  It's an absolute lie from satan, not in the original New Testament, and yet copied into the NLT and other newer English translations. We already have done a Bible study on that, and where the lie was located, so we will not get into that again. We will also not talk again about the Hebrew word, Ah-Main being pronounced slightly wrong as, Ah-men, or Ay-men, and what that mispronunciation kind of sounds like in the Greek language.  In summary, we need to keep studying the Bible carefully, digging deep into it, going back to the ancient texts and original Hebrew and Greek word studies, because religions and religious people have been trying to slowly push us away from the true and perfect Bible, by slowly changing names and inserting lies and inaccuracies to gradually decrease its precision and quality, thereby attempting to decrease the quality of your relationship with Yaw.<br>
<br>
Dear Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, Dear Lord Jesus, please help us study your word, your scriptures, your Torah, your Bible, and help us graduate above and beyond the deliberate concealments, omissions and lies that Christian churches have been delivering and programming us with, and please de-programme and re-programme us with truth and wisdom from above, from you. Help us unbury the truth and help us follow, study, do and obey the entire Bible, from cover to cover, all of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament, and deliver into us the truth that may have been removed from our Bibles, that were in the additional books that we no longer have in our Bibles.  Guide us into all truth and help us obey it and do it, in Jesus' name, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main, Amen.<br>

In Matthew 7, and in Luke 13, was Jesus quoting from Psalms 6:8?  It sure sounds like it.<br>
Let's take a look...<br>
<br>
Psalms 6:8 (KJV)<br>
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7:23 (KJV)<br>
And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 13:27 (KJV)<br>
But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.<br>
<br>
We will dive into those two stories here, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 13 & 14 (KJV)<br>
13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:<br>
14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 13-17 NLT<br>
13 "You can enter God's Kingdom only through the narrow gate.<br>
(The road that leads to destruction is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.)<br>
The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.<br>
14 But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.<br>
15 "Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves.<br>
16 You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way they act. Can you pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?<br>
17 A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 17-29 KJV<br>
17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.<br>
18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.<br>
19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<br>
20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.<br>
21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.<br>
22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?<br>
23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.<br>
24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:<br>
25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.<br>
26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:<br>
27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.<br>
28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:<br>
29 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 17-29 NLT<br>
17 A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit.<br>
18 A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.<br>
19 So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.<br>
20 Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify people by their actions.<br>
21 "Not everyone who calls out to me, 'Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.<br>
22 On judgement day many will say to me, 'Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.'<br>
23 But I will reply, 'I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God's laws.'<br>
24 "Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock.<br>
25 Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse because it is built on bedrock.<br>
26 But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn't obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand.<br>
27 When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash."<br>
28 When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,<br>
29 for he taught with real authority -- quite unlike their teachers of religious law.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 13: 23-30 KJV<br>
23 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,<br>
24 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.<br>
25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:<br>
26 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.<br>
27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.<br>
28 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.<br>
29 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.<br>
30 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 13 22-30 NLT<br>
22 Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he went, always pressing on toward Jerusalem.<br>
23 Someone asked him, "Lord, will only a few be saved?"<br>
He replied,<br>
24 "Work hard to enter the narrow door to God's Kingdom, for many will try to enter but will fail.<br>
25 When the master of the house has locked the door, it will be too late. You will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Lord, open the door for us!' But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'<br>
26 Then you will say, 'But we ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'<br>
27 And he will reply, 'I tell you, I don't know you or where you come from. Get away from me, all you who do evil.'<br>
28 "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, for you will see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, but you will be thrown out.<br>
29 And people will come from all over the world -- from east and west, north and south -- to take their places in the Kingdom of God.<br>
30 And note this: Some who seem least important now will be the greatest then, and some who are the greatest now will be least important then."<br>
(And note this: Some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.)<br>
<br>
Matthew 7, verses 21 and 22, and,<br>
Luke 13, verse 25, in the KJV, these three verses all say,<br>
Lord, Lord.<br>
All three of these verses, where they say, Lord, Lord<br>
The Greek word being used there, is pronounced, Key-Dee-Ohs<br>
Today, this Greek word is used today as a respectful way of saying, Mister.<br>
It means, a lord, a master, having power, supreme in authority,<br>
who has control and has power of deciding.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  The workers of iniquity, those who do evil, thought they were going to go to heaven when they recognised His face, but they never had any real relationship with him.  I might recognise the face of a famous celebrity person, but that famous person does not even know I exist because I do not have any actual relationship with him or her. Same concept.  The famous celebrity person will not just let some stranger like myself just walk right into their mansion, and if I have zero relationship with Jesus, why would he let a stranger just walk right into his kingdom? "I'm sorry, I don't know you, you're going to have to leave," is what the famous person says to me over the intercom at the driveway gate, and so does Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, to those he does not know that show up at his gate going into his kingdom. They don't even know his name.  When they said, "Lord, Lord" they were saying a wrong Greek name there that, today, is the equivalent of saying, Hey, Mister.  Hey, Mister, is what you say to a gentleman that you do not know, and you don't know what his name is, because you've never really had any kind of relationship with that other stranger, prior to that first encounter. It was obvious they did not know Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, because they did not really even know what his name was.  Do you? You can have a real relationship with your Messiah and Saviour, even if you're not quite sure how to perfectly pronounce his name.<br>

Philippians 3:17 to 4:1  (KJV)<br>
17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example.<br>
18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:<br>
19 Whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)<br>
20 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:<br>
21 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.<br>
1 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.<br>

Philippians 3:17 to 4:1 NLT<br>
17 Dear brothers and sisters, pattern your lives after mine, and learn from those who follow our example.<br>
18 For I have told you often before, and I say it again with tears in my eyes, that there are many whose conduct shows they are really enemies of the cross of Christ.<br>
19 They are headed for destruction. Their god is their appetite, they brag about shameful things, and they think only about this life here on earth.<br>
20 But we are citizens of heaven, where the Lord Jesus Christ lives. And we are eagerly waiting for him to return as our Saviour.<br>
21 He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies like his own, using the same power with which he will bring everything under his control.<br>
1 Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stay true to the Lord. I love you and long to see you, dear friends, for you are my joy and the crown I receive for my work.<br>

216,000 Genes<br>
<br>
This is a Bible study titled,<br>
Two hundred and sixteen thousand genes.<br>
We will learn more about that later on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you see anything happening today in culture, in society and in the news that might be a big, strong deception, a strong delusion, that will cause them to be greatly deceived, and they will believe these lies?<br>
Here is a look again at some verses that we looked at before, at the end of<br>
the Christian Page, unofficially referred to as the chapter 1 Bonus Verses.<br>
It is related to what we will be reading here next, so once again...<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 2:11 (KJV)<br>
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:<br>
<br>
Isaiah 66:4 (KJV)<br>
I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 2: 3-14 KJV<br>
3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;<br>
4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.<br>
5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?<br>
6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.<br>
7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.<br>
8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:<br>
9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,<br>
10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.<br>
11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:<br>
12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.<br>
13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:<br>
14 Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 2: 3-14 NLT<br>
<br>
(Don't be fooled by what they say. For that day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of sin is revealed -- the son of destruction).<br>
<br>
3 Don't be fooled by what they say. For that day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of lawlessness is revealed -- the one who brings destruction.<br>
4 He will exalt himself and defy everything that people call god and every object of worship. He will even sit in the temple of God, claiming that he himself is God.<br>
5 Don't you remember that I told you about all this when I was with you?<br>
6 And you know what is holding him back, for he can be revealed only when his time comes.<br>
7 For this lawlessness is already at work secretly, and it will remain secret until the one who is holding it back steps out of the way.<br>
8 Then the man of lawlessness will be revealed, but the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth and destroy him by the splendour of his coming.<br>
9 This man will come to do the work of Satan with counterfeit power and signs and miracles.<br>
10 He will use every kind of evil deception to fool those on their way to destruction, because they refuse to love and accept the truth that would save them.<br>
11 So God will cause them to be greatly deceived, and they will believe these lies.<br>
12 Then they will be condemned for enjoying evil rather than believing the truth.<br>
13 As for us, we can't help but thank God for you, dear brothers and sisters loved by the Lord. We are always thankful (that God chose you from the very beginning to experience salvation, and) that God chose you to be among the first to experience salvation -- a salvation that came through the Spirit who makes you holy and through your belief in the truth.<br>
14 He called you to salvation when we told you the Good News; now you can share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 66: 3-5 KJV<br>
...Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.<br>
4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.<br>
5 Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 66: 2-8 NLT<br>
<br>
(My hands have made both heaven and earth;<br>
these things are mine.)<br>
2<br>
My hands have made both heaven and earth;<br>
they and everything in them are mine.<br>
I, the Lord, have spoken!<br>
"I will bless those who have humble and contrite hearts,<br>
who tremble at my word.<br>
3<br>
But those who choose their own ways --<br>
delighting in their detestable sins --<br>
will not have their offerings accepted.<br>
When such people sacrifice a bull,<br>
it is no more acceptable than a human sacrifice.<br>
When they sacrifice a lamb,<br>
it's as though they had sacrificed a dog!<br>
When they bring an offering of grain,<br>
they might as well offer the blood of a pig.<br>
When they burn frankincense,<br>
it's as if they had blessed an idol.<br>
4<br>
I will send them great trouble --<br>
all the things they feared.<br>
For when I called, they did not answer.<br>
When I spoke, they did not listen.<br>
They deliberately sinned before my very eyes<br>
and chose to do what they know I despise."<br>
5<br>
Hear this message from the Lord,<br>
all you who tremble at his words:<br>
"Your own people hate you<br>
and throw you out for being loyal to my name.<br>
'Let the Lord be honoured!' they scoff.<br>
'Be joyful in him!'<br>
But they will be put to shame.<br>
6<br>
What is all the commotion in the city?<br>
What is that terrible noise from the Temple?<br>
It is the voice of the Lord<br>
taking vengeance against his enemies.<br>
7<br>
"Before the birth pains even begin,<br>
Jerusalem gives birth to a son.<br>
8<br>
Who has ever seen anything as strange as this?<br>
Who ever heard of such a thing?<br>
Has a nation ever been born in a single day?<br>
Has a country ever come forth in a mere moment?<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Another prophecy here has come true,<br>
Jerusalem, Zion, the nation of Israel was born in a single day<br>
when its Independence was declared on 14 May 1948.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When we did the Bible study called, Revelation Summary,<br>
back in Christian Essays 2, we looked at<br>
<br>
Daniel 9:27 (KJV)<br>
And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.<br>
<br>
Daniel 9:27 (NLT)<br>
The ruler will make a treaty with the people for a period of one set of seven, but after half this time, he will put an end to the sacrifices and offerings. And as a climax to all his terrible deeds, he will set up a sacrilegious object that causes desecration, until the fate decreed for this defiler is finally poured out on him."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The ruler will make a treaty with the people.<br>
The ruler of the United States announced, on 13 August 2020,<br>
that he was making a treaty with the Arabs and Israel.<br>
When the treaty got signed on Tuesday 15 September 2020, was this a fulfilment<br>
of Daniel 9:27?<br>
Is the ruler of the United States the anti-Christ?<br>
Does this Daniel 9:27 event identify who the anti-Christ is, and does this signal the start the seven-year Tribulation on Tuesday 15 September 2020?<br>

After Revelation 12, which talks about<br>
The Woman and the Dragon<br>
<br>
Revelation 13 talks about two beasts,<br>
The Beast out of the Sea, and<br>
The Beast out of the Earth<br>
<br>
Revelation 13 -- all of Revelation 13, all 18 verses<br>
KJV<br>
1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.<br>
2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.<br>
3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.<br>
4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?<br>
5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.<br>
6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.<br>
7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.<br>
8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.<br>
9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.<br>
10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.<br>
11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.<br>
12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.<br>
13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,<br>
14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.<br>
15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.<br>
16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:<br>
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.<br>
18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 13 -- all of Revelation 13, all 18 verses<br>
NLT<br>
1 Then I saw a beast rising up out of the sea. It had seven heads and ten horns, with ten crowns on its horns. And written on each head were names that blasphemed God.<br>
2 This beast looked like a leopard, but it had the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion! And the dragon gave the beast his own power and throne and great authority.<br>
3 I saw that one of the heads of the beast seemed wounded beyond recovery -- but the fatal wound was healed! The whole world marvelled at this miracle and gave allegiance to the beast.<br>
4 They worshipped the dragon for giving the beast such power, and they also worshipped the beast. "Who is as great as the beast?" they exclaimed. "Who is able to fight against him?"<br>
5 Then the beast was allowed to speak great blasphemies against God. And he was given authority to do whatever he wanted for forty-two months.<br>
<br>
(And he spoke terrible words of blasphemy against God, slandering his name and his dwelling and all who dwell in heaven.)<br>
6 And he spoke terrible words of blasphemy against God, slandering his name and his dwelling -- that is, those who dwell in heaven.<br>
<br>
7 And the beast was allowed to wage war against God's holy people and to conquer them. And he was given authority to rule over every tribe and people and language and nation.<br>
<br>
(And all the people who belong to this world worshipped the beast. They are the ones whose names were not written in the Book of Life before the world was made -- the Book that belongs to the Lamb who was slaughtered.)<br>
8 And all the people who belong to this world worshipped the beast. They are the ones whose names were not written in the Book of Life that belongs to the Lamb who was slaughtered before the world was made.<br>
<br>
<br>
9<br>
Anyone with ears to hear<br>
should listen and understand.<br>
10<br>
Anyone who is destined for prison<br>
will be taken to prison.<br>
Anyone destined to die by the sword<br>
will die by the sword.<br>
This means that God's holy people must endure persecution patiently and remain faithful.<br>
<br>
11 Then I saw another beast come up out of the earth. He had two horns like those of a lamb, but he spoke with the voice of a dragon.<br>
12 He exercised all the authority of the first beast. And he required all the earth and its people to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.<br>
13 He did astounding miracles, even making fire flash down to earth from the sky whilst everyone was watching.<br>
14 And with all the miracles he was allowed to perform on behalf of the first beast, he deceived all the people who belong to this world. He ordered the people to make a great statue of the first beast, who was fatally wounded and then came back to life.<br>
15 He was then permitted to give life to this statue so that it could speak. Then the statue of the beast commanded that anyone refusing to worship it must die.<br>
16 He required everyone -- small and great, rich and poor, free and slave -- to be given a mark on the right hand or on the forehead.<br>
17 And no one could buy or sell anything without that mark, which was either the name of the beast or the number representing his name.<br>
<br>
(Wisdom is needed here. Let the one with understanding solve the meaning of the number of the beast, for it is the number of humanity. His number is 616.)<br>
18 Wisdom is needed here. Let the one with understanding solve the meaning of the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is 666.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Looking at that last verse, Revelation 13:18.<br>
We are looking at that number 666.<br>
The English number, 666 is represented by three Greek characters, placed in this sequence.<br>
<br>
The first Greek character is pronounced, Schee<br>
The second character is pronounced, See<br>
and the third one is, Steeg-Mah<br>
<br>
If you say each one again, you have,<br>
Schee, See, Steeg-Mah<br>
If you put a space between them, you get the pronunciation,<br>
Heek-See.<br>
If you put them together, you get, Hee-cks -- or what sounds like, Seeks, without the s sound.<br>
<br>
<br>
I was asking some online Greek translators<br>
to pronounce these three Greek characters,<br>
either together as one word,<br>
or as three individual characters,<br>
here are the results...<br>
Heeks<br>
Heek-See Steeg-Mah<br>
Heek-See Steeg-Mah Tawf<br>
HeekSee SEeg Mo kuh Taf<br>
HeekSee<br>
Heeks<br>
Hee Ksee<br>
Hee Keye Schee<br>
<br>
<br>
Another, more-accurate way to pronounce it, based on the way how the Ancient Greek language would have used and pronounced these three Greek characters that we translate into,<br>
666, the original Greek for, 666, may sound, more accurately in the Greek, like this,<br>
Hi, Ksci, Steeg-Mah<br>
<br>
The last character, stigma, has a strong E sound, like this... Steeg-Mah.<br>
That middle character, Ksci, is pronounced like Sky, but the s and the kuh sounds switch places.<br>
So, instead of saying, Sky, you would switch the s sound and the Kuh sound, and you get, Ksci<br>
So, again, it's, Hi, Ksci, Stigma.<br>
In the Greek alphabet, it's the 22nd letter, the 14th letter, and what used to be between the 5th and 6th letters, but is now obsolete.<br>
The characters mean, 600, 60 and 6.<br>
That can mean, six hundred and sixty-six, something that, when computed or calculated, produces and arrives at the number of six hundred and sixty-six.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Of course, the people around at the time, which could very well include the ones who are reading and hearing these words right now, they will understand the six six six reference when the time comes.<br>
The Lord will stream and download the knowledge and wisdom about the six six six into the faithful followers at that time, and that time could be right now.<br>
Just for fun, let's dig a little into that six six six, and see if there's anything more to be had from it.<br>
And then, hang in there, keep digging, and in just a short moment from now, we will reveal the actual solution to what this six six six number really means!<br>
What has baffled millions for two thousand years is about to be solved right now before your very eyes!<br>
Here's a clue -- it's the number 600 and the number 60 and the number 6, and you do something with those three numbers.<br>
Think about what is going on today in the news and in society as you read this.<br>
<br>
Revelation 13:18<br>
Six hundred threescore and six<br>
Here are the shovels that we will use to help us dig...<br>
<br>
We will consult again, and consider what is said in our usual Greek references,<br>
Strong's Greek and Hebrew Dictionary,<br>
Short lemma definitions from Perseus Digital Library,<br>
Public Domain Greek-English lexicon by John Jeffrey Dodson (2010),<br>
Strong's Greek Dictionary provided by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen from Michael Grier's online text,<br>
Thayer's Lexicon prepared by Alan Bunning, provided by the Centre for New Testament Restoration, and the<br>
Tyndale Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Greek (TBESG) - published by Tyndale House, in Cambridge.<br>
<br>
Six hundred threescore and six.<br>
They are three characters of the Greek language.<br>
 the 22nd, 14th and an obsolete letter, of the Greek alphabet.<br>
The obsolete letter looks interesting, as a cross.<br>
The obsolete letter comes from a Greek word that is pronounced, Steeg-Mah<br>
Steeg-Mah<br>
Today, Steeg-Mah is translated into the English word, stigma.<br>
<br>
In September 2020, the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries define the word, stigma, as...<br>
 shame or social disgrace<br>
a blemish or scar on the skin<br>
in a flowering plant, stigma is the sticky surface that receives pollen and which is situated at the tip of the style, which is the part of the carpel, -- the female reproductive part of a flowering plant, -- which is usually elongated, that connects the stigma to the ovary.<br>
stigma can also refer to a variety of pigmented markings or spots, like the wingspot of certain butterflies.<br>
In the Greek language, stigma, means, brand, and can be traced back to another Greek word that means, to mark with a tattoo.<br>
<br>
Continuing our look at the Dictionaries,<br>
stigma is a strong feeling of disapproval that most people in a society have about something, especially when this is unfair.<br>
the top of the central female part of a flower, where pollen is received,<br>
a strong lack of respect for a person or a group of people or a bad opinion of them because they have done something society does not approve of<br>
<br>
stigma is a strong feeling in society that being in a particular situation or having a particular illness is something to be ashamed of<br>
The top of the centre part of a flower that receives the pollen which allows it to form new seeds.<br>
It can be traced back to a Latin word that means, mark, mark burned on the skin, to tattoo.<br>
<br>
If something has a stigma attached to it, people think it is something to be ashamed of.<br>
The stigma of a flower is the top of the centre part which takes in pollen.<br>
<br>
stigma can be negative feelings that people have about particular circumstances or characteristics that somebody may have<br>
the part in the middle of a flower where pollen is received<br>
<br>
<br>
Continuing again with the Greek references, looking some more at, Steeg-Mah<br>
The Greek word Steeg-Mah, from which we get the English word, stigma.<br>
Steeg-Mah is the mark of a pointed instrument, a tattoo-mark, brand<br>
a mark or brand.<br>
a mark incised or punched, for recognition of ownership.<br>
scar of service, to mark, stick, prick.<br>
a tattooed mark or brand<br>
<br>
Steeg-Mah is a mark pricked in or branded upon the body. To ancient oriental usage, slaves and soldiers bore the name or the stamp of their master or commander branded or pricked into their bodies, or cut into their bodies, to indicate what master or general they belonged to, and there were even some devotee's who stamped themselves in this way with the token of their gods.<br>
<br>
Steeg-Mah is the obsolete letter, as a cross of the Greek alphabet (intermediate between the 5th and 6th), used as numbers; denoting respectively 600, 60 and 6<br>
The 22nd letter, the 14th letter, and an obsolete letter that was between 5th and 6th letters of the Greek alphabet.<br>
If we take these three Greek letters and put them together,<br>
the number six six six that we have today in the English Bible comes from these three Greek letters.<br>
If we try to pronounce the three Greek letters together, it sounds like, Hee-cks.<br>
It sounds like we are saying six, but without the s sound at the beginning.<br>
The three Greek letters, put together in this sequence, mean, 666.<br>
six hundred and sixty-six -- the mystical number of the Beast<br>
Three letters of the Greek alphabet, used as numbers; denoting respectively 600, 60 and 6; 666 as a numeral.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Think about this number, and think about Steeg-Mah, and the definition of stigma.<br>
Do you see anything happening today in culture, in society and in the news that might reference this or be related to any of this?<br>
<br>
<br>
The next chapter, Revelation 14, talks about<br>
The Lamb and the 144,000, and<br>
The Three Angels<br>
<br>
Revelation 14: 9-13 KJV<br>
9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,<br>
10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:<br>
11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.<br>
12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.<br>
13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 14: 9-13 NLT<br>
9 Then a third angel followed them, shouting, "Anyone who worships the beast and his statue or who accepts his mark on the forehead or on the hand<br>
10 must drink the wine of God's anger. It has been poured full strength into God's cup of wrath. And they will be tormented with fire and burning sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb.<br>
11 The smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or night, for they have worshipped the beast and his statue and have accepted the mark of his name."<br>
12 This means that God's holy people must endure persecution patiently, obeying his commands and maintaining their faith in Jesus.<br>
13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this down: Blessed are those who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, they are blessed indeed, for they will rest from their hard work; for their good deeds follow them!"<br>
<br>
Commentary: Verse 12, like other places in the Bible, does promise that, the saints, God's holy people, the followers and believers of the Lord Jesus, of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, will have persecution.<br>
We have again this promise of persecution, but verse 12 also tells us how to get through this persecution.<br>
Have patience, endure persecution patiently, keep the commandments of God, keep the law, the Torah, and keep your faith in Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What does that mean, that number 666 and how is it the number of the beast?<br>
Here is a solution! You are about to see the answer to what six six six really means!<br>
<br>
It's actually, 600 and 60 and 6.<br>
Three numbers. The Bible does not say that they are added together.<br>
It's not one number.<br>
It's three numbers, 600, 60 and 6.<br>
Here is a solution, which are basically some notes taken from a presentation found within an August 2022 video by Stephen Pidgeon.<br>
<br>
The 144,000 is not talking about a number of people, it's talking about a number of genes, or genetic instructions.<br>
<br>
There are two helixes that contain the genes, or genetic instructions of pure human DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid), made in the Father's image.<br>
<br>
In pure human DNA, made in God's image, one helix has 72,000 genes, and the other one also has 72,000 genes.<br>
<br>
Add them together: 72,000 plus 72,000 equals 144,000 of pure human DNA, made in the image of the Father.<br>
<br>
Pure virgin, undefiled human DNA has 144,000 genes.<br>
<br>
Add the additional, man-made, modified DNA, that is placed into a human from the Satanic Defilement Injection (SDI) jabby-jab snakebite.<br>
<br>
<br>
The modified DNA attaches to the existing human DNA. It is 72,000 more genes, a third helix that attaches to the existing two.<br>
<br>
144,000 plus 72,000 more, equals 216,000 genes -- the original 144,000 are there originally, with 72,000 more that should not be there.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, instead of walking around with virgin pure 144,000 genes, the snake-bitten one is walking around with 216,000 genes, defiled by the SDI genetic modification.<br>
<br>
Multiply the three Greek characters found in Revelation 13:18.<br>
<br>
"Schee" times  "See"  times "Steeg-Mah" equals 216,000 genes. -- modified human DNA.<br>
<br>
600 times 60 times 6 equals 216,000 genes -- modified human DNA.<br>
<br>
So, it's not six six six, it's not added together, they are three Greek characters multiplied together.<br>
<br>
So, instead of being made in the image of God, ELL-Low-Heem -- 144,000 genes --  one is made into the image of the beast with 216,000 genes.<br>
<br>
The total number of the genes after modification is the number of the beast.<br>
<br>
So, it's solved. the Revelation 13:18 666 mystery is now solved.<br>
<br>
Again, this solution, with the answer being 216,000 Genes, is based on an August 2022 video by Stephen Pidgeon.<br>

Here is something to think about and study.<br>
Let's begin by repeating the last two verses that we just read at the end of the previous study.<br>

Commentary: Here is wisdom, and yet, For in much wisdom is much grief.<br>
Knowing this wisdom can make you sad.<br>
<br>

Ecclesiastes 12: 6-14 (KJV)<br>
12:6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.<br>
12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.<br>
12:8 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.<br>
<br>
(The more wise the preacher was, he still taught the people knowledge;)<br>
12:9 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.<br>
<br>
<br>
12:10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words (of delight): and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.<br>
12:11 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.<br>
<br>
12:12 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study (and much reading) is a weariness of the flesh.<br>
<br>
(The end of the matter, even all that hath been heard, is, Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.)<br>
12:13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.<br>
12:14 For God shall bring every work into judgement, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 12: 6-14 (NLT)<br>
6 Yes, remember your Creator now whilst you are young, before the silver cord of life snaps and the golden bowl is broken. Don't wait until the water jar is smashed at the spring and the pulley is broken at the well.<br>
7 For then the dust will return to the earth, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.<br>
8 "Everything is meaningless," says the Teacher, "completely meaningless."<br>
9 Keep this in mind: The Teacher was considered wise, and he taught the people everything he knew. He listened carefully to many proverbs, studying and classifying them.<br>
10 The Teacher sought to find just the right words to express truths clearly.<br>
11 The words of the wise are like cattle prods -- painful but helpful. Their collected sayings are like a nail-studded stick with which a shepherd drives the sheep.<br>
12 But, my child, let me give you some further advice: Be careful, for writing books is endless, and much study wears you out.<br>
13 That's the whole story. Here now is my final conclusion: Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone's duty.<br>
14 God will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Let us find a careful, daily balance between not studying the Bible enough, and studying the Bible too much.<br>
When we study the Bible enough each day, it is a healthy blessing.<br>
And when we read and study the Bible too much, it can make us weary.<br>
Reading the Bible is like eating honey.<br>
Compare David's positive attitude and Solomon's negative attitude on studying the Bible.<br>

8 The orders of Yaw-Who-Wah are straight, rejoicing the heart; The command of Yaw-Who-Wah is clear, enlightening the eyes;<br>
9 The fear of Yaw-Who-Wah is clean, standing forever; The right-rulings of Yaw-Who-Wah are true, They are righteous altogether,<br>
10 More desirable than gold, Than much fine gold; And sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br>
11 Also, Your servant is warned by them, In guarding them there is great reward.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 19: 9-11 (NLT)<br>
...The laws of the Lord are true;<br>
each one is fair.<br>
10<br>
They are more desirable than gold,<br>
even the finest gold.<br>
They are sweeter than honey,<br>
even honey dripping from the comb.<br>
11<br>
They are a warning to your servant,<br>
a great reward for those who obey them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:103 (NLT)<br>
How sweet your words taste to me; they are sweeter than honey.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 25:27 (NLT)<br>
It's not good to eat too much honey, and it's not good to seek honours for yourself.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 25:16 (NLT)<br>
Do you like honey? Don't eat too much, or it will make you sick!<br>
<br>
Proverbs 25:16 (KJV)<br>
Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Could this mean, if you read very large amounts of Bible at one time, you will not be able to keep it all in you, and retain the knowledge?<br>
Maybe the vomiting out means that you will forget what you read if you read too much at one time?<br>
This is based on the concept that eating honey is being compared to reading the Bible.<br>
Those people that try to read the entire Bible in one year better be careful, as indicated here, or they might get "sick" of reading the Bible if they do too much at one time.<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, I like the more positive attitude of reading the Bible in Psalms 1. Let's go back to Psalms 1 again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 1: 1-3 (KJV)<br>
(Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked,)<br>
1:1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.<br>
1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.<br>
1:3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season;<br>
(his leaf also shall not fade;)<br>
his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 1: 1-6 -- All 6 verses of Psalms 1 (NLT)<br>
Book One (Psalms 1-41)<br>
1<br>
Oh, the joys of those who do not<br>
follow the advice of the wicked,<br>
or stand around with sinners,<br>
or join in with mockers.<br>
2<br>
But they delight in the law of the Lord,<br>
meditating on it day and night.<br>
3<br>
They are like trees planted along the riverbank,<br>
bearing fruit each season.<br>
Their leaves never wither,<br>
and they prosper in all they do.<br>
4<br>
But not the wicked!<br>
They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind.<br>
5<br>
They will be condemned at the time of judgement.<br>
Sinners will have no place amongst the godly.<br>
6<br>
For the Lord watches over the path of the godly,<br>
but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 1: 1-6 -- All 6 verses of Psalms 1 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
1 Blessed is the man who shall not walk in the counsel of the wrong, And shall not stand in the path of sinners, And shall not sit in the seat of scoffers,<br>
2 But his delight is in the Torah of Yaw-Who-Wah, And he meditates in His Torah day and night.<br>
3 For he shall be as a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That yields its fruit in its season, And whose leaf does not wither, And whatever he does prospers.<br>
4 The wrong are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind blows away.<br>
5 Therefore the wrong shall not rise in the judgement, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br>
6 For Yaw-Who-Wah knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wrong comes to naught.<br>

<br>
Revelation 9:6 (KJV)<br>
And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.<br>
<br>
Revelation 9:6 (NLT)<br>
In those days people will seek death but will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 9:6 reminded me of something we have studied way back in Christian Essays 2.<br>
<br>
What we said in that study was this...<br>
<br>
Matthew 25:46 (KJV)<br>
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.<br>
<br>
Matthew 25:46 (NLT)<br>
"And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life."<br>
<br>
What we looked at in that study was, in verse 46, the last verse of chapter 25,<br>
Where it says, everlasting, the original Greek word there is pronounced, eye-oh-knee-ahs<br>
Where it says, eternal, the original Greek word there is pronounced, eye-oh-knee-ahs<br>
<br>
If we insert that into the English verse, it would read,<br>
And these shall go away into eye-oh-knee-ahs punishment: but the righteous into life eye-oh-knee-ahs.<br>
<br>
The same Greek word is used in both places, when describing how long one stays in Hell and how long one stays in Heaven.<br>
<br>
Whether a person goes to hell or heaven, whatever your eternal destination shall be, the length of time you stay there shall be, eye-oh-knee-ahs.<br>
<br>
eye-oh-knee-ahs, means, perpetual, eternal, for ever, everlasting<br>
<br>
perpetual means, continuing all the time without changing or stopping, permanent, everlasting, eternal, continuous<br>
<br>
The Bible does not say that, in hell, there will ever be any rest or sleep, or taking a break, or death.<br>
Being in hell forever is the so-called death forever, being awake and aware of extreme pain and fire burning you forever.<br>
<br>
Those there in hell would wish for death, as in, fall asleep and never wake up again, but that does not happen, forever.<br>
It reminds me of Revelation 9:6.<br>
Could Revelation 9:6 also be describing what a person thinks and feels when they are in hell forever?<br>
<br>
Revelation 9:6 (KJV)<br>
And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.<br>
<br>
Revelation 9:6 (NLT)<br>
In those days people will seek death but will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them!<br>
<br>
Although that may be an interesting thought, we are pulling that verse out of context.<br>
Here is a quick look at what was going on, there in Revelation 9.<br>
We will just look at this in the NLT.<br>
Revelation 9 talks about how The Fifth Trumpet Brings the First Terror.<br>
<br>
Revelation 9: 1-12 -- NLT<br>
1 Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.<br>
(the bottomless pit is also known as, the abyss, or the underworld.)<br>
<br>
2 When he opened it, smoke poured out as though from a huge furnace, and the sunlight and air turned dark from the smoke.<br>
3 Then locusts came from the smoke and descended on the earth, and they were given power to sting like scorpions.<br>
4 They were told not to harm the grass or plants or trees, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.<br>
5 They were told not to kill them but to torture them for five months with pain like the pain of a scorpion sting.<br>
6 In those days people will seek death but will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them!<br>
7 The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. They had what looked like gold crowns on their heads, and their faces looked like human faces.<br>
8 They had hair like women's hair and teeth like the teeth of a lion.<br>
9 They wore armour made of iron, and their wings roared like an army of chariots rushing into battle.<br>
10 They had tails that stung like scorpions, and for five months they had the power to torment people.<br>
11 Their king is the angel from the bottomless pit (the abyss, the underworld); his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon -- the Destroyer.<br>
12 The first terror is past, but look, two more terrors are coming!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 24:13 (KJV)<br>
But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.<br>
<br>
Mark 13:13 (KJV)<br>
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:112 (KJV)<br>
I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:112 (NLT)<br>
I am determined to keep your decrees to the very end.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 6:11 (KJV)<br>
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:<br>
<br>
Hebrews 6:11 (NLT)<br>
Our great desire is that you will keep on loving others as long as life lasts, in order to make certain that what you hope for will come true.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12:2 (NLT)<br>
We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus, the champion who initiates and perfects our faith. Because of the joy awaiting him, he endured the cross, disregarding its shame. Now he is seated in the place of honour beside God’s throne.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:16 (NLT)<br>
So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.<br>
<br>
James 5:11 (KJV)<br>
Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.<br>
<br>
James 5:11 (NLT)<br>
We give great honour to those who endure under suffering. For instance, you know about Job, a man of great endurance. You can see how the Lord was kind to him at the end, for the Lord is full of tenderness and mercy.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 46:4 (NLT)<br>
I will be your God throughout your lifetime --  until your hair is white with age. I made you, and I will care for you. I will carry you along and save you.<br>

1 Corinthians 6: 18-20 KJV<br>
18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.<br>
19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?<br>
20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 6: 18-20 NLT<br>
18 Run from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body.<br>
19 Don't you realise that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself,<br>
20 for God bought you with a high price. So you must honour God with your body.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 7: 1-7 (KJV)<br>
1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.<br>
2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.<br>
3 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.<br>
4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.<br>
5 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.<br>
6 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.<br>
7 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 7: 1-7 (NLT)<br>
1 Now regarding the questions you asked in your letter.<br>
<br>
(Yes, it is good to live a celibate life.)<br>
(Yes, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.)<br>
Yes, it is good to abstain from sexual relations.<br>
2 But because there is so much sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.<br>
3 The husband should fulfil his wife's sexual needs, and the wife should fulfil her husband's needs.<br>
4 The wife gives authority over her body to her husband, and the husband gives authority over his body to his wife.<br>
5 Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterwards, you should come together again so that Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.<br>
6 I say this as a concession, not as a command.<br>
7 But I wish everyone were single, just as I am. Yet each person has a special gift from God, of one kind or another.<br>

Case-Building<br>
<br>
<br>
This is only a little snip from the story about Balaam and His Donkey...<br>
Numbers 22: 26-33 (NLT)<br>
26 Then the angel of the Lord moved farther down the road and stood in a place too narrow for the donkey to get by at all.<br>
27 This time when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down under Balaam. In a fit of rage Balaam beat the animal again with his staff.<br>
28 Then the Lord gave the donkey the ability to speak. "What have I done to you that deserves your beating me three times?" it asked Balaam.<br>
29 "You have made me look like a fool!" Balaam shouted. "If I had a sword with me, I would kill you!"<br>
30 "But I am the same donkey you have ridden all your life," the donkey answered. "Have I ever done anything like this before?"<br>
"No," Balaam admitted.<br>
31 Then the Lord opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the roadway with a drawn sword in his hand. Balaam bowed his head and fell face down on the ground before him.<br>
32 "Why did you beat your donkey those three times?" the angel of the Lord demanded. "Look, I have come to block your way because you are stubbornly resisting me.<br>
33 Three times the donkey saw me and shied away; otherwise, I would certainly have killed you by now and spared the donkey."<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT<br>
Numbers 31:  verse 1, verse 2, then verses 7 and 8, NLT...<br>
1 Then the Lord said to Moses,<br>
2 "On behalf of the people of Israel, take revenge on the Midianites for leading them into idolatry....<br>
<br>
7 They attacked Midian as the Lord had commanded Moses, and they killed all the men.<br>
8 All five of the Midianite kings -- Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba -- died in the battle. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Balaam could kind-of, sort-of hear from the Lord, and knew about the Lord to a certain extent,<br>
but Balaam did not truly follow and obey the Lord.<br>
Balaam would not even listen to his own talking Donkey, and now he has been killed with the sword.<br>
The Torah, the Bible, is like a sharp sword.<br>
Study it and obey it because, the main point that the Bible is trying to get into you, you'll get that point into you, one way or another.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 3:13 (KJV)<br>
And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 3: 10-14 NLT<br>
10 We had now conquered all the cities on the plateau and all Gilead and Bashan, as far as the towns of Salecah and Edrei, which were part of Og's kingdom in Bashan.<br>
(King Og of Bashan was a giant. His bed was made of iron and was more than 9 cubits long, which was more than 4.1 metres long, and 4 cubits wide, which was 1.8 metres wide.)<br>
11 (King Og of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.)<br>
<br>
12 "When we took possession of this land, I gave to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory beyond Aroer along the Arnon Gorge, plus half of the hill country of Gilead with its towns.<br>
13 Then I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan -- Og's former kingdom -- to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (This entire Argob region of Bashan used to be known as the land of the Rephaites.<br>
14 Jair, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh, conquered the whole Argob region in Bashan, all the way to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. Jair renamed this region after himself, (calling it the Towns of Havvoth-jair,) calling it the Towns of Jair, as it is still known today.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Because we have some big chunks of scripture to read here next, we will only read it in the NLT.<br>
<br>
Numbers 32 NLT, some selected verses.<br>
Here in Numbers 32, we will read, verses 1 and 2, followed by verses 4, 5 and 6,<br>
and then we will jump down to verse 16 and read through verse 27, only in the NLT.<br>
<br>
1 The tribes of Reuben and Gad owned vast numbers of livestock. So when they saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were ideally suited for their flocks and herds,<br>
2 they came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the other leaders of the community.<br>
<br>
4 The Lord has conquered this whole area for the community of Israel, and it is ideally suited for all our livestock.<br>
5 If we have found favour with you, please let us have this land as our property instead of giving us land across the Jordan River."<br>
6 "Do you intend to stay here whilst your brothers go across and do all the fighting?" Moses asked the men of Gad and Reuben.<br>
<br>
They give their answer when we jump down to Numbers 32, verse 16, and keep reading to verse 27.<br>
<br>
16 But they approached Moses and said, "We simply want to build pens for our livestock and fortified towns for our wives and children.<br>
17 Then we will arm ourselves and lead our fellow Israelites into battle until we have brought them safely to their land. Meanwhile, our families will stay in the fortified towns we build here, so they will be safe from any attacks by the local people.<br>
18 We will not return to our homes until all the people of Israel have received their portions of land.<br>
19 But we do not claim any of the land on the other side of the Jordan. We would rather live here on the east side and accept this as our grant of land."<br>
20 Then Moses said, "If you keep your word and arm yourselves for the Lord's battles,<br>
21 and if your troops cross the Jordan and keep fighting until the Lord has driven out his enemies,<br>
22 then you may return when the Lord has conquered the land. You will have fulfilled your duty to the Lord and to the rest of the people of Israel. And the land on the east side of the Jordan will be your property from the Lord.<br>
23 But if you fail to keep your word, then you will have sinned against the Lord, and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.<br>
24 Go ahead and build towns for your families and pens for your flocks, but do everything you have promised."<br>
25 Then the men of Gad and Reuben replied, "We, your servants, will follow your instructions exactly.<br>
26 Our children, wives, flocks, and cattle will stay here in the towns of Gilead.<br>
27 But all who are able to bear arms will cross over to fight for the Lord, just as you have said."<br>
<br>
That was Numbers 32, verse 27.<br>
and then they basically say that last part again, here in Numbers 32, verses 31 through 33...<br>
<br>
31 The tribes of Gad and Reuben said again, "We are your servants, and we will do as the Lord has commanded!<br>
32 We will cross the Jordan into Canaan fully armed to fight for the Lord, but our property will be here on this side of the Jordan."<br>
33 So Moses assigned land to the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 29: 7 & 8 (NLT)<br>
7 "When we came here, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them.<br>
8 We took their land and gave it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh as their grant of land.<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 1:10-18 (NLT)<br>
10 Joshua then commanded the officers of Israel,<br>
11 "Go through the camp and tell the people to get their provisions ready. In three days you will cross the Jordan River and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you."<br>
12 Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. He told them,<br>
13 "Remember what Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you: 'The Lord your God is giving you a place of rest. He has given you this land.'<br>
14 Your wives, children, and livestock may remain here in the land Moses assigned to you on the east side of the Jordan River. But your strong warriors, fully armed, must lead the other tribes across the Jordan to help them conquer their territory. Stay with them<br>
15 until the Lord gives them rest, as he has given you rest, and until they, too, possess the land the Lord your God is giving them. Only then may you return and settle here on the east side of the Jordan River in the land that Moses, the servant of the Lord, assigned to you."<br>
16 They answered Joshua, "We will do whatever you command us, and we will go wherever you send us.<br>
17 We will obey you just as we obeyed Moses. And may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses.<br>
18 Anyone who rebels against your orders and does not obey your words and everything you command will be put to death. So be strong and courageous!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 12: 4-6 (KJV)<br>
4 And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,<br>
5 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.<br>
6 Them did Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 12: 4-6 (NLT)<br>
4 King Og of Bashan, the last of the Rephaites, lived at Ashtaroth and Edrei.<br>
5 He ruled a territory stretching from Mount Hermon to Salecah in the north and to all of Bashan in the east, and westward to the borders of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah. This territory included the northern half of Gilead, as far as the boundary of King Sihon of Heshbon.<br>
6 Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the Israelites had destroyed the people of King Sihon and King Og. And Moses gave their land as a possession to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 21, verse 43 through 45, the last three verses of chapter 21,<br>
then we will keep on reading into chapter 22,<br>
and we will read all of chapter 22, Joshua 22, reading all 34 verses of chapter 22.<br>
Because this is a bigger portion to read, we will only be reading this in the NLT.<br>
Joshua chapter 21 starting in verse 43,<br>
and reading all the way through the end of chapter 22. NLT<br>
<br>
43 So the Lord gave to Israel all the land he had sworn to give their ancestors, and they took possession of it and settled there.<br>
44 And the Lord gave them rest on every side, just as he had solemnly promised their ancestors. None of their enemies could stand against them, for the Lord helped them conquer all their enemies.<br>
45 Not a single one of all the good promises the Lord had given to the family of Israel was left unfulfilled; everything he had spoken came true.<br>
1 Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.<br>
2 He told them, "You have done as Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you, and you have obeyed every order I have given you.<br>
3 During all this time you have not deserted the other tribes. You have been careful to obey the commands of the Lord your God right up to the present day.<br>
4 And now the Lord your God has given the other tribes rest, as he promised them. So go back home to the land that Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave you as your possession on the east side of the Jordan River.<br>
5 But be very careful to obey all the commands and the instructions that Moses gave to you. Love the Lord your God, walk in all his ways, obey his commands, hold firmly to him, and serve him with all your heart and all your soul."<br>
6 So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went home.<br>
<br>
7 Moses had given the land of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The other half of the tribe was given land west of the Jordan.) As Joshua sent them away and blessed them,<br>
8 he said to them, "Go back to your homes with the great wealth you have taken from your enemies -- the vast herds of livestock, the silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and the large supply of clothing. Share the plunder with your relatives."<br>
9 So the men of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the rest of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan. They started the journey back to their own land of Gilead, the territory that belonged to them according to the Lord's command through Moses.<br>
<br>
10 But whilst they were still in Canaan, and when they came to (the circle of stones, which was) a place called Geliloth near the Jordan River, the men of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh stopped to build a large and imposing altar.<br>
<br>
<br>
11 The rest of Israel heard that the people of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar at Geliloth at the edge of the land of Canaan, on the west side of the Jordan River.<br>
12 So the whole community of Israel gathered at Shiloh and prepared to go to war against them.<br>
13 First, however, they sent a delegation led by Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to talk with the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.<br>
14 In this delegation were ten leaders of Israel, one from each of the ten tribes, and each the head of his family within the clans of Israel.<br>
15 When they arrived in the land of Gilead, they said to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,<br>
16 "The whole community of the Lord demands to know why you are betraying the God of Israel. How could you turn away from the Lord and build an altar for yourselves in rebellion against him?<br>
17 Was our sin at Peor not enough? To this day we are not fully cleansed of it, even after the plague that struck the entire community of the Lord.<br>
18 And yet today you are turning away from following the Lord. If you rebel against the Lord today, he will be angry with all of us tomorrow.<br>
19 "If you need the altar because the land you possess is defiled, then join us in the Lord's land, where the Tabernacle of the Lord is situated, and share our land with us. But do not rebel against the Lord or against us by building an altar other than the one true altar of the Lord our God.<br>
20 Didn't divine anger fall on the entire community of Israel when Achan, a member of the clan of Zerah, sinned by stealing the things set apart for the Lord? He was not the only one who died because of his sin."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The wording just now, where it said,<br>
the things set apart for the Lord,<br>
That Hebrew term is also usually worded as saying, completely destroy.<br>
The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
21 Then the people of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the heads of the clans of Israel:<br>
22 "The Lord, the Mighty One, is God! The Lord, the Mighty One, is God! He knows the truth, and may Israel know it, too! We have not built the altar in treacherous rebellion against the Lord. If we have done so, do not spare our lives this day.<br>
23 If we have built an altar for ourselves to turn away from the Lord or to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings, may the Lord himself punish us.<br>
24 "The truth is, we have built this altar because we fear that in the future your descendants will say to ours, 'What right do you have to worship the Lord, the God of Israel?<br>
25 The Lord has placed the Jordan River as a barrier between our people and you people of Reuben and Gad. You have no claim to the Lord.' So your descendants may prevent our descendants from worshipping the Lord.<br>
26 "So we decided to build the altar, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices,<br>
27 but as a memorial. It will remind our descendants and your descendants that we, too, have the right to worship the Lord at his sanctuary with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings. Then your descendants will not be able to say to ours, 'You have no claim to the Lord.'<br>
28 "If they say this, our descendants can reply, 'Look at this copy of the Lord's altar that our ancestors made. It is not for burnt offerings or sacrifices; it is a reminder of the relationship both of us have with the Lord.'<br>
29 Far be it from us to rebel against the Lord or turn away from him by building our own altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices. Only the altar of the Lord our God that stands in front of the Tabernacle may be used for that purpose."<br>
30 When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community -- the heads of the clans of Israel -- heard this from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, they were satisfied.<br>
31 Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, replied to them, "Today we know the Lord is among us because you have not committed this treachery against the Lord as we thought. Instead, you have rescued Israel from being destroyed by the hand of the Lord."<br>
32 Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the other leaders left the tribes of Reuben and Gad in Gilead and returned to the land of Canaan to tell the Israelites what had happened.<br>
33 And all the Israelites were satisfied and praised God and spoke no more of war against Reuben and Gad.<br>
34 The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar "Witness," for they said, "It is a witness between us and them that the Lord is our God, too."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 22:34 (KJV)<br>
And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the Lord is God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 18: 15-17 KJV<br>
15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.<br>
16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.<br>
17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 18: 15-17 NLT<br>
(If your brother sins, If another believer sins,)<br>
15 "If another believer sins against you, go privately and point out the offence. If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back.<br>
16 But if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others with you and go back again, so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses.<br>
17 If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church. Then if he or she won't accept the church's decision, treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector.<br>
<br>

Commentary: We did a Bible study, back in Christian Essays 7,<br>
and the study was titled, Controlling the Tongue.<br>
We saw in that study, many Bible verses that teach us not to spread gossip and rumours.<br>
Here is a little snip from that commentary...<br>
People that enjoy spreading gossip are known as talebearers or whisperers.<br>
The Bible teaches us that, one of the ways how we can help to control our tongue, is to avoid talebearing, being a tale-bearer, and to avoid the spreading of gossip and rumours.<br>
In other words, avoid judging other people that are not there, with you, and avoid talking about someone if that person is not there, in the same room with you at that time.<br>
<br>
This big study that we just did in the book of Joshua 22 shows us what happens when we talk about someone, or a group of people, and we do not confront them about it directly.  We want to avoid sin, and we are looking out for sin trying to sneak in and creep in, and that can lead to judging others, which is a sin.  Gossip and rumours are when we talk and judge, but do not directly confront the sin that we think we detect in others.  This leads to case-building, which is when we build up a case against a person or a group of people, without considering their side of the problem, without finding out what their perspective is, without letting them speak out and voice their side of the matter that is being judged as sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
What we just saw in Matthew 18: 15-17 was the escalation procedure for dealing with sin that someone has and is not aware of having.  Jesus teaches the opposite of what the people did in Joshua 22. We start with Level 1.  Talk directly to the person, and don't go behind his or her back and talk to others about it first.  Talk directly to and only to the person or group that appears to be in sin.  Then, if that does not resolve the issue, escalate it to level 2, where witnesses accompany you, and if that does not work, escalate to level 3, where the entire church is involved.  Don't take it to levels 2 and 3 without first starting at level 1, based on the instructions that Jesus gave us there in Matthew 18: 15-17.  Maybe you are misinterpreting or misunderstanding a situation, and your judgement is really the sin.  You need to receive the additional information from the other side of the story, and see the other side of the coin, and get the other's perspective.   The people that built up a case against those other tribes, I imagine that they were quite embarrassed when they learnt that, what they thought was a copy of the altar, was actually a memorial, to help everyone remember that, those other two and a half tribes on the other side of the Jordan river, also belong to the Lord.  Let us learn a lesson from all of this. When there is a threat of sin coming from someone, and they do not seem to be aware of it, don't be like those case-builders in Joshua 22.  Instead, follow the instructions and the escalation procedure that Jesus Christ has laid out before us.<br>

Joshua 23:6 -- KJV<br>
6 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do (all that is written in the Torah) all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;<br>
<br>
Joshua 23:6 -- NLT<br>
6 "So be very careful to follow everything Moses wrote in the Book of Instruction. Do not deviate from it, turning either to the right or to the left.<br>

Joshua 23: 10 & 11 -- KJV<br>
10 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.<br>
(Take good heed therefore unto your souls,)<br>
11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the Lord your God.<br>

Joshua 23: 10 & 11 -- NLT<br>

Romans 3: 20-24 -- KJV<br>
20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.<br>
21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;<br>
22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:<br>
23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br>
24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 3: 20-24 -- NLT<br>
20 For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands. The law simply shows us how sinful we are.<br>
21 But now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the requirements of the law, as was promised (in the law,) in the writings of Moses and the prophets long ago.<br>
22 We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are.<br>
23 For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God's glorious standard.<br>
24 Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 3: 27 & 28 -- KJV<br>
27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.<br>
28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 3: 27 & 28 -- NLT<br>
27 Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on obeying the law. It is based on faith.<br>
28 So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law.<br>
<br>

<br>
John 5:39 (KJV)<br>
Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.<br>

"You search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. But the Scriptures point to me!<br>

<br>
Romans 3:31 (KJV)<br>
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.<br>
<br>
Romans 3:31 (NLT)<br>
Well then, if we emphasise faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfil the law.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:2 (KJV)<br>
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.<br>

Galatians 6:2 (NLT)<br>
Share each other's burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5:17 (KJV)<br>
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br>
<br>
Matthew 5:17 (NLT)<br>
"Don't misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose.<br>

<br>
Galatians 5:14 (KJV)<br>
For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
<br>
Galatians 5:14 (NLT)<br>
For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbour as yourself."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8:4 (KJV)<br>
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 1-9 (NLT)<br>
1 So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.<br>
2 And because you belong to him, (the law of the life-giving Spirit, and) the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you (and me) from the power of sin that leads to death.<br>
3 The law of Moses was unable to save us because of (the weakness of our flesh, and) the weakness of our sinful nature. So God did what the law could not do. He sent his own Son in a body like the bodies we sinners have. And in that body God declared an end to sin's control over us by giving his Son as a sacrifice for our sins.<br>
4 He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit.<br>
5 Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit.<br>
6 So letting (your flesh and) your sinful nature control your mind leads to death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace.<br>
7 For the sinful nature is always hostile to God. It never did obey God's laws, and it never will.<br>
8 That's why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God.<br>
9 (But you are not controlled by your flesh.) But you are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all.)<br>

Back when we were in Christian Essays 2, we did a study titled,<br>
The Doer<br>
and the main message was,<br>
Don't just read it, study it -- don't just hear the Bible, Do the Bible, Do What it is telling you to do.<br>
In that study, we looked at a little bit of Psalms 101.<br>
Now, let's read all eight verses of Psalms 101.<br>
<br>
When we looked at this, back in that earlier Bible study,<br>
when we got to verse 3, we looked up the word, Belial, in the Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Strong's Concordance, which is a Bible concordance, an index of every word in the King James Version (KJV) Bible, constructed under the direction of James Strong, first published in 1890.<br>
According to the Strong's Concordance, the Hebrew word, Belial, means, without profit, worthlessness, destruction, wickedness, evil, naughty, ungodly (people), wicked.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 101, all of Psalms 101,<br>
all 8 verses. KJV<br>
A Psalm of David.<br>
1 I will sing of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.<br>
2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.<br>
<br>
(I will set no thing of Belial before mine eyes)<br>
3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.<br>
<br>
4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.<br>
5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.<br>
<br>
6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me:<br>
(he that walketh perfect in the way, he shall serve me.)<br>
he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.<br>
<br>
7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house:<br>
(he that telleth lies shall not be established in my sight.)<br>
he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.<br>
<br>
8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord.<br>

and liars will not stay in my presence.<br>

My daily task will be to ferret out the wicked<br>
and free the city of the Lord from their grip.<br>

all 8 verses. NIV<br>
Of David. A psalm.<br>
1<br>
I will sing of your love and justice;<br>
to you, Lord, I will sing praise.<br>

I will not tolerate.<br>
6<br>
My eyes will be on the faithful in the land,<br>
that they may dwell with me;<br>
the one whose walk is blameless<br>
will minister to me.<br>
7<br>
No one who practices deceit<br>
will dwell in my house;<br>
no one who speaks falsely<br>
will stand in my presence.<br>
8<br>
Every morning I will put to silence<br>
all the wicked in the land;<br>
I will cut off every evildoer<br>
from the city of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
As of November 2020, there is now a new 2020 edition of the<br>
New American Standard Bible (NASB).<br>
Since this new 2020 edition has not yet been evaluated,<br>
we will continue to study and read from the 1995 edition of the NASB.<br>
Only on a few rare occasions do we read from the NASB in our Bible studies.<br>
<br>

To You, O Lord, I will sing praises.<br>

I will give heed to the blameless way.<br>
(I will give heed to the way of integrity.)<br>
When will You come to me?<br>
I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.<br>
3<br>
I will set no worthless thing before my eyes;<br>
I hate the work of those who fall away;<br>
It shall not fasten its grip on me.<br>
4<br>
A perverse heart shall depart from me;<br>
I will know no evil.<br>
5<br>
Whoever secretly slanders his neighbour, him I will destroy;<br>
No one who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart will I endure.<br>
6<br>
My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me;<br>
(He who walks in a way of integrity is the one who will minister to me.)<br>
He who walks in a blameless way is the one who will minister to me.<br>
7<br>
He who practices deceit shall not dwell within my house;<br>
He who speaks falsehood shall not maintain his position before me.<br>
8<br>

Proverbs 11:27 (KJV)<br>
He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 11:27 (NLT)<br>
If you search for good, you will find favour; but if you search for evil, it will find you!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 11: 22-28 (KJV)<br>
22 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.<br>
(As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which departeth from discretion.)<br>
<br>
23 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.<br>
24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.<br>
<br>
<br>
25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.<br>
(The soul of blessing shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.)<br>
<br>
26 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.<br>
27 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.<br>
28 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 11: 22-28 (NLT)<br>
22<br>
A beautiful woman who lacks discretion<br>
is like a gold ring in a pig's snout.<br>
23<br>
The godly can look forward to a reward,<br>
whilst the wicked can expect only judgement.<br>
24<br>
Give freely and become more wealthy;<br>
be stingy and lose everything.<br>
25<br>
The generous will prosper;<br>
those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed.<br>
26<br>
People curse those who hoard their grain,<br>
but they bless the one who sells in time of need.<br>
27<br>
If you search for good, you will find favour;<br>
but if you search for evil, it will find you!<br>
28<br>
Trust in your money and down you go!<br>
But the godly flourish like leaves in spring.<br>

Here again are two verses that we read when we did our study on Passover in Christian Essays 9...<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4:2 -- KJV<br>
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4:2 -- NLT<br>
Do not add to or subtract from these commands I am giving you. Just obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 12:32 (KJV)<br>
What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 12:32 (NLT)<br>
So be careful to obey all the commands I give you. You must not add anything to them or subtract anything from them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And, here's something in the book of Proverbs that would go along with those...<br>
<br>
Proverbs 30: 5 & 6 KJV<br>
(Every word of God is purified:)<br>
5 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.<br>
6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 30: 4-6 NLT<br>
4<br>
Who but God goes up to heaven and comes back down?<br>
Who holds the wind in his fists?<br>
Who wraps up the oceans in his cloak?<br>
Who has created the whole wide world?<br>
What is his name -- and his son's name?<br>
Tell me if you know!<br>
5<br>
Every word of God proves true.<br>
He is a shield to all who come to him for protection.<br>
6<br>
Do not add to his words,<br>
or he may rebuke you and expose you as a liar.<br>
<br>
<br>
After you read this next bit from the book of Proverbs,<br>
pray about this, and apply it to your life, yourself, your family, and your children.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 23: 4 & 5 KJV<br>
4<br>
Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.<br>
(Wilt thou cause thine eyes to fly upon that which is not?)<br>
5<br>
Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not?<br>
for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 23: 4 & 5 NLT<br>
4<br>
Don't wear yourself out trying to get rich.<br>
Be wise enough to know when to quit.<br>
5<br>
In the blink of an eye wealth disappears,<br>
for it will sprout wings<br>
and fly away like an eagle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 30: 7-9 KJV<br>
7<br>
Two things have I required of thee;<br>
(withhold not from me before I die:)<br>
deny me them not before I die:<br>
8<br>
Remove far from me vanity and lies:<br>
give me neither poverty nor riches;<br>
(feed me with food of my allowance for me:)<br>
feed me with food convenient for me:<br>
9<br>
(Lest I be full, and belie thee, and say, Who is the Lord?)<br>
Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord?<br>
or lest I be poor, and steal,<br>
and take the name of my God in vain.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 30: 7-9 NLT<br>
7<br>
O God, I beg two favours from you;<br>
let me have them before I die.<br>
8<br>
First, help me never to tell a lie.<br>
Second, give me neither poverty nor riches!<br>
Give me just enough to satisfy my needs.<br>
9<br>
For if I grow rich, I may deny you and say, "Who is the Lord?"<br>
And if I am too poor, I may steal and thus insult God's holy name.<br>

The album, titled, Hymn of Heaven, is the eighth studio album by American contemporary Christian singer, Phil Wickham.<br>
The album, Hymn of Heaven, was released on 25 June 2021.<br>
As of August 2021, the singles that were released from this album thus far, include,<br>
the song "Battle Belongs," which was released as a single on 4 September 2020.<br>
This song, Battle Belongs, has some amazing content that points to<br>
2 Chronicles 20, verse 15  where it mentions<br>
that the battle belongs to God, not you.<br>
The message would basically be that,<br>
Whatever you are facing or dealing with, give it to the Lord God,<br>
and let him deal with it for you, let him fight it out for you.<br>
Whatever battle you face, that battle belongs to the Lord.<br>
It basically says this, in that area of 2 Chronicles 20, verse 15...<br>
the Spirit of the Lord came upon one of the men standing there,<br>
a Levite who was a descendant of Asaph.<br>
He said, "Listen, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem!<br>
Listen, King Jehoshaphat!<br>
This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid!<br>
Don't be discouraged by this mighty army,<br>
for the battle is not yours, but God's.<br>
<br>
We will read that story in greater detail when we start the next chapter of The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 19,<br>
Christian Essays 19, when we begin by doing a Bible study in there, titled,<br>
Jumping Jehoshaphat and False Prophets.<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, the second single from Phil Wickham's album, Hymn of Heaven, was the song, "House of the Lord," released as a single on 2 April 2021.<br>
And, after that, the song, "It's Always Been You" was released as a promotional single on 14 May 2021.<br>
<br>
There are two songs on this album that have lyrics that I wanted to share with you.<br>
<br>
Let's begin by taking a look at the words of the second single.<br>
Here are the words to the 2021 song, "House Of The Lord" by Phil Wickham...<br>
<br>
We worship the God who was<br>

The second song that I wanted to tell you about is<br>
found on this album at track number 8.<br>
It's called, 1000 Names.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's read the words to this song right now.<br>
Also found on his album, Hymn of Heaven,<br>
Here are the lyrics to the 2021 song, 1000 Names, by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
I call you Maker<br>
You give life an eternal spark<br>
I call you Healer<br>
You can mend any broken heart<br>
I call you Faithful Father<br>
You finish everything You start<br>
My soul was made to respond<br>
<br>
I know You by a thousand names<br>
And You deserve every single one<br>
You've given me a million ways<br>
To be amazed at what You've done<br>
And I am lost in wonder at all You do<br>
I know You by a thousand names<br>
And I'll sing them back to You, yeah<br>
Sing them back, sing them back to You<br>
<br>
Your love is boundless<br>
Beyond what I could dream<br>
Your grace is patient<br>
You're never giving up on me<br>
I call You Bondage Breaker<br>
'Cause You're handing out the prison keys<br>
My soul was made to be free<br>
<br>
I know You by a thousand names<br>
And You deserve every single one<br>
You've given me a million ways<br>
To be amazed at what You've done<br>
And I am lost in wonder at all You do<br>
I know You by a thousand names<br>
And I'll sing them back, I'll sing them back to You<br>
Oh, back to You<br>
Back to You, God<br>
<br>
You are Rock of Ages<br>
You're the Great I Am<br>
You are King forever<br>
The beginning and the end<br>
<br>
You are Lord and servant<br>
You're the Son of Man<br>
You're the Lion of Judah<br>
You're the risen Lamb<br>
<br>
You're the second Adam<br>
Here to lead us home<br>
You are Yahweh's glory<br>
Now revealed in flesh and bone<br>
<br>
You are Ocean Parter<br>
You will make a way<br>
You are Death Defeater<br>
You have risen from the grave<br>
<br>
You are full of mercy<br>
You are rich in love<br>
You are Jesus, Messiah<br>
The one true God<br>
<br>
I know You by a thousand names<br>
And You deserve every single one<br>
You've given me a million ways<br>
To be amazed at what You've done<br>
And I am lost in wonder<br>
at all You do<br>
I know You by a thousand names<br>
And I'll sing them back, I'll sing them back to You<br>
Oh, back to You<br>
<br>
Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah<br>
Sing them back to You<br>
You are full of mercy<br>
You're rich in love<br>
You are Jesus, Messiah<br>
The one true God, hallelujah<br>
Hallelujah<br>
<br>
<br>
