This is an electronic version of a Christian Church Service. This is a Bible Study, where we study and learn about our Father in Heaven, our Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty, Holy God, Messiah, Lord, Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Because we study the entire Bible, including all of the Old Testament, and all of the New Testament, praying in the name of Jesus Christ, in the name of Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, Yeh-Shew-Uh, the following warning may be applicable on some occasions.<br>
<br>
Warning. Discretion is advised.<br>
The Bible verses that we read, and the comments and opinions shared, may not be appropriate for all audiences.<br>
Non-Christian audiences may be offended.<br>
Parents are strongly cautioned. Some content is intended only for mature audiences.<br>
Some content is intended only for mature Christians.<br>
Some of this content may sometimes be inappropriate, objectionable or offensive to non-Christians, or audiences of other religions.<br>
Some studies may possibly contain, mature subject matter, Adult Content, offensive content, sexually explicit content, and explicit content that may be disturbing or upsetting, especially for children and non-Christians.<br>
Some studies may contain opinions, comments and views that are in opposition to other religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
Warning!<br>
Some parts of the Bible contain mature subject matter, adult themes, strong adult content and sexual content that may not be suitable for young children.<br>
Some people may find Bible studies to be offensive, and those people may respond with legal persecutions, including lawsuits, or illegal, criminal actions.<br>
Caution. Christians meeting together, and gathering together as a group of people, Bible ownership, Bible reading, and Christian Church services may be illegal in certain areas, possibly resulting in arrest, torture, imprisonment or death.<br>
Some governments in some countries may have passed laws that make owning or reading a Bible to be illegal in certain places, and make take actions against those participants, resulting in prison, torture or death.<br>
Some of the content in a Bible study may contain Bible verse readings, quotations, commentaries, details and descriptions that may be considered graphic, sexually-explicit, disturbing or upsetting.<br>
<br>
This is an English Bible study, with readings from English Bibles.<br>
We may sometimes attempt to pray and speak the name of the Heavenly Father and His only begotten Son in the original, ancient Hebrew language.<br>
We usually like to read verses from the King James Version (KJV) (1611), and the fifth edition of the New Living Translation (NLT) (2015).<br>

<a name="JAH16SCRIPTRINE"></a><h2>Doctrine</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Doctrine<br>
<br>
<br>
In this Bible study, we will be taking a look at some Bible verses<br>
that mention the word, Doctrine.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the New Testament, the English word, Doctrine, was translated<br>
out of the Greek word, Dee-Dah-Skell-EE-Uh.<br>
Dee-Dah-Skell-EE-Uh, means, teaching.<br>
<br>
That Greek word is used 21 times in the New Testament.<br>
It was especially used in the books of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.<br>
<br>
This Greek word, Dee-Dah-Skell-EE-Uh, that means, Teaching, comes from another Greek word<br>
that means, Teacher.  Well, that would make sense.<br>
A Teaching comes from a teacher.<br>
<br>
Luke 4:32 also has the word, Doctrine.<br>
But that Greek word originally there is, Dee-Dah-Key.<br>
Dee-Dah-Key also means, teaching.<br>
It sounds more like a verb or action.<br>
<br>
In English, it would be like saying this...<br>
A teacher is teaching us a teaching that he typed up last night.<br>
In that sentence, teaching is an action word, a verb,<br>
and then the material that the teacher is reading and sharing<br>
would also be called a teaching.<br>
<br>
It looks like the verb and the noun would be different Greek words.<br>
The teacher is Dee-Dah-Key a Dee-Dah-Skell-EE-Uh.<br>
The teacher is teaching a teaching.<br>
<br>
Once again, that first Greek word that we mentioned earlier, Dee-Dah-Skell-EE-Uh, is used 21 times in the New Testament.<br>
<br>
This second Greek word, which is Dee-Dah-Key, is a Greek word<br>
that we found in the New Testament, 30 times.<br>
Dee-Dah-Key is in Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, and 6 more books besides those,<br>
all the way to end, found even three times in Revelation 2.<br>
<br>
Both Greek words that were translated into the English word, Doctrine,<br>
both basically mean, teaching and instruction,<br>
some kind of material that contains or holds a teaching,<br>
as well as the action of delivering the teaching or instruction to an audience.<br>
<br>
Those are the two Greek words in the New Testament for Doctrine.<br>
What about the word, Doctrine, in the Old Testament?<br>
That would be an ancient Hebrew word that was translated into our English word, Doctrine.<br>
<br>
There is one Hebrew word that was translated into, Doctrine.<br>
It is the Hebrew word that is pronounced, Leh Kahhh.<br>
The letter H sound at the end is very strongly sounded and drawn out longer.<br>
<br>
This Hebrew word, Leh Kahhh, typically means,<br>
learning, teaching, insight, instruction,<br>
delivering and receiving instruction,<br>
teaching-power and persuasiveness.<br>
That Hebrew word is used 6 times in the Book of Proverbs, and once in three other Old Testament books.<br>
<br>
That Hebrew word, Leh Kahhh, is a masculine noun.<br>
There is also a different Hebrew word that was also translated<br>
into the English word, doctrine, but only one time...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28:9 (KJV)<br>
Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The New, Baby Christians that graduate from breastmilk to solid foods and meats will be made to have a better, deeper, richer understanding of the Bible.<br>
Are you stuck in Kindergarten and first grade, over and over again, year after year, because it's easy and familiar to you?<br>
If anyone asks you why you left that church, just tell them that you have graduated.<br>
Go to the next level in your Bible study, and that will make you go to the next level in your relationship with the Lord Jesus, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
Go deeper and go to the next level.  That is exactly what these teachings right here are trying to do right now.<br>
<br>
Again, looking at that word, Doctrine, in Isaiah 28:9, this is not same Hebrew word that we saw earlier.<br>
<br>
<br>
That second Hebrew word there in Isaiah 28:9 that was translated into the English word, doctrine,<br>
is pronounced, Shem-eh-Wah.  It may also be pronounced without the Wuh sound, like this...<br>
Shem-uh-ah.   So, it can be said like this, Shem-eh-Wah, or Shem-uh-ah.<br>
<br>
The first Hebrew word that we talked about earlier was a masculine noun.<br>
This second Hebrew word is a feminine noun.<br>
<br>
What is interesting is that, this second, feminine noun word,<br>
Shem-eh-Wah, or Shem-uh-ah<br>
is used 27 times in the Old Testament, but it is only turned into the<br>
word, Doctrine, just that one time, there in Isaiah 28:9.<br>
<br>
The other 26 times, it usually gets translated into<br>
the English words,<br>
fame, news, report, rumour, or tidings.<br>
<br>
It means, something heard, that is, an announcement.<br>
<br>
So, again, we usually see it end up being translated into<br>
the English words, fame, news, report, rumour, or tidings.<br>
But only one time did it end up being the word, Doctrine.<br>
<br>
In a moment, we will look at these verses in the Old and New Testament<br>
that have the word, Doctrine.<br>
<br>
Before we do, how do the English dictionaries define the word, Doctrine?<br>
Let's take a look at a few of them...<br>
<br>
<br>
Dictionary definitions of the word, Doctrine.<br>
<br>
Longman Dictionary:<br>
Doctrine is a set of beliefs that form an important part of a religion or system of ideas<br>
<br>
Chambers Dictionary:<br>
Doctrine is a thing or things taught, especially any one of a set of religious or political beliefs, or such a set of beliefs.<br>
<br>
Cambridge Dictionary:<br>

<br>
Collins Dictionary:<br>

A doctrine can also be a statement of official government policy, especially foreign policy.<br>
<br>
Oxford Dictionary:<br>
Doctrine is a belief or set of beliefs held and taught by a Church, a political party, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's now look at KJV Bible verses that have the word, Doctrine...<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 15:9 (KJV)<br>
But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<br>
<br>
Matthew 15: 7-9 NLT<br>
7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, for he wrote,<br>
8<br>
'These people honour me with their lips,<br>
but their hearts are far from me.<br>
9<br>
Their worship is a farce,<br>
for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.'"<br>
<br>
Jesus is quoting from the Greek Version of the book of Isaiah 29:13<br>
<br>
Let's read the Isaiah 29:13, KJV, which is translated from the original, ancient Hebrew...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 29: 12 & 13 KJV<br>
12 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.<br>
13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 29: 12 & 13 NLT of the original Hebrew<br>
12 When you give it to those who cannot read, they will say, "We don't know how to read."<br>
13 And so the Lord says,<br>
"These people say they are mine.<br>
They honour me with their lips,<br>
but their hearts are far from me.<br>
And their worship of me<br>
is nothing but man-made rules learned by rote.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 29: verse 13 NLT of the Greek Version:<br>
Their worship is a farce,<br>
for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 29: verses 12 & 13, the Greek version also gets quoted in the book of Mark.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 7: 6-9(KJV)<br>
6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.<br>
7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<br>
8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.<br>
9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 7: 6-9 NLT<br>
6 Jesus replied, "You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, for he wrote,<br>
'These people honour me with their lips,<br>
but their hearts are far from me.<br>
7<br>
Their worship is a farce,<br>
for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.'<br>
8 For you ignore God's law and substitute your own tradition."<br>
9 Then he said, "You skilfully sidestep God's law in order to hold on to your own tradition.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 4:32 (KJV)<br>
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.<br>
<br>
Luke 4: 31 & 32 NLT<br>
31 Then Jesus went to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and taught there in the synagogue every Sabbath day.<br>
32 There, too, the people were amazed at his teaching, for he spoke with authority.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 7:16 (KJV)<br>
Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.<br>
<br>
John 7:16 (NLT)<br>
So Jesus told them, "My message is not my own; it comes from God who sent me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 3:10 (KJV)<br>
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,<br>
<br>
We will take a deeper look at 2 Timothy 3 here in just a moment.<br>
But, before we do, let's look at a few other verses...<br>
<br>
2 John 1:9 (KJV)<br>
Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 John 1:9 NLT<br>
9 Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God. But anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both the Father and the Son.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 2:1 (KJV)<br>
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:<br>
<br>
Titus 2:1 (NLT)<br>
...promote the kind of living that reflects wholesome teaching.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4:2 (KJV)<br>
For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4:2 (NLT)<br>
for I am giving you good guidance. Don't turn away from my instructions.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4:13 (KJV)<br>
Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4: 10-13 NLT<br>
...our hope is in the living God, who is the Saviour of all people and particularly of all believers.<br>
11 Teach these things and insist that everyone learn them.<br>
12 Don't let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity.<br>
13 Until I get there, focus on reading the Scriptures to the church, encouraging the believers, and teaching them.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 3: 16 & 17 KJV<br>
16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:<br>
17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 3: 16 & 17 NLT<br>
16 All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realise what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.<br>
17 God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work.<br>
<br>
Let's focus for a moment on 2 Timothy 3.<br>
<br>
Check out this next verse.  It's a promise in the Bible.<br>
As a Christian, the Bible promises that you will suffer persecution!<br>
Name it and claim it!  Blab it and grab it!<br>
It's a promise in the Bible.<br>

KJV of 2 Timothy 3: all 17 verses of chapter 3,<br>
and then keep reading into 2 Timothy 4: verses 1 through 5 (KJV)<br>
Paul is talking to Timothy about The Dangers of the Last Days...<br>
<br>
1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.<br>
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,<br>
3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,<br>
4 Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;<br>
5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.<br>
6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,<br>
7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.<br>
8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.<br>
9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.<br>
10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,<br>
11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.<br>
12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.<br>
13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.<br>
14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;<br>
15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br>
16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:<br>
17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.<br>
1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;<br>
2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<br>
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;<br>
4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.<br>
5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT of 2 Timothy 3: all 17 verses of chapter 3,<br>
and then keep reading into 2 Timothy 4: verses 1 through 5 (NLT)<br>
<br>
Paul is talking to Timothy about The Dangers of the Last Days...<br>
<br>
1 You should know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times.<br>
2 For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred.<br>
3 They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good.<br>
4 They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God.<br>
5 They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that!<br>
<br>
(They are the kind who work their way into people's homes and take captive vulnerable women who are burdened with the guilt of sin and controlled by various desires.)<br>
6 They are the kind who work their way into people's homes and win the confidence of vulnerable women who are burdened with the guilt of sin and controlled by various desires.<br>
<br>
7 (Such women are forever following new teachings, but they are never able to understand the truth.)<br>
8 These teachers oppose the truth just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses. They have depraved minds and a counterfeit faith.<br>
9 But they won't get away with this for long. Someday everyone will recognise what fools they are, just as with Jannes and Jambres.<br>
10 But you, Timothy, certainly know what I teach, and how I live, and what my purpose in life is. You know my faith, my patience, my love, and my endurance.<br>
11 You know how much persecution and suffering I have endured. You know all about how I was persecuted in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra -- but the Lord rescued me from all of it.<br>
12 Yes, and everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.<br>
13 But evil people and impostors will flourish. They will deceive others and will themselves be deceived.<br>
14 But you must remain faithful to the things you have been taught. You know they are true, for you know you can trust those who taught you.<br>
15 You have been taught the holy Scriptures from childhood, and they have given you the wisdom to receive the salvation that comes by trusting in Christ Jesus.<br>
16 All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realise what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.<br>
17 God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work.<br>
1 I solemnly urge you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus, who will someday judge the living and the dead when he comes to set up his Kingdom:<br>
2 Preach the word of God. Be prepared, whether the time is favourable or not. Patiently correct, rebuke, and encourage your people with good teaching<br>
3 For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching. They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear.<br>
4 They will reject the truth and chase after myths.<br>
5 But you should keep a clear mind in every situation. Don't be afraid of suffering for the Lord. Work at telling others the Good News, and fully carry out the ministry God has given you.<br>
<br>
<br>

Remember when we studied the Bible's definition of a Christian Church Service, way back in Christian Essays 1?<br>
<br>
Acts 2:42 (KJV)<br>
And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.<br>
<br>
And, once again, something that we just read a moment ago...<br>
2 Timothy 4:2 (KJV)<br>
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 2:10 (KJV)<br>
Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.<br>
<br>
Titus 2: 7-14 NLT<br>
...Let everything you do reflect the integrity and seriousness of your teaching.<br>
8 Teach the truth so that your teaching can't be criticised. Then those who oppose us will be ashamed and have nothing bad to say about us.<br>
9 Slaves must always obey their masters and do their best to please them. They must not talk back<br>
10 or steal, but must show themselves to be entirely trustworthy and good. Then they will make the teaching about God our Saviour attractive in every way.<br>
11 For the grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all people.<br>
12 And we are instructed to turn from godless living and sinful pleasures. We should live in this evil world with wisdom, righteousness, and devotion to God,<br>
13 whilst we look forward with hope to that wonderful day when the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, will be revealed.<br>
14 He gave his life to free us from every kind of sin, to cleanse us, and to make us his very own people....<br>
<br>
<br>
Here again is that verse that we first looked at when we started this Bible study on doctrine...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28:9 (KJV)<br>
Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 11:18 (KJV)<br>
And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 11: 15-18 NLT<br>
15 When they arrived back in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out the people buying and selling animals for sacrifices. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves,<br>
<br>
(and he stopped everyone from carrying merchandise through the Temple.)<br>
<br>
16 and he stopped everyone from using the Temple as a marketplace.<br>
<br>
17 He said to them, "The Scriptures declare, 'My Temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations,' but you have turned it into a den of thieves."<br>
<br>
(Jesus was quoting Scripture from Isaiah 56:7 and then from Jeremiah 7:11)<br>
<br>
18 When the leading priests and teachers of religious law heard what Jesus had done, they began planning how to kill him. But they were afraid of him because the people were so amazed at his teaching.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  He called this area of the temple where he was standing, his house of prayer.<br>
All nations were allowed into this outer area.  He did not say this in the inner area where only Jews were allowed,<br>
He said this whilst standing in the outer area, where everyone is allowed.<br>
Jesus and his salvation is for everyone, not just the Jews.<br>
He is standing in the outer area where everyone is allowed to be, and, whilst standing there, he declared,<br>
that His house is a house of prayer for all nations.  -- For all nations. -- He did not make this statement in the Jews-Only area.<br>
He said this in the area of the temple where everyone is allowed to be.<br>
<br>
By the way, when Jesus said that his house, his Temple is a house of prayer for all nations,<br>
The word, nations, was originally the Greek word that is pronounced, Eth-Naughs.<br>
It's why we have the English words, Ethnic, and, Ethnicity.<br>
<br>
If we think about what this Greek word means, and we insert those meanings into what Jesus said in the NLT,<br>
we can say that, Jesus called his Temple a house of prayer for all nations,<br>
all races, all people, all of the Jewish, and all of the Gentiles.<br>
The Gentiles were all of the people of all nations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 6:17 (KJV)<br>
But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 6: 16-18 NLT<br>
16 Don't you realise that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living.<br>
17 Thank God! Once you were slaves of sin, but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you.<br>
18 Now you are free from your slavery to sin, and you have become slaves to righteous living.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 16:17 (KJV)<br>
Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.<br>
<br>
Romans 16: 17-19 NLT<br>
...my dear brothers and sisters, watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people's faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught. Stay away from them.<br>
18 Such people are not serving Christ our Lord; they are serving their own personal interests. By smooth talk and glowing words they deceive innocent people.<br>
19 But everyone knows that you are obedient to the Lord....<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Read your Bible.  Why should I? Why do we have a Bible today?<br>
Why should we keep reading and studying our Bible every day?<br>
We read and study the Bible, because the Bible is here to help us learn. It is here for our learning.<br>
The Bible teaches us about God's promises that have been fulfilled, that are being fulfilled, and it teaches us about God's promises that are going to be fulfilled very soon.<br>
It exists for our learning.  Our Bible is here to teach us, to help us learn.<br>
The Bible gives us patience, it gives us comfort, it gives us encouragement, and it gives us hope.<br>
We are told all of this in Romans 15:4:<br>
<br>
Romans 15:4 (KJV)<br>
For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 15:4 (NLT)<br>
Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God's promises to be fulfilled.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4:16 (KJV)<br>
Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4:16 (NLT)<br>
16 Keep a close watch on how you live and on your teaching. Stay true to what is right for the sake of your own salvation and the salvation of those who hear you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 1:9 (KJV)<br>
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 1: 9 & 10 (NLT)<br>
An overseer, bishop, or church leader...must love what is good. He must live wisely and be just. He must live a devout and disciplined life.<br>
9 He must have a strong belief in the trustworthy message he was taught; then he will be able to encourage others with wholesome teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong.<br>
10 For there are many rebellious people who engage in useless talk and deceive others.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 John 1:10 (KJV)<br>
If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:<br>
<br>
We read the verse just before this one earlier in our study here.  Let's read it again in the NLT:<br>
<br>
2 John 1: 9-11 (NLT)<br>
9 Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God. But anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both the Father and the Son.<br>
10 If anyone comes to your meeting and does not teach the truth about Christ, don't invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement.<br>
11 Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:14 (KJV)<br>
That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4: 12-16 NLT<br>
...equip God's people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.<br>
13 This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.<br>
14 Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth.<br>
15 Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.<br>
16 He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 1:10 (KJV)<br>
For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 1: 3-17 NLT<br>
...stop those whose teaching is contrary to the truth.<br>
4 Don't let them waste their time in endless discussion of myths and spiritual pedigrees. These things only lead to meaningless speculations, which don't help people live a life of faith in God.<br>
<br>
(Don't let them waste their time in myths and endless genealogies, which cause speculation, which don't help people live a stewardship of God in faith.)<br>
<br>
5 The purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith.<br>
6 But some people have missed this whole point. They have turned away from these things and spend their time in meaningless discussions.<br>
7 They want to be known as teachers of the law of Moses, but they don't know what they are talking about, even though they speak so confidently.<br>
8 We know that the law is good when used correctly.<br>
9 For the law was not intended for people who do what is right. It is for people who are lawless and rebellious, who are ungodly and sinful, who consider nothing sacred and defile what is holy, who kill their father or mother or commit other murders.<br>
10 The law is for people who are sexually immoral, or who practice &#104;&#111;&#109;&#111;&#115;&#101;&#120;&#117;ality, or are (kidnappers,) slave traders, liars, promise breakers, or who do anything else that contradicts the wholesome teaching<br>
11 that comes from the glorious Good News entrusted to me by our blessed God.<br>
12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength to do his work. He considered me trustworthy and appointed me to serve him,<br>
13 even though I used to blaspheme the name of Christ. In my insolence, I persecuted his people. But God had mercy on me because I did it in ignorance and unbelief.<br>
14 Oh, how generous and gracious our Lord was! He filled me with the faith and love that come from Christ Jesus.<br>
15 This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it: "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners" -- and I am the worst of them all.<br>
16 But God had mercy on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example of his great patience with even the worst sinners. Then others will realise that they, too, can believe in him and receive eternal life.<br>
17 All honour and glory to God forever and ever! He is the eternal King, the unseen one who never dies; he alone is God. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4:6 (KJV)<br>
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4: 6-11 NLT<br>
6 If you explain these things to the brothers and sisters, Timothy, you will be a worthy servant of Christ Jesus, one who is nourished by the message of faith and the good teaching you have followed.<br>
7 Do not waste time arguing over godless ideas and old wives' tales. Instead, train yourself to be godly.<br>
8 "Physical training is good, but training for godliness is much better, promising benefits in this life and in the life to come."<br>
9 This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it.<br>
10 This is why we work hard and (continue to suffer, and) continue to struggle, for our hope is in the living God, who is the Saviour of all people and particularly of all believers.<br>
11 Teach these things and insist that everyone learn them.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Is your church keeping you stuck in kindergarten and First Grade, year after year?<br>
Is your church feeding you only breastmilk, year after year?<br>
Is it time for you to graduate, and go to the next level?<br>

<br>
Hebrews 6:1 (KJV)<br>
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 5:12-14, the end of Chapter 5, and then we keep reading into Hebrews chapter 6, to verse 3 -- KJV<br>
12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.<br>
13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.<br>
14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.<br>
1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,<br>
2 Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.<br>
3 And this will we do, if God permit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 5:12-14, the end of Chapter 5, and then we keep reading into Hebrews chapter 6, to verse 3 -- NLT<br>
12 You have been believers so long now that you ought to be teaching others. Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things about God's word.<br>
(you need someone to teach you again the basic things about the oracles of God.)<br>
<br>
You are like babies who need milk and cannot eat solid food.<br>
13 For someone who lives on milk is still an infant and doesn't know how to do what is right.<br>
14 Solid food is for those who are mature, who through training have the skill to recognise the difference between right and wrong.<br>
1 So let us stop going over the basic teachings about Christ again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding.<br>
<br>
(Surely we don't need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from dead works and placing our faith in God.)<br>
Surely we don't need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds and placing our faith in God.<br>
2 You don't need further instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.<br>
3 And so, God willing, we will move forward to further understanding.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 32:6 (KJV)<br>
For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the Lord, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 32: 1-8 NLT<br>
1<br>
Look, a righteous king is coming!<br>
And honest princes will rule under him.<br>
2<br>
Each one will be like a shelter from the wind<br>
and a refuge from the storm,<br>
like streams of water in the desert<br>
and the shadow of a great rock in a parched land.<br>
3<br>
Then everyone who has eyes will be able to see the truth,<br>
and everyone who has ears will be able to hear it.<br>
4<br>
Even the hotheads will be full of sense and understanding.<br>
Those who stammer will speak out plainly.<br>
5<br>
In that day ungodly fools will not be heroes.<br>
Scoundrels will not be respected.<br>
6<br>
For fools speak foolishness<br>
and make evil plans.<br>
They practice ungodliness<br>
and spread false teachings about the Lord.<br>
They deprive the hungry of food<br>
and give no water to the thirsty.<br>
7<br>
The smooth tricks of scoundrels are evil.<br>
They plot crooked schemes.<br>
They lie to convict the poor,<br>
even when the cause of the poor is just.<br>
8<br>
But generous people plan to do what is generous,<br>
and they stand firm in their generosity.<br>
<br>
We now conclude our study about Doctrine with this final passage in Colossians 2.<br>
Commentary: There are spiritual principles taught by Jesus Christ that are good and true,<br>
and there are spiritual principles of the world that are actually evil and false.<br>
Do you know the difference between orange juice and orange drinks?<br>
One is real and is made by God, the other is artificial and is made by man.<br>
You can buy an orange-flavoured drink that tastes exactly like orange juice,<br>
but actually has nought per cent juice (it actually has zero per cent juice).  It is just a bunch of man-made chemicals in a drink mix, with no actual juice at all.<br>
Just because it looks and tastes just like orange juice does not mean it is the real deal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 2: 6-10 (KJV)<br>
6 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:<br>
7 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.<br>
8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.<br>
9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<br>
10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:<br>
<br>
Colossians 2: 6-10 NLT<br>
6 And now, just as you accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord, you must continue to follow him.<br>
7 Let your roots grow down into him, and let your lives be built on him. Then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught, and you will overflow with thankfulness.<br>
8 Don't let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense that come from human thinking (and from the spiritual principles of this world,) and from the spiritual powers of this world, rather than from Christ.<br>
9 For in Christ lives all the fullness of God in a human body.<br>
(For in him dwells all the completeness of the Godhead bodily.)<br>
10 So you also are complete through your union with Christ, who is the head over every ruler and authority.<br>

"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" is a traditional African American spiritual,<br>
first published in 1927.<br>
It became an international pop hit in 1957–58 in a recording by English singer Laurie London,<br>
and has been recorded by many other singers and choirs.<br>

<br>

first published in 1927 and made popular in 1957.<br>

2 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.<br>
3 For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour....<br>

I have called you by name; you are mine.<br>

Let's take a look at a famous, old Christian song by Third Day, which is<br>
based on the NIV of Psalms 57, verse 10, and also the NIV of Psalms 36, verses 5 and 6.<br>
<br>
According to Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia,<br>
Third Day was a Christian rock band formed in Marietta, Georgia during the 1990s.<br>
The band was founded by lead singer Mac Powell, guitarist Mark Lee, and Billy Wilkins.<br>
They were active from 1991 to 2018.<br>
Third Day sold over 7 million albums in the United States and had 28 number one Christian album chart radio hits.<br>
<br>
One of their most famous and most popular songs, is titled,<br>
"Your Love Oh Lord (Psalm 36)"<br>
It was released on their third studio album, Time.<br>
Time is the third studio album from Christian rock band Third Day.<br>
It was released on 24 August 1999 by Essential Records.<br>
<br>
The album features ten songs chosen from more than 30 that<br>
the band had managed to write during their tour the previous year.<br>
Some of the songs left out can be heard in the album,<br>
Southern Tracks, which was released with limited copies of Time.<br>
<br>
This third album, Time, is also a return to the band's<br>
original southern rock roots, after their departure<br>
to a grungier style on their previous, second album.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 1999 song, "Your Love Oh Lord (Psalm 36)"<br>
from the band, Third Day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your love, oh Lord<br>
Reaches to the heavens<br>
Your faithfulness<br>
Stretches to the skies<br>
Your righteousness is<br>
Like the mighty mountain, yes<br>
Your justice flows like the ocean's tides<br>
<br>
<br>
I will lift my voice<br>
To worship You, my King<br>
And I will find my strength<br>
In the shadow of Your wings<br>
<br>
Your love oh Lord<br>
Reaches to the heavens<br>
Your faithfulness<br>
Stretches to the sky<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ruddy<br>
<br>
<br>
Red.<br>
We start with red, and then, end up as White.<br>
<br>
Other types of red...<br>
Crimson, a deep, dark red colour, or a deep purplish red colour.<br>
If you go crimson, your face becomes red because you are very angry or embarrassed<br>
<br>
Scarlet is bright red, a brilliant red colour.<br>
If you go scarlet, your face becomes red, usually because you are embarrassed or angry.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
This Bible study is basically about two colours, red and white.<br>
That's it.<br>
<br>
We are going to look for significant examples of red and white in the Bible.<br>
For red, we will need to also look for, crimson, Scarlet and Ruddy.<br>
<br>
Today, we might say that a ruddy face looks pink and healthy, with a healthy, rosy or pink colour, looking red and healthy.<br>
<br>
We will see here later on, a Bible verse in the Song of Solomon, where someone is described as being white and ruddy at the same time.<br>
<br>
Ruddy also means, red or even bloody.<br>
Ruddy mainly means, red or reddish.<br>
<br>
Crimson and Scarlet also basically refer to the red colour.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Red represents the old person that we used to be in the past, the imperfect, sinner.<br>
White is the new, forgiven and perfected, glorified person that we will become when we live forever in Heaven.  Our journey, basically, is just going from red, to white, where we walk away from the works of the flesh and we begin to show the works of the Spirit.  We go from walking in the flesh, to walking in the spirit, going from red, to white.  In this Bible study, we will look at names and verses that talk about red and white.<br>
<br>
This Bible study may leave us with some questions that we may not be able to clearly answer until we are in Heaven.  Here are some possible questions that may become apparent as we look at this study of red and white.  For example, we see the colour red in Esau and in David. Does this mean that they had red skin? Maybe it was some kind of dark, red skin. Perhaps, red hair as well? Maybe even Jesus had red skin or dark-red skin?  Maybe they just had some kind of dark skin?  The Bible does not really tell us. He was very red as he bled on the cross from the crown of thorns, and from being whipped with a kind of whip that sliced and tore open the skin on his back.  He later was resurrected and then later ascended up into heaven. The mount of transfiguration is the story where he became a dazzling, bright white colour. Let's now begin to look around for names and Bible verses that mention red, or white, and especially when the two are mentioned together, showing some kind of interaction or transformation, going from red to white.<br>
<br>
This first verse is the most obvious one that many of us were probably already thinking of...<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 1:18 (KJV)<br>
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 1:18 (NLT)<br>
"Come now, let's settle this," says the Lord. "Though your sins are like scarlet, I will make them as white as snow. Though they are red like crimson, I will make them as white as wool.<br>
<br>
Who turns your red into white? The Lord Jesus! Who makes your red become white? The Lord Jesus, Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
Did you know that there is a red worm mentioned in the Bible?<br>
It's known as a Crimson worm or Scarlet worm.<br>
There are three different ways how this worm is pronounced in the ancient Hebrew language.<br>
<br>
One way is, Toe-Law<br>
A second way would be, Toe-Lay-Ah<br>
And the third way is to say, Toe-Luh-eh<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 22: 1-8 KJV<br>
To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.<br>
1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?<br>
2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.<br>
3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.<br>
4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.<br>
5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<br>
6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.<br>
<br>
<br>
7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn:<br>
(they open out the lip, they shake the head,)<br>
they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,<br>
<br>
(He rolled himself on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he delight in him.)<br>
8 He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 22: 1-8 NLT<br>
For the choir director: A psalm of David, to be sung to the tune "Doe of the Dawn."<br>
1<br>
My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?<br>
Why are you so far away when I groan for help?<br>
2<br>
Every day I call to you, my God, but you do not answer.<br>
Every night I lift my voice, but I find no relief.<br>
3<br>
Yet you are holy,<br>
enthroned on the praises of Israel.<br>
4<br>
Our ancestors trusted in you,<br>
and you rescued them.<br>
5<br>
They cried out to you and were saved.<br>
They trusted in you and were never disgraced.<br>
6<br>
But I am a worm and not a man.<br>
I am scorned and despised by all!<br>
7<br>
Everyone who sees me mocks me.<br>
They sneer and shake their heads, saying,<br>
8<br>
"Is this the one who relies on the Lord?<br>
Then let the Lord save him!<br>
If the Lord loves him so much,<br>
let the Lord rescue him!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Right there in Psalm 22:6, the word for "worm" is  towla' or tola'ath.<br>

Back in 2011, Kid's Think & Believe Too was published bi-monthly by Alpha Omega Institute,<br>
which is in, Grand Junction, Colorado.<br>
This article is in the November-December 2011 issue,<br>
and is written by Lanny and Marilyn Johnson.<br>
I am now going to share with you this entire short article.<br>
The following text is from the Kid's Think & Believe Too,<br>
November-December 2011 issue.<br>
<br>
This article is about the<br>
Crimson worm or Scarlet worm<br>
<br>
Psalm 22 (sometimes called the Psalm of the Cross) is a great chapter of the Bible that tells about the suffering and death of Christ 1,000 years before he actually gave his life upon the cross.<br>
<br>
Verse 1 says, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? ..."<br>
In the gospels of Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34, Jesus cried out the same words whilst hanging on the cross. In verse 6 of Psalm 22, Jesus says something odd: "But I am a worm, and no man." What did he mean by saying "I am a worm"?<br>
<br>
Usually in the Bible, the Hebrew word for a worm is "rimmah", which means a maggot – but the Hebrew word Jesus used here for worm, is TOLA'ATH, which means "Crimson worm" or "Scarlet worm". Both scarlet and crimson are the colours of blood - deep red.<br>
<br>
The Crimson worm -- its scientific name is, coccus ilicis -- is a very special worm that looks more like a grub than a worm. When it is time for the female or mother Crimson worm to have babies (which she does only one time in her life), she finds the trunk of a tree, a wooden fencepost or a stick. She then attaches her body to that wood and makes a hard crimson shell. She is so strongly and permanently stuck to the wood that the shell can never be removed without tearing her body completely apart and killing her.<br>
<br>
The Crimson worm then lays her eggs under her body and the protective shell. When the baby worms (or larvae) hatch, they stay under the shell. Not only does the mother's body give protection for her babies, but it also provides them with food - the babies feed on the LIVING body of the mother!<br>
<br>
After just a few days, when the young worms grow to the point that they are able to take care of themselves, the mother dies. As the mother Crimson worm dies, she oozes a crimson or scarlet red dye which not only stains the wood she is attached to, but also her young children. They are coloured scarlet red for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>
After three days, the dead mother Crimson worm's body loses its crimson colour and turns into a white wax which falls to the ground like snow.<br>
<br>
So what did Jesus mean by saying "I am a worm"? There are a lot of ideas what Jesus might have meant, but nobody really knows for sure.<br>
However, it is very interesting that, just like the Crimson worm, Jesus sacrificed or gave up his life on a tree so that his children might be washed with his crimson blood and their sins cleaned white as snow.<br>
He died for us, that we might live through him!<br>
<br>
"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." Isaiah 1:18<br>
<br>
That is the end of that main article.<br>
It's interesting that, Jesus died, and three days later, he is risen from the grave.<br>
The red worm dies, and three days later it turns white and falls down, white, like snow.<br>
The red worm died so that her children can live.<br>
Jesus died so that we can live, forever.<br>
<br>
The article also has a side note that mentions some interesting facts about the Crimson Worm.<br>
<br>
Let's read it...<br>
<br>
The Crimson worm is common to the region of old Israel.<br>
<br>
They are round, about the size of a pea.<br>
Because they don't look like a worm, some people thought they were part of a plant.<br>
<br>
In ancient days, the dead bodies of the female Crimson worms were scraped from the tree, dried, and then ground into a powder that was used to dye their cloth and garments a scarlet or red colour.<br>
<br>
The crushed worm was also used to make medicine that helps the heart beat smoothly.<br>
<br>
The white wax body was used to make shellac, a preservative of wood.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look at a couple of names that have been associated with the colour, red.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look at the name, Esau.<br>
<br>
Genesis 25: 24 & 25 KJV<br>
24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.<br>
25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.<br>
<br>
Esau, means, "hairy"<br>
<br>
Genesis 25: 24-26 NLT<br>
24 And when the time came to give birth, Rebekah discovered that she did indeed have twins!<br>
25The first one was very red at birth and covered with thick hair like a fur coat. So they named him Esau.<br>
<br>
Esau sounds like a Hebrew term that means, Hair.<br>
<br>
26Then the other twin was born with his hand grasping Esau's heel. So they named him Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.<br>
<br>
Jacob sounds like the Hebrew words for, heel, and, deceiver.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 16: 10-14 KJV<br>
10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord hath not chosen these.<br>
<br>
11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: (for we will not sit round till he come hither,) for we will not sit down till he come hither.<br>
<br>
(And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal fair of eyes, and goodly to look to.)<br>
12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.<br>
<br>
13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.<br>
14 But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.<br>
(an evil spirit from the Lord terrified him.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 16: 10-14 NLT<br>
10 ...all seven of Jesse's sons were presented to Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, "The Lord has not chosen any of these."<br>
11<br>
Then Samuel asked, "Are these all the sons you have?"<br>
"There is still the youngest," Jesse replied. "But he's out in the fields watching the sheep and goats."<br>
"Send for him at once," Samuel said. "We will not sit down to eat until he arrives."<br>
12<br>
So Jesse sent for him. He was dark and handsome, with beautiful eyes.<br>
And the Lord said, "This is the one; anoint him."<br>
13 So as David stood there among his brothers, Samuel took the flask of olive oil he had brought and anointed David with the oil. And the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David from that day on. Then Samuel returned to Ramah.<br>
<br>
14 Now the Spirit of the Lord had left Saul, and the Lord sent (an evil spirit,) a tormenting spirit that filled him with depression and fear.<br>
<br>
<br>
After Samuel Anoints David as King<br>
David Serves in Saul's Court, playing the harp.<br>
<br>
Then, in the next chapter,<br>
1 Samuel 17<br>
This is the chapter where<br>
The Giant, Goliath, Challenges the Israelites.<br>
Jesse Sends David to Saul's Camp.<br>
Just before David Confronts Goliath, he does this, here in 1 Samuel 17.<br>
And then we see David again being described as being ruddy.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 17: 40-42 KJV<br>
40 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones (out of the valley,) out of the brook, and put them in (a shepherd's vessel,) a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.<br>
41 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.<br>
42 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 17: 40-43 NLT<br>
40 He picked up five smooth stones from a stream and put them into his shepherd's bag. Then, armed only with his shepherd's staff and sling, he started across the valley to fight the Philistine.<br>
41 Goliath walked out toward David with his shield bearer ahead of him,<br>
42 sneering in contempt at this ruddy-faced boy.<br>
43 "Am I a dog," he roared at David, "that you come at me with a stick?" And he cursed David by the names of his gods.<br>
<br>
King David had a son, Solomon, who became King Solomon.<br>
Was Solomon making a reference or a description of his dad as he wrote about this character in his Song of Solomon?<br>
<br>
Song of Solomon -- Song of Songs 5: 10-12 KJV<br>
(The Young Woman is describing her lover to the other Young Women of Jerusalem.)<br>
<br>
(My beloved is white and ruddy, a standard bearer among ten thousand.)<br>
10 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.<br>
<br>
11 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, (and curled,) and black as a raven.<br>
<br>
12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set (sitting in fulness, fitly placed, and set as a precious stone in the foil of a ring.)<br>

(The Young Woman is describing her lover to the other Young Women of Jerusalem.)<br>
10<br>
My lover is dark and dazzling,<br>
better than ten thousand others!<br>
11<br>
His head is finest gold,<br>
his wavy hair is black as a raven.<br>
12<br>
His eyes sparkle like doves<br>
beside springs of water;<br>
they are set like jewels<br>
washed in milk.<br>

Adam is not red.<br>
Aw-Dawm and Aw-Dam are two different words that sound similar.<br>
<br>
<br>
Add-Mo-Knee means red, ruddy (the description of Esau as an infant)<br>
Aw-Dam means red, as in a verb, to make something red, to make something become red<br>
Aw-Dawm is a masculine noun and is the Hebrew name of Adam.<br>
Aw-Dawm is man, human being, mankind, Adam, the first man, also a name of a city in the Jordan valley.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:19 (KJV)<br>
And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:19 (NLT)<br>
So the Lord God formed from the ground all the wild animals and all the birds of the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and the man chose a name for each one.<br>
<br>
Some parts of this study may seem to be a bit more advanced in its complexity.<br>
This study may make one come up with questions that we may not be able to have answered to until we get to heaven.<br>
<br>
Because of this, let's take a moment to think about a passage in 2 Peter 3.<br>
Pay special attention when you reach verses 15, 16 and 17.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3: 9-18 KJV<br>
9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.<br>
10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.<br>
11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,<br>
12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?<br>
13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.<br>
14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.<br>
15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;<br>
1 6As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.<br>
17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.<br>
18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3: 9-18 NLT<br>
9 The Lord isn't really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent.<br>
10 But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and the very elements themselves will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgement.<br>
(and the earth and everything on it will be burned up.)<br>
(and the earth and everything on it will be found destroyed.)<br>
<br>
11 Since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this, what holy and godly lives you should live,<br>
12 looking forward to the day of God and hurrying it along. On that day, he will set the heavens on fire, and the elements will melt away in the flames.<br>
13 But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world filled with God's righteousness.<br>
14 And so, dear friends, whilst you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.<br>
15 And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved. This is what our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom God gave him --<br>
16 speaking of these things in all of his letters. Some of his comments are hard to understand, and those who are ignorant and unstable have twisted his letters to mean something quite different, just as they do with other parts of Scripture. And this will result in their destruction.<br>
17 You already know these things, dear friends. So be on guard; then you will not be carried away by the errors of these wicked people and lose your own secure footing.<br>
18 Rather, you must grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<br>
All glory to him, both now and forever! Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As we finish up talking about red, let's think about this verse, one more time...<br>
Isaiah 1:18 (KJV)<br>
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br>
<br>
One last little note of one more thing that was red...<br>
<br>
After Jesus' Trial before Pilate, The Soldiers Mock Jesus...<br>
Matthew 27:28 (KJV)<br>
And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Since we were talking about going from red to white,<br>
let's now look at some verses that mention white.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 11:35 (KJV)<br>
And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.<br>
<br>
Daniel 11: 27-36 NLT<br>
27 Seeking nothing but each other's harm, these kings will plot against each other at the conference table, attempting to deceive each other. But it will make no difference, for the end will come at the appointed time.<br>
28 "The king of the north will then return home with great riches. On the way he will set himself against the people of the holy covenant, doing much damage before continuing his journey.<br>
29 "Then at the appointed time he will once again invade the south, but this time the result will be different.<br>
30 For warships (from Kittim) from western coastlands will scare him off, and he will withdraw and return home. But he will vent his anger against the people of the holy covenant and reward those who forsake the covenant.<br>
31 "His army will take over the Temple fortress, pollute the sanctuary, put a stop to the daily sacrifices, and set up the sacrilegious object that causes desecration (the abomination of desolation).<br>
32 He will flatter and win over those who have violated the covenant. But the people who know their God will be strong and will resist him.<br>
33 "Wise leaders will give instruction to many, but these teachers will die by fire and sword, or they will be jailed and robbed.<br>
34 During these persecutions, little help will arrive, and many who join them will not be sincere.<br>
35 And some of the wise will fall victim to persecution. In this way, they will be refined and cleansed and made pure until the time of the end, for the appointed time is still to come.<br>
36 "The king will do as he pleases, exalting himself and claiming to be greater than every god, even blaspheming the God of gods. He will succeed, but only until the time of wrath is completed. For what has been determined will surely take place.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 12:10 (KJV)<br>
Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 12: 3-13 NLT<br>
3 Those who are wise will shine as bright as the sky, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever.<br>
4 But you, Daniel, keep this prophecy a secret; seal up the book until the time of the end, when many will rush here and there, and knowledge will increase."<br>
5 Then I, Daniel, looked and saw two others standing on opposite banks of the river.<br>
6 One of them asked the man dressed in linen, who was now standing above the river, "How long will it be until these shocking events are over?"<br>
7 The man dressed in linen, who was standing above the river, raised both his hands toward heaven and took a solemn oath by the One who lives forever, saying, "It will go on for a time, times, and half a time. When the shattering of the holy people has finally come to an end, all these things will have happened."<br>
8 I heard what he said, but I did not understand what he meant. So I asked, "How will all this finally end, my lord?"<br>
9 But he said, "Go now, Daniel, for what I have said is kept secret and sealed until the time of the end.<br>
10 Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined by these trials. But the wicked will continue in their wickedness, and none of them will understand. Only those who are wise will know what it means.<br>
11 "From the time the daily sacrifice is stopped and (the abomination of desolation is set up to be worshiped, also known as) the sacrilegious object that causes desecration is set up to be worshiped, there will be 1,290 days.<br>
12 And blessed are those who wait and remain until the end of the 1,335 days!<br>
13 "As for you, go your way until the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days, you will rise again to receive the inheritance set aside for you."<br>
<br>
Commentary: That right there is the end of the book of Daniel, and it sure sounds like it would be in support of the post-trib argument.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 16:31 (KJV)<br>
And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.<br>
<br>
Exodus 16:31 (NLT)<br>
31The Israelites called the food manna. It was white like coriander seed, and it tasted like honey wafers.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for Manna, means, "What is it?"<br>
<br>
Here are some places in the New Testament where we see use of the colour, white.<br>
<br>
John 4:35 (KJV)<br>
Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.<br>
<br>
John 4: 34-38 NLT<br>
34 Then Jesus explained: "My nourishment comes from doing the will of God, who sent me, and from finishing his work.<br>
35 You know the saying, 'Four months between planting and harvest.' But I say, wake up and look around.<br>
<br>
(The fields are already white for harvest.)<br>
The fields are already ripe for harvest.<br>
<br>
36 The harvesters are paid good wages, and the fruit they harvest is people brought to eternal life. What joy awaits both the planter and the harvester alike!<br>
37 You know the saying, 'One plants and another harvests.' And it's true.<br>
38 I sent you to harvest where you didn't plant; others had already done the work, and now you will get to gather the harvest."<br>

2 Suddenly there was a great earthquake! For an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, rolled aside the stone, and sat on it.<br>
3 His face shone like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.<br>
4 The guards shook with fear when they saw him, and they fell into a dead faint.<br>
5 Then the angel spoke to the women. "Don't be afraid!" he said. "I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

4 But as they arrived, they looked up and saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled aside.<br>
5 When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side. The women were shocked,<br>
6 but the angel said, "Don't be alarmed. (You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene.) You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He isn't here! He is risen from the dead! Look, this is where they laid his body.<br>

13 "Dear woman, why are you crying?" the angels asked her.<br>
"Because they have taken away my Lord," she replied, "and I don't know where they have put him."<br>
<br>
<br>
The Ascension of Jesus<br>
(Acts of the Apostles 1:10) the book of Acts 1:10 (KJV)<br>
And whilst they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;<br>

11 "Men of Galilee," they said, "why are you standing here staring into heaven? Jesus has been taken from you into heaven, but someday he will return from heaven in the same way you saw him go!"<br>
<br>
The colour, white, is seen many times in the book of Revelation.<br>
We are just going to look at 12 examples here, in the book of Revelation.<br>
<br>
In Revelation 1, white is mentioned in verse 14.<br>
<br>
Revelation 1: 10-20 (KJV)<br>
10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,<br>
11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.<br>
12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;<br>
13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.<br>
14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;<br>
15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.<br>
16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.<br>
17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:<br>
18 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.<br>
19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;<br>
20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.<br>
<br>
(Son of Man is a title Jesus used for himself.)<br>
<br>
Revelation 1: 10-20 NLT<br>
10 It was the Lord's Day, and (I was worshiping in Spirit) I was worshiping in the Spirit. Suddenly, I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet blast.<br>
<br>
11 It said, "(Write on a scroll, or) Write in a book everything you see, and send it to the seven churches in the cities of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea."<br>
<br>
12 When I turned to see who was speaking to me, I saw seven gold lampstands.<br>
<br>
13 And standing in the middle of the lampstands was (someone like a Son of Man) someone like the Son of Man. He was wearing a long robe with a gold sash across his chest.<br>
<br>
14 His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow. And his eyes were like flames of fire.<br>
15 His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice thundered like mighty ocean waves.<br>
16 He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp two-edged sword came from his mouth. And his face was like the sun in all its brilliance.<br>
17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as if I were dead. But he laid his right hand on me and said, "Don't be afraid! I am the First and the Last.<br>
<br>
18 I am the living one. I died, but look -- I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and the grave (Hades).<br>
<br>
19 "Write down what you have seen -- both the things that are now happening and the things that will happen.<br>
(Write down what you have seen and what they mean -- the things that have already begun to happen.)<br>
<br>
<br>
20 This is the meaning of the mystery of the seven stars you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lampstands:<br>
<br>
(The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches,)<br>
The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 9:8 (KJV)<br>
Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.<br>
<br>
<br>

better than ten thousand others!<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 2:17 (KJV)<br>
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.<br>
<br>
Revelation 2:17 NLT<br>
17 "Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. To everyone who is victorious I will give some of the manna that has been hidden away in heaven. And I will give to each one a white stone, and on the stone will be engraved a new name that no one understands except the one who receives it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 3:5 (KJV)<br>
He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.<br>
<br>
Revelation 3: 4 & 5 NLT<br>
...They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.<br>
5All who are victorious will be clothed in white. I will never erase their names from the Book of Life, but I will announce before my Father and his angels that they are mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 4:4 (KJV)<br>
And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.<br>
<br>
Revelation 4: 1-6 NLT<br>
1 Then as I looked, I saw a door standing open in heaven, and the same voice I had heard before spoke to me like a trumpet blast. The voice said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after this."<br>
2 And instantly (I was in Spirit) I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne in heaven and someone sitting on it.<br>
3 The one sitting on the throne was as brilliant as gemstones -- like jasper and carnelian. And the glow of an emerald circled his throne like a rainbow.<br>
4 Twenty-four thrones surrounded him, and twenty-four elders sat on them. They were all clothed in white and had gold crowns on their heads.<br>
5 From the throne came flashes of lightning and the rumble of thunder. And in front of the throne were seven torches with burning flames.<br>
(They are the seven spirits.)<br>
This is the sevenfold Spirit of God.<br>
6 In front of the throne was a shiny sea of glass, sparkling like crystal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 6:2 (KJV)<br>
And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.<br>
<br>
Revelation 6: 1 & 2 NLT<br>
1 As I watched, the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals on the (book, or) scroll. Then I heard one of the four living beings say with a voice like thunder, "Come!"<br>
2 I looked up and saw a white horse standing there. Its rider carried a bow, and a crown was placed on his head. He rode out to win many battles and gain the victory.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 7:9-17 (KJV)<br>
9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;<br>
10 And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.<br>
11 And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,<br>
12 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?<br>
14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.<br>
15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.<br>
16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.<br>
17 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 7: 9-17 NLT<br>
9 After this I saw a vast crowd, too great to count, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing in front of the throne and before the Lamb. They were clothed in white robes and held palm branches in their hands.<br>
10<br>
And they were shouting with a great roar,<br>
"Salvation comes from our God who sits on the throne<br>
and from the Lamb!"<br>
11<br>
And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living beings. And they fell before the throne with their faces to the ground and worshiped God.<br>
12<br>
They sang,<br>
"Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom<br>
and thanksgiving and honour<br>
and power and strength belong to our God<br>
forever and ever! Amen."<br>
13 Then one of the twenty-four elders asked me, "Who are these who are clothed in white? Where did they come from?"<br>
<br>
<br>
14 And I said to him, "Sir, you are the one who knows."<br>
<br>
Then he said to me,<br>
(These are the ones who came out of the great suffering.)<br>
"These are the ones who died in the great tribulation. They have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb and made them white.<br>
<br>
<br>
15 "That is why they stand in front of God's throne<br>
and serve him day and night in his Temple.<br>
And he who sits on the throne<br>
will give them shelter.<br>
16 They will never again be hungry or thirsty;<br>
they will never be scorched by the heat of the sun.<br>
<br>
(For the Lamb on the centre of the throne will be their Shepherd.)<br>
17 For the Lamb on the throne<br>
will be their Shepherd.<br>
He will lead them to springs of life-giving water.<br>
And God will wipe every tear from their eyes."<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 14:14 (KJV)<br>
And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.<br>
<br>
Revelation 14: 12-14 NLT<br>
...God's holy people must endure persecution patiently, obeying his commands and maintaining their faith in Jesus.<br>
13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this down: Blessed are those who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, they are blessed indeed, for they will rest from their hard work; for their good deeds follow them!"<br>
14 Then I saw a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was (someone like a Son of Man) someone like the Son of Man. He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.<br>
<br>
(Son of Man is a title Jesus used for himself.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, we'll take a look at Revelation 19.<br>
Revelation 19 gives us Songs of Victory in Heaven, and it tells us about The Rider on the White Horse.<br>
There are three examples of white in Revelation 19.<br>
We will encounter them when we read through verse 8, verse 11, and verse 14.<br>
There are also references to things in here that can have a red colour.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 19: 4-16 (KJV)<br>
4 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.<br>
5 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.<br>
6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.<br>
7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.<br>
8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.<br>
9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.<br>
10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.<br>
11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.<br>
12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.<br>
13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.<br>
14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.<br>
15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.<br>
16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND Lord OF LORDS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 19: 4-16 (NLT)<br>
4 Then the twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshiped God, who was sitting on the throne. They cried out, "Amen! Praise the Lord!"<br>
5 And from the throne came a voice that said,<br>
"Praise our God,<br>
all his servants,<br>
all who fear him,<br>
from the least to the greatest."<br>
6 Then I heard again what sounded like the shout of a vast crowd or the roar of mighty ocean waves or the crash of loud thunder:<br>
"Praise the Lord!<br>
<br>
(For the Lord God, the Almighty, reigns.)<br>
For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.<br>
7 Let us be glad and rejoice,<br>
and let us give honour to him.<br>
For the time has come for the wedding feast of the Lamb,<br>
and his bride has prepared herself.<br>
8 She has been given the finest of pure white linen to wear."<br>
For the fine linen represents the good deeds of God's holy people.<br>
9 And the angel said to me, "Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb." And he added, "These are true words that come from God."<br>
<br>
10 Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said, "No, don't worship me. I am a servant of God, just like you and your brothers and sisters who testify about their faith in Jesus. Worship only God.<br>
<br>
(For the essence of prophecy is the message confirmed by Jesus.)<br>
For the essence of prophecy is to give a clear witness for Jesus."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11 Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. Its rider was named Faithful and True, for he judges fairly and wages a righteous war.<br>
12 His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself.<br>
13 He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title was the Word of God.<br>
14 The armies of heaven, dressed in the finest of pure white linen, followed him on white horses.<br>
15 From his mouth came a sharp sword to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He will release the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty, like juice flowing from a winepress.<br>
<br>
16 (On his robe and thigh,) On his robe at his thigh was written this title: King of all kings and Lord of all lords.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, what we saw just now, there in verse 7, about the bride, that should remind us that we are the Bride of Christ,<br>
and Christ is the Bridegroom.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 11:2 (NLT)<br>
...I promised you as a pure bride to one husband -- Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Our final example of the colour, white, is in Revelation 20.<br>
After The Thousand Years, Satan will be let out of his prison. We then read about The Defeat of Satan, and then we have The Final Judgement.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 20:11-14 (KJV)<br>
11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.<br>
12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.<br>
13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.<br>
14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<br>
15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 20:11-14 (NLT)<br>
11 And I saw a great white throne and the one sitting on it. The earth and sky fled from his presence, but they found no place to hide.<br>
12 I saw the dead, both great and small, standing before God's throne. And the books were opened, including the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to what they had done, as recorded in the books.<br>
13 The sea gave up its dead, and death and the grave (Hades) gave up their dead. And all were judged according to their deeds.<br>
14 Then death and the grave (Hades) were thrown into the lake of fire. This lake of fire is the second death.<br>
15 And anyone whose name was not found recorded in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire.<br>
<br>
This concludes our Ruddy study, our Bible study on red and white.<br>

Sometimes it feels like I'm breathing but am I alive<br>
I won't keep searching for answers that aren't here to find<br>
<br>
All I know is I'm not home yet<br>
This is not where I belong<br>
Take this world and give me Jesus<br>
This is not where I belong<br>
<br>
So when the walls come falling down on me<br>
And when I'm lost in the current of a raging sea<br>
I have this blessed assurance holding me.<br>
<br>
All I know is I'm not home yet<br>
This is not where I belong<br>
Take this world and give me Jesus<br>
This is not where I belong<br>
<br>
When the earth shakes I wanna be found in You<br>
When the lights fade I wanna be found in You<br>
<br>
All I know is I'm not home yet<br>
This is not where I belong<br>
Take this world and give me Jesus<br>
This is not where I belong<br>

<a name="JAH16WAYTRULIF"></a><h2>Way Truth Life</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Way Truth Life<br>
<br>
Here is a short, little Bible study that reminds us that the Bible is the way, the truth and the life.<br>
Commentary:<br>
the Bible is the way, the only way,<br>
The Bible is the truth, the only truth,<br>
and the Bible is the life, the only life that truly gives us life, forever.<br>
What kind of life should we be trying to live?  That life is the Bible, also known as the Torah.<br>
<br>
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- John 14:6 (KJV)<br>
<br>
Jesus told him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me. -- John 14:6 (NLT)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 1:14 KJV<br>
14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 1:14 NLT<br>
14<br>
So the Word became human (the Word became flesh) and made his home among us. He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness. (He was full of grace and truth.) And we have seen his glory, the glory of the Father's one and only Son.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Word of God, the Torah, the Law, The Law of the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, is the Way, The Truth and the Life.<br>
Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw, is The Torah.<br>
The Torah is The Way, The Torah is The Truth, The Torah is The Life<br>
<br>
The Torah is The Way...<br>
Psalms 119:1 KJV<br>
(Blessed are the perfect in the way)<br>
(Blessed are the sincere in the way)<br>
Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119: 1-10 NLT<br>
1<br>
Joyful are people of integrity,<br>
who follow the instructions of the Lord.<br>
2<br>
Joyful are those who obey his laws<br>
and search for him with all their hearts.<br>
3<br>
They do not compromise with evil,<br>
and they walk only in his paths.<br>
4<br>
You have charged us<br>
to keep your commandments carefully.<br>
5<br>
Oh, that my actions would consistently<br>
reflect your decrees!<br>
6<br>
Then I will not be ashamed<br>
when I compare my life with your commands.<br>
7<br>
As I learn your righteous regulations,<br>
I will thank you by living as I should!<br>
8<br>
I will obey your decrees.<br>
Please don’t give up on me!<br>
9<br>
How can a young person stay pure?<br>
By obeying your word.<br>
10<br>
I have tried hard to find you --<br>
don’t let me wander from your commands.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Torah is The Truth...<br>
Psalms 119: 142 & 143 KJV<br>
142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.<br>
<br>
(Trouble and anguish have found me: yet thy commandments are my delights.)<br>
143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119: 140-144 NLT<br>
140<br>
Your promises have been thoroughly tested;<br>
that is why I love them so much.<br>
141<br>
I am insignificant and despised,<br>
but I don’t forget your commandments.<br>
142<br>
Your justice is eternal,<br>
and your instructions are perfectly true.<br>
143<br>
As pressure and stress bear down on me,<br>
I find joy in your commands.<br>
144<br>
Your laws are always right;<br>
help me to understand them so I may live.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Torah is The Life, a fountain of Life<br>
Proverbs 13: 13 & 14 KJV<br>
13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.<br>
(he that feareth the commandment shall be in peace.)<br>
<br>
14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 13: 13 & 14 NLT<br>
13<br>
People who despise advice are asking for trouble;<br>
those who respect a command will succeed.<br>
14<br>
The instruction of the wise is like a life-giving fountain;<br>
those who accept it avoid the snares of death.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 19:7 KJV<br>
(The doctrine of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul:)<br>
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.<br>
<br>
Psalms 19:7 NLT<br>
7<br>
The instructions of the Lord are perfect,<br>
reviving the soul.<br>
The decrees of the Lord are trustworthy,<br>
making wise the simple.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4:2 KJV<br>
2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4:2 NLT<br>
2<br>
for I am giving you good guidance.<br>
Don’t turn away from my instructions.<br>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, the way, the truth, and the life, is also found in the Old Testament,<br>
in Psalms and Proverbs, because Jesus is the Old testament and the New Testament, Jesus is Torah.<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw is Torah, because Yaw-Who-Shaw is Yaw-Who-Wah.  Jesus is Lord God Almighty.<br>
Jesus Christ and God are both one and the same.<br>
Father God, the son Jesus and the Bible, Torah, are three in one, a trinity.<br>
The way, the truth, and the life, Trinity.<br>
Blood, water, spirit, Trinity.<br>
Father, son, holy ghost, trinity.<br>
Three in one. 1 times 1 times 1, equals 1.<br>

<a name="JAH16SUNGODOWN"></a><h2>Sunset Times</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sunset Times<br>
<br>
<br>
The Sabbath days of rest, and the required seven feasts of the Lord,<br>
all actually start on the day before, at sunset.<br>
<br>
Here are two websites that will tell you when the sun will set.<br>
The website simply needs for you to enter the name of the city that you are closest to.<br>
<br>
<br>
dateandtime.info -- Website will automatically first choose your city based on your IP Address until you select a different city<br>
<a href="https://dateandtime.info/citysunrisesunset.php">https://dateandtime.info/citysunrisesunset.php</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Maplogs Sunrise Sunset Times Lookup<br>
<a href="https://sunrise.maplogs.com/">https://sunrise.maplogs.com/</a><br>
<br>
<br>
If you can't determine the sunset by direct visual observation, because you are indoors or it is very foggy or cloudy outside,<br>
then it would be a good idea to use the two websites mentioned above to easily calculate the sunset time, based on the city that you are closest to.<br>
<br>
<br>
A long, complex mathematical formula is used to calculate the time of sunrise and sunset.<br>
Printing these times in a paper calendar is very inaccurate, because there can be, perhaps, as much as an hour difference between when the sun rises and sets in cities up north and in cities down south.<br>
And those differences will be different in summer than in winter.<br>
<br>
We will not even try to describe or explain the formula shown on the webpage,<br>
Sunrise equation, from Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_equation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_equation</a><br>
<br>
<br>
For example, during a day in July, let's compare two cities, both in the same time zone.<br>
Down in the south, we have Los Angeles, California,<br>
and then we compare that with Portland, Oregon, which is 961 miles north from there.<br>
The sunset time up north, in Portland, was about 49 or 50 minutes later, than in Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
If we do this comparison again on a day in winter, in mid-January,<br>
The sunset in Los Angeles is about 13 minutes later than in Portland.<br>
<br>
<br>
The difference between the shorter winter days and the longer summer days are more extreme as you go more towards the north.<br>

<br>
<br>
There was one day when I was thinking about this verse and the part at the end that says, sound mind.<br>
What is a sound mind?<br>
Let's look at the KJV, and then see what some other translations did with the end of that same verse.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 1:7 (KJV)<br>
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 1:7 -- New American Standard Bible (NASB)<br>
For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 1:7 (NLT)<br>
For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 1:7 (NIV)<br>
For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 1:7 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
For ELL-Low-Heem has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of self-control.<br>
<br>
Here is the KJV again...<br>
2 Timothy 1:7 (KJV)<br>
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at that last word there in the KJV, sound mind.<br>
<br>
The Greek word that was translated into, sound mind, is pronounced, So-Fran-EEs-Mass.<br>
Today, So-Fran-EEs-Mass, is a Greek word that means, correction.<br>
<br>
The Strong's Greek Lexicon, says it means<br>
self-control, self-discipline,<br>
calling to soundness of mind, to moderation and self-control.<br>
<br>
So, The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) translation also turned it into self control.<br>
<br>
The word, self-control, also reminds me of the NLT of the Fruit Of The Spirit list.<br>
Let's read the Fruit Of The Spirit list again.<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 22 & 23<br>
KJV: But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.<br>
NLT: But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!<br>
<br>
<br>
We are looking at the word, temperance, in the KJV, which became the word, self-control, in the NLT.<br>
<br>
This Greek word right there that was, temperance, or, self-control -- the original Greek word there is pronounced, Eh-Krah-Teh-Yah.<br>
Today, Eh-Krah-Teh-Yah is the Greek word that means, abstinence.<br>
<br>
The Strong's Greek Lexicon says that it means,<br>
self-mastery, self-restraint, self-control, continence, temperance<br>
the virtue of one who masters his desires and passions,<br>
especially his sensual appetites.<br>
<br>
This is one of the many things that the Holy Spirit does for us.<br>
May we be fully and completely filled with the Holy Spirit, and that we would not quench or limit or restrict or hinder the holy spirit, the spirit that is holy.<br>
In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>

<br>
43:2 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?<br>
43:3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.<br>

2<br>
For you are God, my only safe haven.<br>
Why have you tossed me aside?<br>
Why must I wander around in grief,<br>
oppressed by my enemies?<br>
3<br>
Send out your light and your truth;<br>
let them guide me.<br>
Let them lead me to your holy mountain,<br>
to the place where you live.<br>
4<br>
There I will go to the altar of God,<br>
to God -- the source of all my joy.<br>
I will praise you with my harp,<br>

<br>
All of Psalms 43 -- all five verses -- TS2009<br>
1<br>
Rule me rightly, O Elohim, And plead my cause against a nation without loving-commitment. Oh, deliver me from a man of deceit and unrighteousness!<br>
2<br>
For You are the Elohim of my strength. Why have You rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?<br>
3<br>
Send forth Your light and Your truth! Let them lead me, Let them bring me to Your set-apart mountain And to Your dwelling places.<br>
4<br>
That I might come to the slaughter-place of Elohim, To ELL, the joy of my delight, And praise You with the lyre, O Elohim, my Elohim.<br>
5<br>
Why are you depressed, O my being? And why are you restless within me? Wait for Elohim: for I shall yet thank Him, the deliverance of my face, And my Elohim.<br>
