<strong>Installing and Updating Windows 10 Without an Internet Connection</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Windows 10 builds are always released as International Standardization Organisation (ISO) disk image files.<br>
In Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise (not Windows 10 Home) you can double-click the ISO to "insert" the disk and view its contents.<br>
You can also right-click an ISO and burn the disk to DVD, Dual Layer DVD (DVD-DL) or CD, depending on its size.<br>
The Burn To Disk feature is not available in the Windows 10 Home edition.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Windows 10 Installer can be downloaded for free from Microsoft.<br>
You can download and use the installer for free, but it is the Product Key<br>
that you will need to purchase and activate.<br>
<br>
Most newer Windows devices have a Windows product key already memorised in the device's hardware.<br>
<br>

TOOL:&nbsp; Microsoft:&nbsp; English-Great Britain:&nbsp; Software Download:&nbsp; Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File)<br>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO/">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO/</a><br>
<br>
The problem with the above webpage is that the content and choices displayed are based on your computer or device.<br>
<br>
If you want to download the Windows 10 Installer as an ISO file,<br>
it will not offer that choice if the webpage sees that you are using Windows 10, or Windows 7 or 8.<br>
<br>
Here is how to download Microsoft's Windows 10 Installer as an ISO file whilst on a Windows 10 device.<br>
<br>
You will need to use your browser to trick the webpage into thinking that you are on a Mobile device, or that you are using an OS other than Windows 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you open the above link in a device running Windows 7, 8, or 10, the webpage will not offer the ISO file download and you will not see the direct download links of Windows 10 offline ISO files. <br>
You can also just visit the page on any mobile phone to display the ISO file options.<br>
<br>
On older versions of the Google Chrome web browser, you can right-click on a blank area of the webpage,<br>
and click on Inspect.<br>
The webpage is moved over into a frame on the left, and the HTML code is revealed on the right-side frames.<br>
The right frame has a menu that reads, Elements, Console, Sources, Network, and Performance.<br>
Just to the left of the word, Elements, is a small icon that shows a small rectangle.<br>
It's supposed to be an icon of a tablet, with a smaller mobile device on top of it.<br>
This icon is the Toggle Device Toolbar.<br>
You can hover over it to see this name.<br>
When you click on this icon, the webpage will think that you are a mobile device.<br>
Refresh the webpage to see the ISO file option.<br>
You can click on the X in the top right corner to close the right-frames.<br>
<br>
The download link is unique to your visit and is only valid for 24 hours.<br>
<br>
Here is another way, using Google Chrome.<br>
In this example, we will trick the website into thinking that your Operating System is something other than Windows.<br>
Please note that this may cause you to get a different edition of Windows, like, the Education Edition.<br>
That installer may install the Education Edition, instead of the Home or Professional Edition.<br>
<br>
Windows 10 Education is distributed through Academic Volume Licensing. <br>
It has fewer features than Windows 10 Enterprise.<br>
<br>
RFUT:&nbsp; Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:&nbsp; Windows 10 editions -- 12 Different Versions of Windows 10 (as of 2018)<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_editions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_editions</a><br>
<br>
<br>
To make the website think that you are using a different OS...<br>
Right-click on the page and select Inspect.<br>
<br>
Look for three dots in the top right corner, and below that, there are another three dots just to the left of the X.<br>
<br>
Click the second three-dotted menu button on the top-right, just to the left of the X (not the one above the X), and, under "More tools", select Network conditions.<br>
<br>
The Network Conditions tool details are now being displayed in the lower-right frame.<br>
<br>
Look down in the lower-right frame, where it says, User Agent.<br>
Under User agent, clear (untick) the Select automatically option.<br>
<br>
Select a different drop-down menu option, like the Safari - iPad iOS 9 option, from the User agent drop-down menu.<br>
<br>
The Safari browser is only made for the Mac OS. <br>
(They did try once to make a version for Windows years ago, but it never caught on and was abandoned.)<br>
<br>
After you switch the user agent on Chrome,<br>
<br>
Refresh the page if the browser doesn't reload automatically.<br>
<br>
Select the edition of Windows 10 you want.<br>
<br>
Click the Confirm button.<br>
<br>
Pick your product language from the drop-down menu.<br>
<br>
Click the Confirm button.<br>
<br>
Click the button to download the Windows 10 ISO to begin the process.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the 64-bit choice is displayed second (for mobile devices)<br>
and sometimes the 64-bit button is displayed first (for Safari browsers on Macs)<br>
<br>
</p><hr><p>
<br>
Microsoft Edge Browser<br>
<br>
Right-click on the webpage and select Inspect element.<br>
<br>

If you are building a machine and you do not want to connect it to the internet until the Windows Updates are installed first, there is a way to get and install all of the Windows Updates up through last month without an Internet connection.<br>
<br>
<br>
Windows Updates are also available in an all-inclusive installer.<br>
The installer will install all major updates up through the month indicated.<br>
<br>
More precisely, the Cumulative Update app has all of the updates up through the third week of the month it was released.<br>
Updates that are more than three weeks into the current month will be included on next month's Cumulative Update app.<br>
<br>
Each month, a new Cumulative Update app is created for Windows 10.<br>
The title has the format of YYYY-MM each month.<br>
<br>
Do a search using syntax as shown below.<br>
<br>
<br>
Microsoft prefers to mention the year first, followed by the month.<br>
<br>
The syntax is<br>
Windows (build number YYMM) (year) (hyphen) (month) and the words, Cumulative Update<br>
<br>
Example<br>
Windows 1703 YYYY-MM Cumulative Update<br>
<br>
To do a search for the Cumulative Update for August 2017:<br>
Windows 1703 2017-08 Cumulative Update<br>
<br>
That would have all updates up through August 2017, for Windows 10 Build 1703, which is the build that was released in 2017, March.<br>
<br>
If you did a search using the above line,<br>
you would find the installer that is the Cumulative Update for Windows 10, Build 1703 (build released in 2017 March) Updater that has all updates through 2017 August (2017-08).<br>
<br>
If you want to know what build or version you have, navigate to this About Windows app and launch it:<br>
<br>
C:\Windows\System32\winver.exe<br>
<br>
The version number is the build number (not the OS build number shown inside the round brackets).<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Windows 10 Generic Product Keys</h3>
<p>They are also known as default product keys, since they are first installed by default until a unique key is entered.<br>
Default keys, published publically by Microsoft (see link below), are only used to assist with installation, and cannot be used for activation.<br />
<br>
Key Management Server (KMS) generic keys.&nbsp; Hosts activated via a KMS have to report back to that key server once every 180 days.<br>
<br>
The product keys below are also published on many other websites, including the following Microsoft website:<br>

<p align="left" width="100%">
<br>

<p>
<br>
</p>
<h2>Windows 10 System Requirements</h2><p>
<br>
Generally, a machine that is running Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 can also run Windows 10.<br>
There are also some machines that ran Windows XP that could also qualify for running Windows 10.<br>
<br>
Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 can be upgraded without having to erase and install Windows 10 from scratch.<br>
<br>
Windows 10 System Requirements<br>
Processor:<br>
1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or System on Chip (SoC)<br>
<br>
RAM:<br>
1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit<br>
<br>
Minimum Hard Disk Space:<br>
16 GB for 32-bit OS, or 20 GB for 64-bit OS<br>
<br>
Graphics card:<br>
DirectX 9 or later with Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.0 driver<br>
<br>
Display:<br>
800x600<br>
<br>
Personal advice:&nbsp; As of 2017, 1 single processor will work, but very slowly. Avoid using a machine with only one single processor.<br>
2 processors are tolerable.&nbsp; 4 processors would be acceptable.  <br>
1 gigahertz (GHz) processor speed is a bit slow, but acceptable.&nbsp; Go after a faster speed.&nbsp; Above 2 GHz is good, and above 3 GHz is very good.<br>
Most machines are 64-bit.&nbsp; Avoid 32-bit machines, since some software is no longer made for 32-bit.<br>
There used to be some 64-bit machines that only ran 32-bit software, because the hardware drivers were only released in 32-bit.&nbsp; Mind out for those devices, and avoid them.<br>
For 64-bit, 2 GB of RAM will work, but 4 GB or more is better.<br>
For Hard Drives, 20 GB is the minimum for 64-bit Windows 10.<br>
However, based on the amount of typical apps that one would install, and the typically-expected amount of personal file accumulation that could be found on a hard drive,<br>
it is personally recommended that the hard drive be no less than 128 GB.<br>
128 Gigabytes (GB) = 131072 Megabytes (MB)<br>
If you are going to buy a Windows device, and there is not at least 128 GB of hard disk capacity, I would advise you not to purchase it.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br />
<strong>Booting Up to a CD or DVD in Windows 8.1 OEM Builds -- Disable Secure Boot</strong><br />
<br />
The steps and procedures very, depending on the manufacturer.<br />
Usually there is a certain Function Key to press that will change the boot order or choose the optical drive or CD/DVD drive as the device to boot from.<br />
<br />
Another way is to go into the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS).&nbsp; Note that the BIOS technology is changing and is being replaced with new technology, like, for example, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) which supports Secure Boot, so these instructions may already be obsolete for new machines, as BIOS fades away and is replaced with UEFI.<br />
The way to get into the BIOS varies.&nbsp; It also usually involves repeatedly pressing a certain Function Key (F-Key, F1 through F9 on the keyboard.)&nbsp; Some keys typically used to boot into the BIOS are F1, F2, F12, or Escape (Esc).<br />
Once at the BIOS menu, usually, you use only the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to select or make changes, and the Escape (Esc) key go back out or Cancel.<br />
In most cases, navigate to System Configuration (or something with a similar name) and look for Boot Options, where you can control which devices are allowed to boot the machine, and in which sequence they will be examined for possible booting software.<br />
Make sure CD-ROM Boot, or CD/DVD boot, or sometihng to that effect, is Enabled.&nbsp; If there is an order that the devices are in, change the order so that the optical drive is examined first.&nbsp; Look across the bottom of the BIOS screen for instructions on how to select and move devices up and down the list.&nbsp; The machine will start at the top of the list and look at that device to see if it has boot software.&nbsp; If the drive is empty or does not contain bootable software, like some sort of bootable operating system, it will go to the next device in the list and see if it has an operating system that it can boot from.&nbsp;<br /> 
<br />
While in this area, look for an option called "Secure Boot."&nbsp; If you are not able to get your bootable DVD or bootable CD to run and boot up, you may need to Disable Secure Boot.&nbsp; Only newer machines have this option, and where you can enable and disable Secure Boot in the BIOS will vary.&nbsp; If you do need to disable Secure Boot, you may also need to tell Windows that it is disabled as well.<br />
Try to see if you can boot from DVD or CD while keeping Secure Boot on. If bootup by CD/DVD still does not work, then go into BIOS and Disable Secure Boot.<br />
There also may be circumstances where you need to disable Secure Boot in order to install a graphics card, some hardware, or other operating system that’s not compatible with Secure Boot.<br />
<br />
Secure Boot helps to make sure that your PC boots using only firmware that is trusted by the manufacturer.&nbsp; Secure Boot is a security standard developed by members of the PC industry to help make sure that your PC boots using only software that is trusted by the PC manufacturer.<br />
When the PC starts, the firmware checks the signature of each piece of boot software, including firmware drivers (Option ROMs) and the operating system. If the signatures are good, the PC boots, and the firmware gives control to the operating system.<br />
For most PCs, you can disable Secure Boot through the PC's firmware (BIOS) menus, as mentioned previously. For logo-certified Windows RT 8.1 and Windows RT PCs, Secure Boot is required to be configured so that it cannot be disabled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another way to Disable Secure Boot is to do it from Windows, rather from inside the BIOS.<br />
After windows starts up and is running, hold the Shift key while selecting Restart. Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced Options: UEFI Firmware Settings.<br />
Find the Secure Boot setting, and if possible, set it to Disabled. This option is usually in either the Security tab, the Boot tab, or the Authentication tab.<br />
Save changes and exit. The PC reboots.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you see a "SecureBoot isn't configured correctly" watermark in the lower-right corner of the desktop, a Windows Update has been released that will fix that and remove the watermark. In that case, run the Windows Update Control Panel.<br />
<br />
Many technicians are also taking their bootable software and installing it on a USB stick (thumb drive), so that they can boot from a USB stick.&nbsp; It is possible to boot up the Windows Installer and install Windows with a USB stick, instead of a DVD.&nbsp; Many new tablets and devices do not come with an optical drive, so the bootable USB stick is a popular way to install Windows.<br />
<br />
The instructions above on how to go about booting from an optical drive also should work if you want to make a USB stick (flash drive or thumb drive) be a bootable device.&nbsp; Just select the option for USB instead of the option for an optical drive in the instructions above.&nbsp; The remaining information applies only to those running Windows RT.<br />
<br />
Booting up a Windows RT device using an optical drive or USB has been made to be intentionally impossible for regular users, yet some technicians are starting to report that there may be some situations where Booting by USB stick and turning off Secure Boot may be possible in Windows RT in some rare situations, although it is intentionally supposed to be impossible to do.<br />
<br />
There may be three possible ways to do this:<br />
Volume Down + Power Button&nbsp; or<br />
Volume Up + Power Button&nbsp; or<br />
Volume Up + Windows Key on Tablet<br />
<br />
Again, one of the three possible ways to boot up a machine to a USB stick, running Windows RT, on some machines, is to hold down the volume down while powering on. <br />
<br />
On other models, you hold "Volume Up" and the Windows key on the tablet itself (not the keyboard Windows key).<br />
<br />
A third way may be to press and hold both the hardware Volume Up button (usually on the left side of the RT device) and press the Power button (usually on the top). Then, release the Volume Up button. <br />
<br />
Another way from within Windows, is to go to the Charms Bar on the right, Settings, Change PC Settings, and then navigate to Update and Recovery, then Recovery. Then, tap the Restart button under Advanced Startup, and when the system reboots into the Recovery environment, choose Troubleshoot, Advanced Options, and then UEFI Firmware Settings. Then, tap Restart.<br />
<br />
Some of the options you may find in the UEFI firmware interface:<br />
<br />
Delete All Secure Boot Keys. If you select this option and then Yes, Secure Boot will be changed from the usual User mode to Setup mode. In this mode, Secure Boot is disabled and the option changes to Install All Factory Default Keys. Select that and then choose between "Windows & 3rd party UEFI CA [certificate authorities] (Default)" and "Windows only."<br />
<br />
Configure External Ports. If you choose this option, you'll be presented with a pop-up menu with the following choices: All ports enabled (the default), Enable USB & microSD/Disable Docking Port, Enable Docking Port/Disable USB & microSD, and All ports disabled.<br />
<br />
Device Information. If you choose this option, you'll be presented with a pop-up that displays your Surface Pro 3's System UUID (universally unique identifier) and serial number, both of which are used to uniquely identify your device.<br />

Instructions on how to improve and control the performance of your Windows 10 machine.<br>
<br>
These instructions will help you...<br>
<br>
-- Protect Your Privacy<br>
-- Prevent Automatic Software Downloads and Installs<br>
-- Stop Transmission of your personal information and computer activities<br>
-- Stop the automatic placement of advertisements being inserted into your operating system.<br>
<br>
<br>
About every 6 months, a newer build of Windows 10 is released and sent automatically to all Windows 10 machines using Windows Update.<br>
Some of these instructions were based on older builds. <br>
In newer builds, registry keys that did not exist a year or two ago may now already exist.<br>
If the steps below ask you to create a key that already exists, it is because the newer Windows 10 builds now include that key by default.<br>
It is good to observe the instructions below and at least check the key names, locations, and the value (1 or 0) being stored in the key, even if they now exist already by default.<br>
Also, the exact wording, names and locations of preferences and settings may change in newer builds.<br>
If these instructions don't quite match what you see in your newer build, you will have to figure out what the new name is, and where it may have been moved to.<br>
Some settings may also be adjusted by default in newer builds.<br>
Some items that used to be turned off by default may now be turned on by default, and what would have previously been on in an older build may now be found to be off by default in the newer build.<br>
<br>
The build number refers to the year and month when that version of the software was finished.<br>
Build number is a 2-digit year, followed by a 2-digit month when the code was considered finished.<br>
The finished build is usually not released until the following month.<br>
<br>
<br>
Traditionally, new builds were released about every six months.<br>
The builds would be finished in March and September,<br>
and then released near the end of April and October.<br>
<br>
<br>
As of April 2020, there were nine  Windows 10 builds released.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

SPECIAL NOTE:<br>
Build 1703 is a build that you should keep, so that you can install Windows 10 on older machines.<br>
Build 1703 was the last build that included the older hardware drivers for older computers.<br>
If you are trying to install Windows 10 on an older computer, and the installer can't run, or it can't find the hard drives,<br>
then you may need to install Build 1703 first, and then upgrade to the newer build after that.<br>
When the newer build is done, the older Build 1703 will be in moved into a <br>
folder that is usually called, Windows.old .<br>
<br>
How to delete the Windows.old folder:<br>
Open Windows Settings.<br>
Click on System.<br>
In left column, click on Storage.<br>
In right column, click on<br>
Configure Storage Sense or run it now<br>
Down where it says, Free up space now<br>
Tick, Delete previous versions of Windows<br>
Click the Clean now button<br>
and it will start cleaning up files.<br>
Observe the message at the bottom.<br>
Wait for a few minutes.<br>
<br>
The folder with the previous installation<br>
of Windows 10 will no longer be available on your device.<br>

Do not copy or install any apps until the anti-virus is configured.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Check your Windows 10 edition first.<br>
Product keys are permanently loaded into the hardware before it leaves the factory.<br>
Those product keys may force you to install an edition that you do not want.<br>
<br>
If you want Pro and the product key in the hardware is forcing you to be Home edition,<br>
grab the generic, default pro key below and change it to that.<br>
You can change the edition to pro, but you cannot activate the pro with a generic, default key.<br>
<br>
You will need to buy it, and then change the default pro key to your purchased pro key.<br>
The keys below are only good for the installation and cannot be used for activation or permanent use.<br>
These keys were originally published to the general public by Microsoft.<br>

<strong>Stop Windows Security From Automatically Deleting Files</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
If you are planning to continue running Windows Security, here is how to<br>
Stop Windows Security from automatically deleting files.<br>
Please read this carefully, as some of the wording may vary,<br>
depending on how new or how old your Windows 11 build may be.<br>
<br>
Go to Windows Security , Virus & threat protection<br>
Under Virus & threat protection settings, click Manage settings<br>
Under Exclusions, click Add or remove exclusions<br>
Click, Add an exclusion, and choose File or Folder<br>
You may this way exclude the download folder, or exclude an executable, or whatever folder or app you choose.<br>
<br>
antivirus is deleting an exe file as soon as it's downloaded. So how can I prevent from deleting a file<br>
<br>
after downloading add an exclusion for downloaded .EXE.<br>
If file is already downloaded and deleted then you can restore it and set as exclusion<br>
<br>
If an item was quarantined, here is how to get it back...<br>
<br>
Open Windows Security.<br>
Select Virus & threat protection and then click Protection history.<br>
In the list of all recent items, filter on Quarantined Items.<br>
Select an item you want to keep, and take an action, such as restore.<br>
<br>
Open the Local Group Policy Editor.<br>
<br>
In the left pane of Local Group Policy Editor, navigate to the location below.<br>
<br>
Computer Configuration , Administrative Templates , Windows Components ,<br>
Windows Security , Notifications<br>
<br>
<br>
on the right, double-click on each and Disable so they are not hidden.<br>
<br>
Hide non-critical notifications<br>
Hide all notifications<br>
<br>
To configure potentially unwanted app blocking go to<br>
Windows Security ,<br>
App & browser control , Reputation-based protection settings.<br>
<br>
There you'll find a control that lets you turn potentially unwanted app blocking on or off<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Open Settings app. (in Windows 11)<br>
Select Privacy & Security category and select "For developers"<br>
to enable installing apps not from Windows Store<br>
Turn On Developer Mode -- Install apps from any source, including loose files.<br>
Turn on developer mode? Yes.<br>

<h2>Disable Windows Update and Data Collection (Telemetry/Keylogging) in Windows 10, and get Windows Photo Viewer working in Windows 10</h2>
<p>
Remember that there are at least 4 or 5 different ways to do things in Windows.<br>
These steps show one way.&nbsp; It may not be the best or fastest way, but these steps will work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Make a shortcut of this on your desktop and always empty and delete its contents before shutting down or restarting:<br />
C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp<br />
<br>

<br>
<br>
Restart the computer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Come back to this area to continue with the additional instructions below.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We are done with the anti-virus.<br>
You may now copy and install apps onto the machine.<br>
Go ahead and install Office, then<br>
activate Windows and Office.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Check Privacy Settings</h2>
<p>
<br>
To make sure your privacy is well-protected, go to Settings, Privacy,<br>
Click each item in the left column, then switch off each item in the right column.<br>
Remember to scroll the columns up and down, as additional items at the top and bottom<br>
may not be visible until you scroll up and down.<br>
Again, scroll left column up and down, and<br>
scroll right column up and down with each left-column selection.<br>
NOTE: Each right column may have a Change button.<br>
You need to click on the Change button each time, to turn things off.<br>
There are many items and many Change buttons.<br>
This will take several minutes to do.<br>
<br>
For example, one item in the left column is, Background Apps.<br>
<br>
Background Apps will Turn off Windows apps running in the background.<br>
<br>
In Settings, Privacy, and scroll the left column down to Background Apps<br>
<br>
this will stop Skype from running all the time, along with other apps.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
launch this app<br>
Registry Editor app (regedt32.exe)<br>
C:\Windows\System32\regedt32.exe<br>
<br>
Right-click and run as admin.<br>
<br>
Navigate to here<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection<br>
Right-click on DataCollection yellow folder key, and select, New, DWORD (32-bit) Value.<br>
give it the name, AllowTelemetry and let it be kept at the default value of 0.<br>
Close the Registry Editor app.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
next, locate this app<br>
the name of this app is, Windows Compatibility Telemetry.<br>
C:\Windows\System32\Compattelrunner.exe<br>
right click on Compattelrunner.exe<br>
Properties , Security , Advanced.<br>
Change Owner to your account -- Your user name.<br>
Apply this change.  Since we have done this twice already, we may skip some of the exact steps in here.<br>
<br>
Back at the Properties window, up in the list of accounts, Choose your account in the list and click Edit.<br>
Here, put a checkmark on Full Control and click Apply.<br>
Delete Compattelrunner.exe from its folder, the right-click on the Recycle Bin and select Empty the Recycle Bin afterward.<br>
<br>
<br>
Launch Task Scheduler to disable the process<br>
C:\Windows\System32\taskschd.msc<br>
Right click and Run as Administrator.<br>
Look at the navigation panel on the left and expand these folders --<br>
Task Scheduler Library, then expand Microsoft, then Windows, and finally Application Experience.<br>
Right-click on the following programs and Disable them:<br>
AITAgent, Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser, ProgramDataUpdater.<br>
<br>
Here are the older instructions for older builds...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Disable Windows 10 Telemetry (Continued)<br>
<br>
<br>
Task Manager, Services tab, right-click anywhere in that list and Open Services.<br>
Wait about 5 seconds.<br>
Services (services.msc)<br>
For each item mentioned below, find it in the list,<br>
right-click on the item, Properties, make sure it is stopped and disabled.<br>
Do these steps with each item listed below.<br>
Now you need to disable the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
Connected User Experiences and Telemetry Service<br>
***NOTE: We just deleted this service.<br>
Therefore, you will get a series of error messages, and then the service will<br>
disappear from the Services list.<br>
<br>
<br>
Auto Time Zone Updater (changes your time zone based on your IP address)<br>
This is now disabled by default.<br>
<br>
dmwappushsvc (WAP Push Message Routing Service)<br>
*** This may no longer exist; it used to be in older builds.<br>
<br>
Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry (CompatTelRunner.exe)<br>
***NOTE: Look for it, and it should no longer be in the list.<br>
We just deleted this service.<br>
The attempt to disable the other similar service above<br>
should have also caused this servcie to disappear from the Services list.<br>
<br>
<br>
Windows Update (unless you want to run it)<br>
<br>
Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service<br>
if it is running and you can't stop it,<br>
<br>
Go to Task Manager, and in the Processes folder, scroll way, way down,<br>
scroll down to Service Host: Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service<br>
Right-click, End Task, and you will see a warning message with a tickbox.<br>
put a tick in the tickbox, and click OK (or the button on the right).<br>
Go back to the Services list and try again.  Make sure it is Disabled and not running.<br>
<br>
Additional items to Stop and Disable in Services:<br>
Data Sharing Service<br>
Geolocation Service<br>
Microsoft Store Install Service -- InstallService<br>
Payments and NFC/SE Manager -- SEMgrSvc<br>
Remote Access Auto Connection Manager -- RasAuto<br>
Remote Access Connection Manager -- RasMan<br>
Remote Desktop Configuration -- SessionEnv<br>
Remote Desktop Services -- TermService<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
---come back here after installing Adobe apps to disable...<br>
Adobe Acrobat Update Service (AdobeARMservice)<br>
Adobe Genuine Software Integrity Service<br>
AdobeUpdateService<br>
<br>
If you can't disable them using the steps above,<br>
then you can find the same Services in the Registry below<br>
and disable them in the Registry, using the steps below.<br>
<br>
If we're all done with disabling Services here,<br>
we can now close the Services window.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p><hr><p>
<br>
Another way to make changes to the Services is to<br>
do it directly inside the Registry.<br>
Some Registry keys did not allow changes to be made.<br>
Here is a way to get around that.<br>
<br>
Again, launch this app -- Right-click and run as admin.<br>
Registry Editor app (regedt32.exe)<br>
C:\Windows\System32\regedt32.exe<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Navigate to here<br>
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<br>
<br>
Here is the same list of Services in the Registry<br>
They are listed by file name, NOT by title.<br>
We have some titles listed below, followed by the actual file name to search for.<br>
For each file name listed below, find it and click on the yellow folder to see<br>
the values stored inside, displayed in the right column.<br>
In each key (yellow folder), find the value (in right column) titled, Start,<br>
and change is Data value to 4.<br>
The value of 4 is Disabled, setting the Service to disabled.<br>
<br>
<br>
Agent Activation Runtime_32ee1 -- file name: AarSvc_32ee1<br>
Windows Defender Antivirus Service -- WinDefend<br>
Windows Update Medic Service -- WaaSMedicSvc<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We did a very similar thing earlier in the System Settings.<br>
To prevent remote use of this computer, clear the checkboxes on the Remote tab<br>
of the System properties control panel item. Here's how...<br>
go to control panel,<br>
System control panel, in left column, click on Remote settings.<br>
First, click on the Advanced button.<br>
Untick -- Allow this computer to be controlled remotely<br>
Click OK<br>
and back at the previous Properties window,<br>
Untick -- Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer<br>
and make sure the lower section adio button is set to<br>
Don't allow remote connections to this computer.<br>
Click Apply, OK.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
After installing PrivateFirewall...<br>
<br>
<br>
Several apps to consider listing and blocking in PrivateFirewall are listed below...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\AdobeGCClient<br>
in there is an app called<br>
AGSService.exe<br>
<br>
Its name is,<br>

Office Subscription Licensing Heartbeat<br>
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE16\OLicenseHeartbeat.exe<br>
<br>
Office Telemetry Agent<br>
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\msoia.exe<br>
<br>
<br>
Disk Space Clean-up Manager for Windows -- c:\windows\system32\cleanmgr.exe<br>
cleanmgr.exe is the app that keeps making the DISM apps in the Temp folder.<br>
C:\Windows\System32\cleanmgr.exe<br>
Block that app from running to stop the DISM apps from constantly being created, installed and ran.<br>
<br>
<br>
FYI: Point PrivateFirewall to the following hidden app and use PrivateFirewall to make it not run.<br>
the name of the app is<br>
Windows Update Client API Host<br>
<br>
Use PrivateFirewall to disable this so that it does not run<br>
(This is an invisible System app)<br>
c:\windows\system32\wuapihost.exe<br>
<br>
And also use the Sordum Windows Update Blocker app mentioned previously<br>
to keep Windows Update Off.<br>
The link to the Sordum Windows Update Blocker is below, then continue reading for more apps to add into PrivateFirewall.<br>
You should have already applied this protection by now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
continue by adding the following apps into the PrivateFirewall list...<br>
Windows Modules Installer -- TrustedInstaller.exe<br>
C:\Windows\servicing\TrustedInstaller.exe<br>
Change Owner to yourself<br>
then edit all permissions for all users so that they can only read,<br>
but they cannot read and execute.<br>
Otherwise, this app will launch every few minutes when there is an Internet connection.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Windows Modules Installer Worker app (TiWorker.exe)<br>
is inside this directory:<br>
C:\Windows\WinSxS -- the actual, full path varies by device and Windows build number.<br>
An example of where it could be found on a machine with an AMD 64 bit processor...<br>
C:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-servicingstack_(several unique characters based on your device and Windows build number)......\TiWorker.exe<br>

<p><span style="font-size: large"><i><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Editing&nbsp; the &nbsp;Boot-Up&nbsp; Descriptions</span></b></i></span></p>
<p>This is how to change the boot descriptions on a multi-boot machine, where you have to choose an operating system during startup.</p>
<p>On a multi-boot machine, if the description of each boot option is unclear, here is how to change it:</p>
<p>1. Start your multi-boot computer, and when the choices of operating systems appear, choose one of the boot options from the boot menu.</p>
<p>The boot option that you select during startup will be the one that will have its boot-up description edited.</p>
<p>After startup completes, make a note of which Windows installation is running.</p>
<p><br />
2. Run As Administrator the Command Prompt (cmd.exe)</p>
<p>3. Type the following command: bcdedit /set description &quot;Menu description goes here&quot; <br />
Put inside the quotes your own description for the boot description text, and be sure to include the quotation marks in your command. Press Enter.</p>
<p>4. Restart your computer, and note that the menu description you just entered now appears on the menu. Select the other boot menu option.</p>
<p>5. Repeat steps 2 and 3, again adding a menu description to replace the generic text in order to make the boot description more unique and meaningful.</p>
