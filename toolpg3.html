WiFi Password Recovery<br>
<br>
Tell your Windows 11 computer to display<br>
the WiFi password that it has remembered<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is how to display the WiFi password of any available network saved on your computer.<br>
If you ever connected to a WiFi network but forgot the password,<br>
run Command Prompt as administrator.<br>
Right-click on Command Prompt and choose, Run as administrator.<br>
Command Prompt is found here...<br>
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe<br>
<br>
Execute this command...<br>
<br>
netsh wlan show profile<br>
<br>
Hit Enter. This will list all the WiFi network profiles<br>
that the PC has ever been connected to.<br>
<br>
Find the profile name in the list that you need the password for.<br>
Once you know the profile name, insert that name into the command below.<br>
Remove the round brackets below and put that name in that spot below<br>
<br>
netsh wlan show profile (put name of profile here) key=clear<br>
<br>
Hit Enter, and the password will be displayed on your screen.<br>

<strong>Installing and Updating Windows 11 Without an Internet Connection</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Windows 10 and Windows 11 builds are always released as International Standardization Organisation (ISO) disk image files.<br>
In Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise (not Windows 10 Home) you can double-click the ISO to "insert" the disk and view its contents.<br>
You can also right-click an ISO and burn the disk to DVD, Dual Layer DVD (DVD-DL) or CD, depending on its size.<br>
The Burn To Disk feature is not available in the Windows 10 Home edition.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Windows 10 and Windows 11 Installer can be downloaded for free from Microsoft.<br>
You can download and use the installer for free, but it is the Product Key<br>
that you will need to purchase and activate.<br>
<br>
Most newer Windows devices have a Windows product key already memorised in the device's hardware.<br>
<br>

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11</a><br>
TOOL:&nbsp; Microsoft:&nbsp; English-Great Britain:&nbsp; Software Download:&nbsp; Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File)<br>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO/">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO/</a><br>
<br>
The problem with the above webpage is that the content and choices displayed are based on your computer or device.<br>
<br>
If you want to download the Windows Installer as an ISO file,<br>
it will not offer that choice if the webpage sees that you are using Windows 10, or Windows 7 or 8.<br>
<br>
Here is how to download Microsoft's Windows Installer as an ISO file whilst on a Windows 10 device.<br>
<br>
You will need to use your browser to trick the webpage into thinking that you are on a Mobile device, or that you are using an OS other than Windows 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you open the above link in a device running Windows 7, 8, or 10, the webpage will not offer the ISO file download and you will not see the direct download links of Windows 10 offline ISO files. <br>
You can also just visit the page on any mobile phone to display the ISO file options.<br>
<br>
On older versions of the Google Chrome web browser, you can right-click on a blank area of the webpage,<br>
and click on Inspect.<br>
The webpage is moved over into a frame on the left, and the HTML code is revealed on the right-side frames.<br>
The right frame has a menu that reads, Elements, Console, Sources, Network, and Performance.<br>
Just to the left of the word, Elements, is a small icon that shows a small rectangle.<br>
It's supposed to be an icon of a tablet, with a smaller mobile device on top of it.<br>
This icon is the Toggle Device Toolbar.<br>
You can hover over it to see this name.<br>
When you click on this icon, the webpage will think that you are a mobile device.<br>
Refresh the webpage to see the ISO file option.<br>
You can click on the X in the top right corner to close the right-frames.<br>
<br>
The download link is unique to your visit and is only valid for 24 hours.<br>
<br>
Here is another way, using Google Chrome.<br>
In this example, we will trick the website into thinking that your Operating System is something other than Windows.<br>
Please note that this may cause you to get a different edition of Windows, like, the Education Edition.<br>
That installer may install the Education Edition, instead of the Home or Professional Edition.<br>
<br>
Windows 10 Education is distributed through Academic Volume Licensing. <br>
It has fewer features than Windows 10 Enterprise.<br>
<br>
RFUT:&nbsp; Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:&nbsp; Windows 10 editions -- 12 Different Versions of Windows 10 (as of 2018)<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_editions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_editions</a><br>
<br>
<br>
To make the website think that you are using a different OS...<br>
Right-click on the page and select Inspect.<br>
<br>
Look for three dots in the top right corner, and below that, there are another three dots just to the left of the X.<br>
<br>
Click the second three-dotted menu button on the top-right, just to the left of the X (not the one above the X), and, under "More tools", select Network conditions.<br>
<br>
The Network Conditions tool details are now being displayed in the lower-right frame.<br>
<br>
Look down in the lower-right frame, where it says, User Agent.<br>
Under User agent, clear (untick) the Select automatically option.<br>
<br>
Select a different drop-down menu option, like the Safari - iPad iOS 9 option, from the User agent drop-down menu.<br>
<br>
The Safari browser is only made for the Mac OS. <br>
(They did try once to make a version for Windows years ago, but it never caught on and was abandoned.)<br>
<br>
After you switch the user agent on Chrome,<br>
<br>
Refresh the page if the browser doesn't reload automatically.<br>
<br>
Select the edition of Windows 10 you want.<br>
<br>
Click the Confirm button.<br>
<br>
Pick your product language from the drop-down menu.<br>
<br>
Click the Confirm button.<br>
<br>
Click the button to download the Windows 10 ISO to begin the process.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the 64-bit choice is displayed second (for mobile devices)<br>
and sometimes the 64-bit button is displayed first (for Safari browsers on Macs)<br>
<br>
</p><hr><p>
<br>
Microsoft Edge Browser<br>
<br>
Right-click on the webpage and select Inspect element.<br>
<br>

If you don't see the option, open about:flags from the address bar, <br>
and check the "Show 'View source' and 'Inspect element' in the context menu" option.<br>
Click on Emulation.<br>
<br>
Under "Mode", change the user agent string to Apple Safari (ipad).<br>
<br>
Refresh the page if the browser doesn't reload automatically.<br>

If you are building a machine and you do not want to connect it to the internet until the Windows Updates are installed first, there is a way to get and install all of the Windows Updates up through last month without an Internet connection.<br>
<br>
<br>
Windows Updates are also available in an all-inclusive installer.<br>
The installer will install all major updates up through the month indicated.<br>
<br>
More precisely, the Cumulative Update app has all of the updates up through the third week of the month it was released.<br>
Updates that are more than three weeks into the current month will be included on next month's Cumulative Update app.<br>
<br>
Each month, a new Cumulative Update app is created for Windows 10.<br>
The title has the format of YYYY-MM each month.<br>
<br>
Do a search using syntax as shown below.<br>
<br>
<br>
Microsoft prefers to mention the year first, followed by the month.<br>
<br>
The syntax is<br>
Windows (build number YYMM) (year) (hyphen) (month) and the words, Cumulative Update<br>
<br>
Example<br>
Windows 1703 YYYY-MM Cumulative Update<br>
<br>
To do a search for the Cumulative Update for August 2017:<br>
Windows 1703 2017-08 Cumulative Update<br>
<br>
That would have all updates up through August 2017, for Windows 10 Build 1703, which is the build that was released in 2017, March.<br>
<br>
If you did a search using the above line,<br>
you would find the installer that is the Cumulative Update for Windows 10, Build 1703 (build released in 2017 March) Updater that has all updates through 2017 August (2017-08).<br>
<br>
If you want to know what build or version you have, navigate to this About Windows app and launch it:<br>
<br>
C:\Windows\System32\winver.exe<br>
<br>
The version number is the build number (not the OS build number shown inside the round brackets).<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Windows 11 Install on Older PCs</h3>
<p>
<br>
Windows 11 can run on many kinds of older or unsupported PCs.<br>
The Windows 11 installer does not know how to install on older PCs, but the Windows 10 installer does.<br>
Here is a way to install Windows 11 on other capable but unqualified PCs.<br><br>
<br>
Try to install Windows 11 using the normal Windows 11 Installer provided by Microsoft.<br>
If the install fails, here is something else to try.<br>
The Windows 11 Installer has trouble doing and completing installs, especially with older PCs.<br>
To fix this and get Windows 11 installed on older PCs, download the ISO files for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 from Microsoft.<br>
Have both ISO files saved onto the PC that you wish to upgrade.<br>
<br>
The computer to be upgraded should be disconnected from the internet.<br>
<br>
Now that you have the two ISO files on the older PC, mount the Windows 10 ISO by double-clicking the file name. You will see a new drive (E:) with several files and sub folders.<br>
<br>
<br>
Create a new folder somewhere on the old PC's C drive, and give the folder a unique name, like, "Windows11_Special," and copy all of the contents from the mounted Windows 10 ISO into this new folder. This will create a modifiable version of the mounted ISO file.<br>
<br>
Virtually Eject the Windows 10 ISO by right-clicking the drive (E:) and selecting "Eject" from the context menu.<br>
<br>
Next, mount the Windows 11 ISO file by double-clicking it. Double-click on the "sources" subfolder and scroll down to the a file named "install.wim."<br>
<br>
Find this same file in your special folder on your C drive. Replace that one on your C drive with this one.<br>
So, to do that, go into your special folder on your C drive, then go inside the "sources" subfolder, find the install.wim file, and delete it.<br>
<br>
You are replacing that Windows 10 install.wim file with the Windows 11 install.wim file on the Windows 11 ISO mounted disk.<br>
<br>
Again, the step is to copy the Windows 11 version of install.wim into the Windows11_Special/sources folder, replacing the Windows 10 version of that file with the Windows 11 file found there inside your sources folder.<br>
<br>
Once that has been done, unmount the Windows 11 ISO file by right-clicking the drive and selecting "Eject" from the context menu.<br>
<br>
At this point, you should turn off VBS and core isolation security on your soon-to-be-updated PC, if they are still on.<br>
<br>
Now, run the setup.exe app from your Windows11_Special folder and follow the prompts to reinstall Windows 10.<br>
You have placed the guts of Windows 11 inside of a Windows 10 installer.<br>
Of course, you won't be installing Windows 10, you will be installing Windows 11 without the normal testing for authorized CPUs and other system requirements.<br>
<br>
It is important that, during the install, look for and find the part that wants to install updates, and make sure it does not do that.<br>
You may need to click on a link or option to open that up and get it turned off.<br>
On the Windows 10 installer, here is what to look for.<br>
<br>
When the Install Windows 10 screen appears (even though it will really install Windows 11)<br>
Click on the link that says,<br>
Change how Windows Setup downloads updates<br>
<br>
Click the radio button for,<br>
Not at the moment<br>
<br>
Click the Next button.<br>
<br>
<br>
In other words, you have just now chosen to run the install without the online assistant or Windows updates. We want to install from the file we copied over and not from a file stored in the cloud.<br>
<br>
Continue with the install.<br>
<br>
If it says that the install failed, restart the computer.<br>
<br>
Go through it all a second time, and again, and If it says for the second time that the install failed, restart the computer.<br>
<br>
When the installation and update are complete, you should be running an official Windows 11 operating system on a PC with an older or unsupported CPU. You can copy the contents of your Windows11_Special folder to a USB thumb drive and use it to install Windows 11 on other capable but unqualified PCs as well.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Windows 10 Generic Product Keys Are Also Used for Windows 11</h3>
<p>They are also known as default product keys, since they are first installed by default until a unique key is entered.<br>
Default keys, published publically by Microsoft (see link below), are only used to assist with installation, and cannot be used for activation.<br />
<br>
Key Management Server (KMS) generic keys.&nbsp; Hosts activated via a KMS have to report back to that key server once every 180 days.<br>
<br>
The product keys below are also published on many other websites, including the following Microsoft website:<br>

</p>
<h2>Windows 11 System Requirements</h2><p>
<br>
<br>
Windows 11 System requirements -- JAN 2022<br>
<br>
These are the minimum system requirements for installing Windows 11 on a PC.<br>
<br>
Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster with 2 or more cores on a compatible 64-bit processor or System on a Chip (SoC).<br>
<br>
RAM: 4 gigabyte (GB).<br>
<br>
Storage: 64 GB or larger storage device<br>
<br>
System firmware: UEFI, Secure Boot capable.<br>
<br>
TPM: Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0.<br>
<br>
Graphics card: Compatible with DirectX 12 or later with WDDM 2.0 driver.<br>
<br>
Display: High definition (720p) display that is greater than 9" diagonally, 8 bits per colour channel.<br>
<br>
Internet connection and Microsoft account: Windows 11 Home edition requires internet connectivity and a Microsoft account.<br>
Switching a device out of Windows 11 Home in S mode also requires internet connectivity. <br>
For all Windows 11 editions, internet access is required to perform updates and to download and take advantage of some features.<br>
A Microsoft account is required for some features.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is personally recommended that the hard drive be no less than 128 GB.<br>
128 Gigabytes (GB) = 131072 Megabytes (MB)<br>
If you are going to buy a Windows device, and there is not at least 128 GB of hard disk capacity, I would advise you not to purchase it.<br>

<br />
The steps and procedures very, depending on the manufacturer.<br />
Usually there is a certain Function Key to press that will change the boot order or choose the optical drive or CD/DVD drive as the device to boot from.<br />
<br />
Another way is to go into the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS).&nbsp; Note that the BIOS technology is changing and is being replaced with new technology, like, for example, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) which supports Secure Boot, so these instructions may already be obsolete for new machines, as BIOS fades away and is replaced with UEFI.<br />
The way to get into the BIOS varies.&nbsp; It also usually involves repeatedly pressing a certain Function Key (F-Key, F1 through F9 on the keyboard.)&nbsp; Some keys typically used to boot into the BIOS are F1, F2, F12, or Escape (Esc).<br />
Once at the BIOS menu, usually, you use only the arrow keys to navigate, the Enter key to select or make changes, and the Escape (Esc) key go back out or Cancel.<br />
In most cases, navigate to System Configuration (or something with a similar name) and look for Boot Options, where you can control which devices are allowed to boot the machine, and in which sequence they will be examined for possible booting software.<br />
Make sure CD-ROM Boot, or CD/DVD boot, or sometihng to that effect, is Enabled.&nbsp; If there is an order that the devices are in, change the order so that the optical drive is examined first.&nbsp; Look across the bottom of the BIOS screen for instructions on how to select and move devices up and down the list.&nbsp; The machine will start at the top of the list and look at that device to see if it has boot software.&nbsp; If the drive is empty or does not contain bootable software, like some sort of bootable operating system, it will go to the next device in the list and see if it has an operating system that it can boot from.&nbsp;<br /> 
<br />
While in this area, look for an option called "Secure Boot."&nbsp; If you are not able to get your bootable DVD or bootable CD to run and boot up, you may need to Disable Secure Boot.&nbsp; Only newer machines have this option, and where you can enable and disable Secure Boot in the BIOS will vary.&nbsp; If you do need to disable Secure Boot, you may also need to tell Windows that it is disabled as well.<br />
Try to see if you can boot from DVD or CD while keeping Secure Boot on. If bootup by CD/DVD still does not work, then go into BIOS and Disable Secure Boot.<br />
There also may be circumstances where you need to disable Secure Boot in order to install a graphics card, some hardware, or other operating system that’s not compatible with Secure Boot.<br />
<br />
Secure Boot helps to make sure that your PC boots using only firmware that is trusted by the manufacturer.&nbsp; Secure Boot is a security standard developed by members of the PC industry to help make sure that your PC boots using only software that is trusted by the PC manufacturer.<br />
When the PC starts, the firmware checks the signature of each piece of boot software, including firmware drivers (Option ROMs) and the operating system. If the signatures are good, the PC boots, and the firmware gives control to the operating system.<br />
For most PCs, you can disable Secure Boot through the PC's firmware (BIOS) menus, as mentioned previously. For logo-certified Windows RT 8.1 and Windows RT PCs, Secure Boot is required to be configured so that it cannot be disabled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another way to Disable Secure Boot is to do it from Windows, rather from inside the BIOS.<br />
After windows starts up and is running, hold the Shift key while selecting Restart. Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced Options: UEFI Firmware Settings.<br />
Find the Secure Boot setting, and if possible, set it to Disabled. This option is usually in either the Security tab, the Boot tab, or the Authentication tab.<br />
Save changes and exit. The PC reboots.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you see a "SecureBoot isn't configured correctly" watermark in the lower-right corner of the desktop, a Windows Update has been released that will fix that and remove the watermark. In that case, run the Windows Update Control Panel.<br />
<br />
Many technicians are also taking their bootable software and installing it on a USB stick (thumb drive), so that they can boot from a USB stick.&nbsp; It is possible to boot up the Windows Installer and install Windows with a USB stick, instead of a DVD.&nbsp; Many new tablets and devices do not come with an optical drive, so the bootable USB stick is a popular way to install Windows.<br />
<br />
The instructions above on how to go about booting from an optical drive also should work if you want to make a USB stick (flash drive or thumb drive) be a bootable device.&nbsp; Just select the option for USB instead of the option for an optical drive in the instructions above.&nbsp; The remaining information applies only to those running Windows RT.<br />
<br />
Booting up a Windows RT device using an optical drive or USB has been made to be intentionally impossible for regular users, yet some technicians are starting to report that there may be some situations where Booting by USB stick and turning off Secure Boot may be possible in Windows RT in some rare situations, although it is intentionally supposed to be impossible to do.<br />
<br />
There may be three possible ways to do this:<br />
Volume Down + Power Button&nbsp; or<br />
Volume Up + Power Button&nbsp; or<br />
Volume Up + Windows Key on Tablet<br />
<br />
Again, one of the three possible ways to boot up a machine to a USB stick, running Windows RT, on some machines, is to hold down the volume down while powering on. <br />
<br />
On other models, you hold "Volume Up" and the Windows key on the tablet itself (not the keyboard Windows key).<br />
<br />
A third way may be to press and hold both the hardware Volume Up button (usually on the left side of the RT device) and press the Power button (usually on the top). Then, release the Volume Up button. <br />
<br />
Another way from within Windows, is to go to the Charms Bar on the right, Settings, Change PC Settings, and then navigate to Update and Recovery, then Recovery. Then, tap the Restart button under Advanced Startup, and when the system reboots into the Recovery environment, choose Troubleshoot, Advanced Options, and then UEFI Firmware Settings. Then, tap Restart.<br />
<br />
Some of the options you may find in the UEFI firmware interface:<br />
<br />
Delete All Secure Boot Keys. If you select this option and then Yes, Secure Boot will be changed from the usual User mode to Setup mode. In this mode, Secure Boot is disabled and the option changes to Install All Factory Default Keys. Select that and then choose between "Windows & 3rd party UEFI CA [certificate authorities] (Default)" and "Windows only."<br />
<br />
Configure External Ports. If you choose this option, you'll be presented with a pop-up menu with the following choices: All ports enabled (the default), Enable USB & microSD/Disable Docking Port, Enable Docking Port/Disable USB & microSD, and All ports disabled.<br />
<br />
Device Information. If you choose this option, you'll be presented with a pop-up that displays your Surface Pro 3's System UUID (universally unique identifier) and serial number, both of which are used to uniquely identify your device.<br />

SPECIAL NOTE:<br>
Windows 10 Build 1703 is a build that you should keep, so that you can install Windows 10 on older machines.<br>
Build 1703 was the last build that included the older hardware drivers for older computers.<br>
If you are trying to install Windows 10 on an older computer, and the installer can't run, or it can't find the hard drives,<br>
then you may need to install Windows 10 Build 1703 first, and then upgrade to the newer build after that.<br>
When the newer build is done, the older Build 1703 will be in moved into a<br>
folder that is usually called, Windows.old .<br>
<br>
<br>
On some older machines, you may need to install Windows 10 before upgrading to Windows 11.<br>
See also earlier on this page, the section titled, Windows 11 Evaluation.<br>
In that section are notes and instructions on<br>
Installing and Updating Windows 11 Without an Internet Connection<br>
and<br>

<br>
Be aware that Microsoft may not support Windows 11 running on Older PCs<br>
that do not meet the Windows 11 system requirements.<br>
<br>
<br>
During the install, the install appears to stop and require an internet connection.<br>

Those product keys may force you to install an edition that you do not want.<br>
<br>
If you want Pro and the product key in the hardware is forcing you to be Home edition,<br>
grab the generic, default pro key below and change it to that.<br>
You can change the edition to pro, but you cannot activate the pro with a generic, default key.<br>
<br>
You will need to buy it, and then change the default pro key to your purchased pro key.<br>
The keys below are only good for the installation and cannot be used for activation or permanent use.<br>

---come back here after installing Adobe apps to disable...<br>
Adobe Acrobat Update Service (AdobeARMservice)<br>
Adobe Genuine Software Integrity Service<br>
AdobeUpdateService<br>
<br>
If you can't disable them using the steps above,<br>
then you can find the same Services in the Registry below<br>
and disable them in the Registry, using the steps below.<br>
<br>
If we're all done with disabling Services here,<br>
we can now close the Services window.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another way to make changes to the Services is to<br>
do it directly inside the Registry.<br>
Some Registry keys did not allow changes to be made.<br>
Here is a way to get around that.<br>
<br>
Again, launch this app -- Right-click and run as admin.<br>
Registry Editor app (regedt32.exe)<br>
C:\Windows\System32\regedt32.exe<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Navigate to here<br>
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<br>
<br>
Here is the same list of Services in the Registry<br>
They are listed by file name, NOT by title.<br>
We have some titles listed below, followed by the actual file name to search for.<br>
For each file name listed below, find it and click on the yellow folder to see<br>
the values stored inside, displayed in the right column.<br>
In each key (yellow folder), find the value (in right column) titled, Start,<br>
and change is Data value to 4.<br>
The value of 4 is Disabled, setting the Service to disabled.<br>

<br>
After installing PrivateFirewall...<br>
<br>
<br>
Several apps to consider listing and blocking in PrivateFirewall are listed below...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\AdobeGCClient<br>
in there is an app called<br>
AGSService.exe<br>
<br>

to go back to the right panel listing of all of the sections.<br>
<br>
You will notice that, when you were looking in the Diagnostics & feedback section,<br>
The option to turn it completely off is not displayed there.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
New for DEC 2022:<br>
Windows 11 now will allow Diagnostic Data to be switched off.<br>
The switching off option did not exist in Windows 10.<br>
<br>
Here are the updated details published by Microsoft...<br>
<br>
In Group Policy, some of the policies have been renamed.<br>
Here are the new places to check.<br>
<br>
Open the Group Policy app again, and navigate as follows...<br>
<br>
Computer Configuration , Administrative Templates , Windows Components ,<br>
and click on the yellow folder for<br>
 Data Collection and Preview Builds.<br>
<br>
Over in the right section, click on<br>
Allow Diagnostic Data<br>
Set this Renamed policy<br>
to Diagnostic data off (not recommended)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the right section, click on<br>
Configure diagnostic data opt-in change notifications<br>
Set to Enabled.<br>
By having this Enabled, diagnostic data opt-in change notifications appear<br>
at first logon and when the changes occur in Settings.<br>
After the radio button in set to Enabled,<br>
A new drop-down menu will appear in the left white box.<br>
In the drop-down, select<br>
Enable diagnostic data change notifications<br>
Click Apply, Click OK.<br>
<br>
If Allow Diagnostic data is Disabled,<br>
then this policy will stay Disabled as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the right section, click on<br>
Limit Dump Collection<br>
Set to Enabled. Click Apply, click OK.<br>
<br>
The Limit dump collection policy is a new policy<br>
that can be used to limit the types of crash dumps<br>
that can be sent back to Microsoft.<br>
If this policy is enabled, Windows Error Reporting will send only<br>
kernel mini dumps and user mode triage dumps.<br>
<br>
If this is not Enabled, Microsoft may occasionally collect full or heap dumps<br>
if the user has opted to send optional diagnostic data.<br>
<br>
Since Windows Error Reporting was disabled earlier in these instructions,<br>
nothing should be sent at all -- no dumps should be sent at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
in the right section, click on<br>
Limit Diagnostic Log Collection<br>
Set to Enabled.<br>
<br>
If this policy is enabled, diagnostic logs aren't sent back to Microsoft.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Going back now to older instructions.<br>
<br>
Go to Control Panel, File Explorer Options.<br>

<br>
Click the magnifying glass icon in the taskbar.<br>
At the menu in the top right corner, click on the three dots.<br>
click Search Settings. In Windows 11, Settings will launch and take you to<br>

<br>
<br>
The search bar in the start menu does not work.<br>
You will have to do an internet search to find out where apps are in Windows 11.<br>
The start menu search bar does not work, and that is a known bug in Windows 11 as of DEC 2022.<br>
<br>
<br>
open up the File Explorer to see if<br>
you can search for files.<br>
Go to a folder, and try to search the folders inside that folder.<br>
Can you now search for local files on your PC?<br>
If no, then the next few steps should fix that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Launch Regedit <br>
<br>
navigate to<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\<br>
<br>
click on the yellow folder:<br>
System<br>
on the right-hand side, double click the<br>
ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin key<br>
and set its value to 0.<br>
<br>
After that, double click the EnableLUA key and set<br>
its value to 0 as well. In case you are missing this key,<br>
you will have to create it by right-clicking<br>
 New > DWORD (32-bit).<br>
<br>
Once you have made these changes, go ahead and restart your computer for the changes to take effect.<br>
After your PC boots up,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
open up the File Explorer to see if<br>
you can search for files.<br>
Can you now search for local files on your PC?<br>
If, yes, and it does work now, skip down to the next section, titled,<br>
Windows Modules Installer Worker app.<br>
<br>
Windows Search<br>
Do this only if Windows Search is still not working<br>
that is, you cannot search for local files on your PC.<br>
<br>
 right-click on Powershell and choose Run as administrator<br>
<br>
Once the Powershell window is open,<br>
type or paste the following command and then hit the Enter key:<br>
<br>
Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.Windows.Search | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}<br>
<br>
After doing that, go ahead and open Windows Explorer and see if the problem is still appearing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Windows Modules Installer Worker app<br>
<br>
<br>
Make sure these Services are Disabled.<br>
<br>
The Windows Modules Installer Worker app (TiWorker.exe)<br>
Windows Modules Installer -- TrustedInstaller<br>
are services that should already be disabled<br>
<br>
It's possible that some apps may not be created and installed until<br>
after the first time the computer is connected to the internet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
go to this directory...<br>
C:\Windows\WinSxS<br>
and once there, do a search for these three apps.<br>
poqexec.exe<br>
tifilefetcher.exe<br>
TiWorker.exe<br>
<br>
here are the names of the apps<br>
Primitive Operations Queue Executor (poqexec.exe)<br>
Windows Modules File Fetcher (tifilefetcher.exe)<br>
Windows Modules Installer Worker app (TiWorker.exe)<br>
<br>
<br>
once you find the app, go up one level to folder it is in.<br>
Change FOLDER ownership to yourself, then give yourself full control.<br>
Now go back into the folder and change the app file extensions by adding .OLD at the end<br>
so they will look like this...<br>
poqexec.exe.OLD<br>
tifilefetcher.exe.OLD<br>
TiWorker.exe.OLD<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Do this search again for the above three apps<br>
after the computer is connected to the Internet for the first time,<br>
and see if Windows created and installed additional instances of this app.<br>

Since PrivateFirewall is mentioned throughout these notes,<br>
search this entire webpage (Ctrl+F) and look at every spot where<br>
PrivateFirewall is found, so you will not miss any notes about<br>
secret apps that need to be located and controlled.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After installing PrivateFirewall...<br>
<br>
<br>
(The following notes are from 2018.)<br>
Several apps to consider listing and blocking in PrivateFirewall are listed below...<br>
<br>
Disk Space Clean-up Manager for Windows -- c:\windows\system32\cleanmgr.exe<br>
cleanmgr.exe is the app that keeps making the DISM apps in the Temp folder.<br>
C:\Windows\System32\cleanmgr.exe<br>
Block that app from running to stop the DISM apps from constantly being created, installed and ran.<br>
<br>
<br>
FYI: Point PrivateFirewall to the following hidden app and use PrivateFirewall to make it not run.<br>
the name of the app is<br>
Windows Update Client API Host<br>
<br>
Use PrivateFirewall to disable this so that it does not run<br>
(This is an invisible System app)<br>
c:\windows\system32\wuapihost.exe<br>
<br>
And also use the Sordum Windows Update Blocker app mentioned earlier to keep Windows Update Off.<br>
<br>
<br>
and also add the following apps into the PrivateFirewall list...<br>
Windows Modules Installer -- TrustedInstaller.exe<br>
C:\Windows\servicing\TrustedInstaller.exe<br>
Change Owner to yourself<br>
then edit all permissions for all users so that they can only read,<br>
but they cannot read and execute.<br>
Otherwise, this app will launch every few minutes when there is an Internet connection.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Windows Modules Installer Worker app (TiWorker.exe)<br>
is inside this directory:<br>
C:\Windows\WinSxS -- the actual, full path varies by device and Windows build number.<br>
An example of where it could be found on a machine with an AMD 64 bit processor...<br>
C:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-servicingstack_(several unique characters based on your device and Windows build number)......\TiWorker.exe<br>
also in that same directory...<br>
Primitive Operations Queue Executor (poqexec.exe)<br>
Windows Modules File Fetcher (tifilefetcher.exe)<br>
<br>
and further more...<br>
Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry<br>
C:\Windows\System32\CompatTelRunner.exe<br>
<br>
UsoClient<br>
C:\Windows\System32\UsoClient.exe<br>
<br>
These apps may be invisible, but you can copy and paste the above paths to add them quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
You can also use Task Manager to wait for when it runs, and then jump directly to its precise location, using Task Manager.<br>

Stop Video Advert Auto-Play<br>
<br>
<br>
Chrome and Opera are both Chromium browsers.<br>
Google Chrome Extensions also work in Opera.<br>
<br>
These two Extensions, once installed in Chrome or Opera,<br>
will stop all videos from automatically playing when you visit a webpage.<br>
<br>
This is important to control, so that your bandwidth does not go towards playing HD video adverts that you did not request to see.<br>
<br>
If you have these folders saved, you can just drop these folders into your Extension folder to install these Extensions.<br>
Or, use the links below, and when you see the Extensions Details, just click on the Add to Opera button.<br>
(or it would be an Add to Chrome button if you use Chrome.)<br>
<br>
If your browser was installed, and is not portable, the Extensions folder would be here...<br>
Chrome:<br>
C:\Users\[Your_User_Name]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions<br>
<br>
Opera:<br>
(or something similar to the above, this might change in newer versions)<br>
C:\Users\[Your_User_Name]\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable<br>
<br>
This was accurate as of March 2022, but the app folder names may eventually change since that time.<br>
<br>
If you are running Opera Portable, the Extension folders will be found here<br>
(depending on where the portable app is, open the OperaPortable folder and navigate as follows.)<br>
..\OperaPortable\App\Opera\profile\data\Extensions<br>
and in that Extensions folder, you will see folders that have the long names as shown in the links below.<br>
(32 letters long)<br>
<br>
<br>
Chrome and Opera are both Chromium browsers.<br>
Google Chrome Extensions also work in Opera.<br>
<br>
If you get a newer, updated version, then the long folder name will change as well.<br>
When you see the item in the webpage search results, click on the item and see the details of the Extension.<br>
Look at the URL and you will also see in there the exact name of the folder to locate in your Extensions folder.<br>
<br>
You select the folder by holding down the right-mouse button, to drag and drop.<br>
Once you release the right-mouse-button, you will be given the option to Copy it to where you dropped it.<br>
Right-mouse-drag to copy and drag the folder with the long name only, the long bunch of letters, into the Extensions folder.<br>
<br>
When you are done, the path should look like this, if running Opera Portable,<br>
<br>
1.Disable HTML5 Autoplay Reloaded<br>
..\OperaPortable\App\Opera\profile\data\Extensions\cafckninonjkogajnihihlnnimmkndgf<br>
<br>
2.AutoplayStopper<br>
..\OperaPortable\App\Opera\profile\data\Extensions\ejddcgojdblidajhngkogefpkknnebdh<br>
<br>
and, inside the Extensions folder, you will then see these folders...<br>
cafckninonjkogajnihihlnnimmkndgf<br>
ejddcgojdblidajhngkogefpkknnebdh<br>
<br>
and you may see others in there that are other Extensions besides just these two.<br>
<br>
and that's all. You're done. Enjoy!<br>

<br />
If you're not yet signed in to Windows, after the machine has booted up, tap or click the Power icon in the lower right corner of the sign-in screen, hold down a Shift key, and then tap or click Restart.<br />
<br />
If you are already signed in, and you wish to Restart Windows 8.1 into Safe Mode, use your finger and touchscreen to swipe in from the right edge of the screen to bring up the Charms Bar, then tap Settings, and then tap Change PC settings.<br />
If you're using a mouse, hover the mouse into to the lower-right or upper-right edge of the screen, wait one second for the Charms Bar to appear along the right, then, down near the bottom-right, click Settings, and then click Change PC settings.<br />
<br />
Under PC settings, tap or click Update and recovery, and then tap or click Recovery.<br />
<br />
