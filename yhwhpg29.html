Rescue<br>
<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 5:11 (TS2009)<br>
But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; Let them ever shout for joy, because You shelter them; And let those who love Your Name exult in You.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Isaiah) 25:4 (TS2009)<br>
For You shall be a refuge to the poor, a refuge to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat....<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 61:3 (KJV)<br>
For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 61: 2-4 -- NLT <br>
2<br>
From the ends of the earth,<br>
I cry to you for help<br>
when my heart is overwhelmed.<br>
Lead me to the towering rock of safety,<br>
3<br>
for you are my safe refuge,<br>
a fortress where my enemies cannot reach me.<br>
4<br>
Let me live forever in your sanctuary,<br>
safe beneath the shelter of your wings!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 18:10 (KJV)<br>
The name of the LORD is a strong tower: The righteous runneth into it, and is safe.<br>
(The righteous runneth into it, and is set aloft.)<br>
<br>
Proverbs 18:10 (NLT)<br>
The name of the Lord is a strong fortress; the godly run to him and are safe.<br>
<br>
(Proverbs) 18:10 (TS2009)<br>
The Name of Yaw-Who-Wah is a strong tower; The righteous run into it and are safe.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Jeremiah) 17:17 (TS2009)<br>
...You are my shelter in the day of evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: It seems that the KJV translation team only used the word, "rescue," three times in the KJV Bible that we have today.<br>
The NLT team liked using the word, Rescue, so we see it being used a lot more in the NLT.<br>
There are several occasions, especially in the book of Psalms, where someone is praying and asking God, which, in Hebrew, would be, EE-Low-Heem,<br>
asking Him to please rescue me.<br>
But there are also some verses where the Lord tells us, I will rescue you.<br>
Let's find several of those verses where the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, tells us in the Bible that He is going to rescue us.<br>
Since the word, Rescue, is mainly found in the NLT, we will be mainly quoting Bible verses from the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 18:27 (NLT)<br>
You rescue the humble, but you humiliate the proud.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 22:28 (NLT)<br>
You rescue the humble, but your eyes watch the proud and humiliate them.<br>
<br>
Psalms 33: 18-21 (KJV)<br>
33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;<br>
33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.<br>
33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.<br>
33:21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 33: 9-22 (NLT)<br>
9<br>
For when he spoke, the world began!<br>
It appeared at his command.<br>
10<br>
The Lord frustrates the plans of the nations<br>
and thwarts all their schemes.<br>
11<br>
But the Lord's plans stand firm forever;<br>
his intentions can never be shaken.<br>
12<br>
What joy for the nation whose God is the Lord,<br>
whose people he has chosen as his inheritance.<br>
13<br>
The Lord looks down from heaven<br>
and sees the whole human race.<br>
14<br>
From his throne he observes<br>
all who live on the earth.<br>
15<br>
He made their hearts,<br>
so he understands everything they do.<br>
16<br>
The best-equipped army cannot save a king,<br>
nor is great strength enough to save a warrior.<br>
17<br>
Don't count on your warhorse to give you victory --<br>
for all its strength, it cannot save you.<br>
18<br>
But the Lord watches over those who fear him,<br>
those who rely on his unfailing love.<br>
19<br>
He rescues them from death<br>
and keeps them alive in times of famine.<br>
20<br>
We put our hope in the Lord.<br>
He is our help and our shield.<br>
21<br>
In him our hearts rejoice,<br>
for we trust in his holy name.<br>
22<br>
Let your unfailing love surround us, Lord,<br>
for our hope is in you alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 33: 9-22 (TS2009)<br>
9 For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood fast.<br>
10 Yaw-Who-Wah brings the counsel of the nations to naught; He thwarts the plans of the peoples.<br>
11 The counsel of Yaw-Who-Wah stands forever, The plans of His heart to all generations.<br>
12 Blessed is the nation whose Elohim is Yaw-Who-Wah, The people whom He has chosen as His own inheritance.<br>
13 Yaw-Who-Wah has looked from the heavens; He has seen all the sons of men.<br>
14 He looked from His dwelling place On all the inhabitants of the earth --<br>
15 He who fashions the hearts of them all, He who understands all their works.<br>
16 The sovereign is not saved by the multitude of an army; A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.<br>
17 A horse is a vain means of safety; Neither does it rescue any by its great power.<br>
18 See, the eye of Yaw-Who-Wah is on those fearing Him, On those waiting for His loving-commitment,<br>
19 To deliver their being from death, And to keep them alive during scarcity of food.<br>
20 Our being has longed for Yaw-Who-Wah; Our help and our shield is He.<br>
21 For our heart does rejoice in Him, For we have put our trust in His set-apart Name.<br>
22 Let Your loving-commitment, O Yaw-Who-Wah, be upon us, Even as we wait for You.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34: 17-19 (NLT)<br>
17<br>
The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.<br>
He rescues them from all their troubles.<br>
18<br>
The Lord is close to the broken-hearted;<br>
he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.<br>
19<br>
The righteous person faces many troubles,<br>
but the Lord comes to the rescue each time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37: 39 & 40 (NLT)<br>
39<br>
The Lord rescues the godly;<br>
he is their fortress in times of trouble.<br>
40<br>
The Lord helps them,<br>
rescuing them from the wicked.<br>
He saves them,<br>
and they find shelter in him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37: 39 & 40 (TS2009)<br>
39 But the deliverance of the righteous is from Yaw-Who-Wah, Their strength in time of distress.<br>
40 And Yaw-Who-Wah does help them and deliver them; He delivers them from the wrongdoers and saves them, Because they took refuge in Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 72: 12-14 (KJV)<br>
72:12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.<br>
72:13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.<br>
72:14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 72: 11-14 (NLT)<br>
11<br>
All kings will bow before him,<br>
and all nations will serve him.<br>
12<br>
He will rescue the poor when they cry to him;<br>
he will help the oppressed, who have no one to defend them.<br>
13<br>
He feels pity for the weak and the needy,<br>
and he will rescue them.<br>
14<br>
He will redeem them from oppression and violence,<br>
for their lives are precious to him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 91: 2 & 3 (NLT)<br>
2<br>
This I declare about the Lord:<br>
He alone is my refuge, my place of safety;<br>
he is my God, and I trust him.<br>
3<br>
For he will rescue you from every trap<br>
and protect you from deadly disease.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 91: 2 & 3 (TS2009)<br>
2 He is saying of Yaw-Who-Wah, "My refuge and my stronghold, My Elohim, in whom I trust!"<br>
3 For He delivers you from the snare of a trapper, From the destructive pestilence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 17: 37-39 (NLT)<br>
37 Be careful at all times to obey the decrees, regulations, instructions, and commands that he wrote for you. You must not worship other gods.<br>

<br>
<br>

38 "And do not forget the covenant that I have made with you, and do not fear other mighty ones.<br>

14<br>
The Lord says, "I will rescue those who love me.<br>

15<br>
When they call on me, I will answer;<br>

If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us....<br>
<br>
That comes from the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, which we read back in Christian Essays 4.<br>
Here is a little sample from that scene...<br>
<br>
Daniel 3: 16-18 (NLT)<br>
16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you.<br>
17 If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty.<br>
18 But even if he doesn't, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up."<br>

Isaiah 7:15 (KJV)<br>
Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 7:15 (NLT)<br>
By the time this child is old enough to choose what is right and reject what is wrong, he will be eating (curds and) yogurt and honey.<br>
<br>
(Isaiah) 7:15 (TS2009)<br>
"He eats curds and honey when He knows to refuse evil and choose the good.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Yogurt can be spelled three different ways.<br>
1. In the United States, it is normally spelled, y o g u r t.<br>
2. In the United Kingdom, it may also be spelled with an H, like this, y o g h u r t.<br>
3. In some rare situations, it might be spelled with the H and an extra letter O, like this, y o g h o u r t.<br>
<br>
If you eat the Bible, that is, you let the Bible enter into you, then you may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.<br>
Then, studying and obeying the Bible will make you grow up and become mature enough to choose what is right and reject what is wrong.<br>
Babies do not know much about right and wrong because they are babies.<br>
Isaiah 7:15 is mentioning foods that only more mature children can digest.<br>
The honey from the rock, The Bible, is bad for babies because they are still being made to fall asleep by having only breastmilk for breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br>
Honey is bad for babies because it can have Clostridium botulinum, which can produce botulinum spores that secrete toxins.<br>
An infant's intestinal tract is not strong enough to fight off these spores and toxins, and it can lead to death for an infant.<br>
A baby Christian's never-reading-the-Bible intestinal tract is not strong enough to fight off spiritual attacks.<br>
A baby also cannot digest the enzymes and proteins in dairy products before his or her first birthday.<br>
<br>
<br>
If some Christians are like babies, and the Bible is like honey, and the promised land is a land flowing with milk and honey, then the spirit-filled life, the promised land, is not for babies.<br>
This picture of Christian maturity or immaturity is echoed in the Scriptures, and it tells us that,<br>
some people that do not want to grow up and become spiritually mature may have trouble digesting and processing the truth in the Bible, like eating the scroll that caused a sour tummy.<br>
<br>
Lord Jesus, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, help baby Christians going to baby-school churches, stuck on nothing but breastmilk, year after year after year,<br>
help them break away from baby patterns, and help them graduate to the honey in the Bible, to the solid foods and meats in Torah commandment obedience, so that they too will be wise enough to choose what is right and reject what is wrong.<br>
In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
My wife once asked an old man who had been going to the same baby-Christian-church for 65 years, Are you saved?<br>
His answer, again, an old man who had been going to the same church for 65 years, his answer was, I don't know.<br>
So, we opened up a can of Romans 10:9 and, well, we know he is saved now, and I'll be happy to introduce you to him when we get to heaven.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Are you not really sure about what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is evil, what is a sin, and what is not a sin?<br>
Read your entire Bible, from cover to cover.<br>
If you do, you will clearly know what is sin and what is not sin.<br>
If you do, you will clearly know what is right and what is wrong.<br>
If you do, you will clearly know what is good and what is evil.<br>
If you do, you will clearly know what is truth and what is a lie.<br>
<br>
You keep talking and singing to someone named, You. You are this and you are that?<br>
Who is this one that you keep referring to as, You?<br>
Are you able to put his actual name in a song, or are you going to just keep on singing to someone named, You?<br>
Someone you love? A lover? God? Is that it? God?<br>
Call upon His actual, real name.<br>
You keep saying, God.<br>
What so-called god are you talking about?<br>
God is a He. The Bible only says that God is a He.  The Heavenly Father, the Beloved Son, and the Spirit that is Holy, are all referred to as, He.<br>
Proverbs 30:4 was asking you and me a very important question. The question is this.<br>
What is His name, and what is His son's name? Are you able to tell me this?<br>
Can you tell me what the actual name of your God really is?<br>
Are you a Christian?  Are you saved?  Are you going to live forever in Heaven?<br>
This is a test.  Fortunately, this is an open-book test.<br>
But, like all tests, there is a time limit. When your body dies, your test gets turned in, and whatever you wrote down, if anything, and your answers become final, and the answers cannot be changed when your time is up.<br>
You can still change the answers now if any of them are wrong or missing.<br>

In Christian Essays 5, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 5,<br>
we mentioned the song, You Say, by Lauren Daigle.<br>
<br>
That song has been one of the most popular Christian songs for at least four solid years,<br>
from 2018 to the end of at least the year 2021.<br>
<br>
Take a look at the charts found on Billboard Magazine's website.<br>
<br>
Billboard Magazine's<br>
Year-End Charts of Hot Christian Songs<br>
The most popular Hot Christian Songs for the entire year, according to Billboard Magazine.<br>
2016: Number 2 is Trust In You by Lauren Daigle. Number 1 in 2016 was Oceans (Where Feet May Fail) by Hillsong United.<br>
2018: Number 2 is You Say by Lauren Daigle, Number 1 in 2018 was Reckless Love by Cory Asbury.<br>
2019: Number 1 for 2019 was You Say by Lauren Daigle.  The Number 4 most popular Hot Christian Song for 2019 was Rescue, by Lauren Daigle.<br>
2020: The Number 1 most popular, Hot Christian Song for 2020 was, again, You Say by Lauren Daigle.<br>
2021: And the Number 1 Hot Christian Song for all of 2021 was, once again, You Say by Lauren Daigle.<br>
<br>
So, You Say, was the most popular song for three straight years, 2019, 2020 and for 2021.<br><br>
We have looked at Bible verses and we read the words to that song in a Bible Study titled,<br>
You Say and The Bible Says<br>
which is found in Christian Essays 5, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 5.<br>
<br>
As mentioned just a moment ago, the Number 4 most popular Hot Christian Song for the entire year of 2019 was, Rescue, by Lauren Daigle.<br>
The song, Rescue, is a song by American contemporary Christian music singer and songwriter Lauren Daigle.<br>
It is the third single from her third studio album, Look Up Child.<br>
The album, Look Up Child, was released on 7 September 2018.<br>
"Rescue" was released to Christian radio and as a single on 12 July 2019 as the third single from the album, Look Up Child.<br>
It peaked at No. 2 on Billboard Magazine's Christian Songs chart and at No. 12 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100.<br>
The single was scheduled to be released to Hot Adult Contemporary Hit radio on 22 July 2019,<br>
but was actually released to Hot Adult Contemporary Hit radio on 19 August 2019.<br>
<br>
She also released a Spanish version and a quiet, more calm remix, called a Chill Mix.<br>
There is also, apparently, an unofficial slow dance remix made by someone else and released on YouTube.<br>
It is the Hydro Walkers Remix, and with its interesting harmonic additions, I would recommend that as a good remix to listen to.<br>
<br>
In the song that we are about to talk about here, in the words to the song, Rescue, there is a mention of something called, SOS.<br>
Although SOS, in popular usage, is an acronym commonly associated with phrases such as "Save Our Souls" and "Save Our Ship",<br>
originally, SOS is a Morse code distress signal.<br>
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardised sequences of two different signal durations,<br>
called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs.<br>
Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph. He was born in 1791, and he died in 1872.<br>
The American artist, inventor and painter Samuel Morse, the American physicist Joseph Henry, and mechanical engineer Alfred Vail developed an electrical telegraph system.<br>
It needed a method to transmit natural language using only patterns of electrical pulses and the silence between them, sent back and forth across a simple electric wire. Around 1837, Morse, therefore developed an early forerunner to the modern International Morse code.<br>
The Morse system for telegraphy, was used in about 1844.<br>
Even the name used today, AT&T, stands for American Telephone and Telegraph Company.<br>
The Western Union Company, used today for doing Wire transfers, Money orders and Money transfers, originally was known as the Western Union Telegraph Company.<br>
The electrical telegraph was a point-to-point text messaging system, used from the 1840s until the late 20th century when it was slowly replaced by other telecommunication systems.<br>
It was a way, back in 1832, to send messages across electric wires, before the invention of the telephone which was not until the year, 1876.<br>
It took many years after that for the telephone to eventually become as popular as the telegraph.<br>
Although commercial "telegraph" services are still available in many countries, transmission is usually done via a computer network rather than a dedicated wired connection.<br>
<br>
SOS is a distress signal that means, Save Our Ship, and that you are in need of being rescued.<br>
The pattern for the letter S, is long, long, long.<br>
The pattern for the letter O is short, short, short.<br>
So, as light, you can use a torch or flashlight.<br>
With some of the new torches or flashlights today, you can press the power button a few times, and it will automatically flash the SOS light pattern.<br>
You can also use a mirror and the reflection of the sun to signal the SOS light pattern.<br>
As light, the SOS pattern would be, quick flash, quick flash, quick flash, pause, long flash, long flash, long flash, pause, quick flash, quick flash, quick flash.<br>
If you were buried under something in an earthquake, and you could tap or bang on something loud so that people could find you,<br>
the SOS as a sound pattern would be, tap, tap, tap, pause, pause, -- tap, pause; tap, pause; tap, pause; -- pause, pause, tap, tap, tap.<br>
So, in summary, SOS is a Morse code distress signal, used when someone is marooned, trapped or stuck, and is in need of being rescued.<br>
The Lord promises to rescue us. Think again about all of those sweet-as-honey Bible verses that we just ate, where He says to you and to me, I will rescue you.<br>
<br>
From her 2018 album, Look Up Child, here are the words to the song, Rescue, by Lauren Daigle.<br>
<br>
<br>
You are not hidden<br>
There's never been a moment<br>
You were forgotten<br>
You are not hopeless<br>
Though you have been broken<br>
Your innocence stolen<br>

I hear your SOS, your SOS<br>
<br>
I will send out an army<br>
To find you in the middle of the darkest<br>
Night, it's true,<br>
I will rescue you<br>
<br>
<br>
There is no distance<br>
That cannot be covered<br>
Over and over<br>
You're not defenceless<br>
I'll be your shelter<br>
I'll be your armour<br>
<br>
I hear you whisper underneath your breath<br>
I hear your SOS, your SOS<br>
<br>
I will send out an army<br>
To find you In the middle of the darkest<br>
Night, It's true, I will rescue you<br>
<br>
I will<br>
Never stop marching<br>
To reach you<br>
In the middle of the hardest<br>
Fight, It's true, I will rescue you<br>
<br>
I hear the whisper underneath your breath<br>
I hear you whisper,<br>
You have nothing left<br>
<br>
I will<br>
Send out an army to find you<br>
In the middle of the darkest<br>
Night, It's true, I will rescue you<br>
<br>
I will<br>
Never stop marching<br>
To reach you<br>
In the middle of the hardest<br>
Fight, It's true, I will rescue you<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, I will rescue you<br>

Romans Chapter 12 -- All of chapter 12, all 21 verses -- KJV<br>
1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.<br>
2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br>
3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is amongst you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; (but to think to sobriety) but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.<br>
4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:<br>
5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.<br>
6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;<br>
7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;<br>
8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: (he that imparteth,) he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.<br>
9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.<br>
10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;<br>
11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;<br>
12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;<br>
13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.<br>
14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.<br>
15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.<br>
<br>
16 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, (but be contented with mean things) but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.<br>
17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.<br>
18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.<br>
19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.<br>
20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.<br>
21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans Chapter 12 -- All of chapter 12, all 21 verses -- NLT<br>
1 And so, (dear brothers,) dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice -- the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him.<br>
(This is your reasonable service.)<br>
<br>
2 Don't copy the behaviour and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.<br>
<br>
(Because of the grace God has given me, I give each of you this warning)<br>
3 Because of the privilege and authority God has given me, I give each of you this warning: Don't think you are better than you really are. Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us.<br>
(Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given you.)<br>
(Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the standard of our God-given faith.)<br>
<br>
4 Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function,<br>
5 so it is with Christ's body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other.<br>
6 In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as God has given you.<br>
7 If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, teach well.<br>
8 If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. If it is giving, give generously. If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others, do it gladly.<br>
9 Don't just pretend to love others. Really love them. Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good.<br>
<br>
(Love each other with brotherly love,)<br>
10 Love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honouring each other.<br>
11 Never be lazy, but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically.<br>
(Never be lazy, but serve the Lord with a zealous spirit.)<br>
(Never be lazy, but let the Spirit excite you as you serve the Lord.)<br>
<br>
<br>
12 Rejoice in our confident hope. Be patient in trouble, and keep on praying.<br>
13 When God's people are in need, be ready to help them. Always be eager to practice hospitality.<br>
14 Bless those who persecute you. Don't curse them; pray that God will bless them.<br>
15 Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep.<br>
16 Live in harmony with each other. Don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don't think you know it all!<br>
17 Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honourable.<br>
18 Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone.<br>
19<br>
Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For (in Deuteronomy 32:35) the Scriptures say,<br>
"I will take revenge;<br>
I will pay them back,"<br>
says the Lord.<br>
20<br>
Instead,<br>
"If your enemies are hungry, feed them.<br>
If they are thirsty, give them something to drink.<br>
In doing this, you will heap<br>
burning coals of shame on their heads."<br>
(that is a quote from Proverbs 25: 21 & 22)<br>
21<br>
Don't let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.<br>
<br>

When I Read the Bible Through<br>
is a poem by Amos Russel Wells<br>
He was born in 1862, and he passed away in 1933.<br>
<br>
Amos Russel Wells was a United States editor, author and a professor of Greek and geology at Antioch College from 1883 to 1891.<br>
In 1891 he was also an editor of the Christian Endeavor World magazine and publishing company, in Boston.<br>
From 1901, he was associate author of Peloubet's Notes on the Sunday School Lessons.<br>
He was a member of the International Sunday-School Lesson Committee.<br>
<br>
His works include books dealing with young people's work, the Sunday school, juvenile fiction, poetry and devotional literature.<br>
<br>
<br>
He used the Christian Endeavor World, in Boston, to publish a book of his poems, in 1921.<br>
The book is titled, "The Collected Poems of Amos R. Wells".<br>
It has 257 pages, with illustrations by Hiram Putnam Barnes,<br>
and one on page 34 by Charles D. Hubbard.<br>
Page 249 to page 257, those last 9 pages, are an Index of all of the poem titles and topics.<br>
I want to share with you, a poem that he has on Page 8.<br>
<br>
The poem is titled, When I Read the Bible Through.<br>
<br>
It is a poem that repeats the message that I shared with you,<br>
way back when we were in Christian Essays 1,<br>
when I told that short story in the Christian Essay: Best Seller.<br>
The point was, when we randomly jump around in a book and just read a random verse or sample, here and there, that is not how you're supposed to read a book!<br>
You're supposed to start at the beginning and read each page completely all the way to the end! How can you get all that the book has to offer when you only read little bits and pieces, here and there, randomly like that?<br>
<br>
Well, I ask you, what's wrong with me reading a book like that?  I mean, after all, isn't that how we all read our Bibles?<br>
<br>
Some people have been sharing a poorly paraphrased version of this poem on the Internet,<br>
and then they say that the author is unknown, which is not true.<br>
<br>
The book is in Public Domain and has no copyright anymore.<br>
The entire book can be viewed and read online, for free at<br>
the HathiTrust Digital Library.<br>
HathiTrust is a partnership of academic and research institutions, offering a collection of over 17 million titles of digitised items from libraries around the world.<br>
Here is the website address as it was found in February 2022.&nbsp; Babel Collections at the HathiTrust Digital Library: The Collected Poems of Amos R. Wells.<br>
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t6xw52k04">https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t6xw52k04</a><br>
<br>
In this poem is the English word, coruscant.<br>
Most dictionaries do not even have this word listed at all.<br>
It was eventually found in the Collins Dictionary.<br>
In February 2022, I went to the Collins Dictionary to look up the word, coruscant.<br>
And, according to the Collins Dictionary, coruscant, means,<br>
giving off flashes of light.<br>
So, when you read the part in the poem that says, Imperial Jeremiah, With his keen, coruscant mind;<br>
I think the author is trying to say that Jeremiah has a mind that thinks as fast as a flash of lightning.<br>
But the Bible does not really say that.<br>
This has nothing to do with Coruscant, the planet that has the same name in the fictional Star Wars universe.<br>
<br>
Here is the poem, titled,<br>
When I Read the Bible Through<br>
as found on Page 8 of the 1921 book, "The Collected Poems of Amos R. Wells"<br>
written by Amos Russel Wells.<br>
<br>
<br>
I supposed I knew my Bible<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Reading piecemeal, hit and miss,<br>
Now a bit of John or Matthew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now a snatch of Genesis,<br>
Certain chapters of Isaiah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Certain Psalms (the twenty-third!);<br>
Twelfth of Romans, First of Proverbs --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yes, I thought I knew the Word!<br>
But I found that thorough reading<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Was a different thing to do,<br>
And the way was unfamiliar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When I read the Bible through.<br>
<br>
Oh, the massive, mighty volume!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Oh, the treasures manifold!<br>
Oh, the beauty of the wisdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And the grace it proved to hold!<br>
As the story of the Hebrews<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Swept in majesty along,<br>
As it leaped in waves prophetic,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As it burst to sacred song,<br>
As it gleamed with Christly omens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Old Testament was new,<br>
Strong with cumulative power,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When I read the Bible through.<br>
<br>
Ah! Imperial Jeremiah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  With his keen, coruscant mind;<br>
And the blunt old Nehemiah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And Ezekiel refined!<br>
Newly came the Minor Prophets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each with his distinctive robe,<br>
Newly came the Song idyllic,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And the tragedy of Job;<br>
Deuteronomy, the regal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To a towering mountain grew,<br>
With its comrade peaks around it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When I read the Bible through.<br>
<br>
What a radiant procession<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As the pages rise and fall,<br>
James the sturdy, John the tender<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  O the myriad-minded Paul!<br>
Vast apocalyptic glories<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wheel and thunder, flash and flame,<br>
Whilst the church triumphant raises<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  One incomparable Name.<br>
Ah, the story of the Saviour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Never glows supremely true<br>
Till you read it whole and swiftly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Till you read the Bible through.<br>
<br>
You who like to play at Bible,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dip and dabble, here and there,<br>
Just before you kneel, aweary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And yawn through a hurried prayer;<br>
You who treat the Crown of Writings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As you treat no other book --<br>
Just a paragraph disjointed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Just a crude, impatient look --<br>
Try a worthier procedure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Try a broad and steady view;<br>
You will kneel in very rapture<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When you read the Bible through!<br>
<br>

<br>
Commentary: I'd like to share with you here next, the words to one of his songs, titled, My Reward.<br>
Yes, we are looking forward to the day that we see him, and get to be in Heaven with him.<br>
However, there an aspect about this song that I would like to comment about.<br>
It is possible to interpret the song as having a message that would be, we are just waiting around for the day when we go to Heaven.<br>
We're just waiting around, with nothing to do.  As though we were at a bus stop, waiting for the bus, or we're just standing around at a train station, waiting for the train to arrive,  or a chariot of fire to come down from the sky and swoop us up into the clouds.<br>
The Bible teaches us, until that day comes, we have a list of things to do.<br>
Here is a paraphrased, compiled list for you and for me...<br>
1. Read your Bible, all of it, study all of it, and try your best to do what it says, and obey it, every day.<br>
2. Pray for each other, what you see and what He reveals to you, pray for that.<br>
3. Love one another, and look for ways to help each other.<br>
4. Take the people that are in your life, and make their interests more important than your own.<br>
Spend some time with each of one them, and make what it is that they want to do more important than what you want to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the words to one of his songs, titled, My Reward.<br>
There is a Studio Version, and a Live Version.<br>
The Studio Version is extremely hard to find.<br>
It was found in 2006, but it may be as old as 2003.<br>
The only recording that seems to be easy to find on the Internet is the Live Version.<br>
Since we are quoting here from the original Studio Version, we will not be including any lyrics from the Live version.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the original Studio Version of the song, My Reward, by Paul Baloche.<br>
<br>
<br>
I want to hear You say, the words to me, "well done"<br>
I want to hear You say, "good and faithful servant"<br>
I want to hear You say, "I've prepared a place for you"<br>
Let all the treasures of this world<br>
Fade away<br>
<br>
Jesus, You are my reward<br>
To hear Your voice on that day<br>
Is all I'm living for<br>
Jesus, You are my reward<br>
To see Your face on that day<br>
Is all I'm living for<br>
<br>
I want to hear You say, words to me, "well done"<br>
I want to hear You say, "good and faithful servant"<br>
I want to hear You say, "I've prepared a place for you"<br>
Lord, let all the treasures of this world<br>
Fade away<br>
<br>
Jesus, You are my reward<br>
To hear Your voice on that day<br>
Is all I'm living for<br>
Jesus, You are my reward<br>
To see Your face on that day<br>
Is all I'm living for<br>
<br>
Jesus, all I'm living for<br>
<br>
Lord Jesus, You are my reward<br>
<br>
Jesus, all I'm living for<br>

<a name="JAH29SAULLTRSFEM"></a><h2>Paul & Women</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Paul & Women<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 14:40 (KJV)<br>
Let all things be done decently and in order.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 14:33 (KJV)<br>
For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: There was a random moment in Christian Essays 4 when we were talking about what a church community would look like if everything was being done decently and in order. If everyone was studying and obeying his or her Bible, as individuals, together as a married couple, together as a family, together as a group of believers, then the people would be in alignment and agreement with what the Bible says and describes. When people do not, then you will start to see more like the opposite of what the Bible describes as a proper church service or fellowship gathering.<br>
<br>
Paul wrote a series of letters to the new Christian churches, trying to give them some advice and suggestions on how operate and manage the meetings, and how to deal with the spiritual attacks that satan may try to do, in his effort to try to break-up or prevent a church from being successful.<br>
<br>
One of Paul's comments was how women are supposed to be silent during a meeting. In another letter that one of Paul's students wrote to Timothy, another one of Paul's students, this letter to Timothy also repeats Paul's comment.<br>
<br>
The letters to Timothy also give advice to the new and developing Christian church meetings and gatherings.<br>
<br>
I don't like him saying that about women. It annoys me that he said that. Maybe, Paul recently went to a meeting or gathering and perhaps there happened to be a woman that was overly talkative at the meeting, that kept having to interrupt and over-contribute to the meeting with her comments, insights and questions, causing the meeting or Bible study to carry on longer than normal, due to her frequent contributions.<br>
<br>
The Bible does not record or document any of that. I imagine that, after the meeting, Paul left, and travelled from new fellowship to new fellowship, from city to city, and he wrote letters to help the newly developed Christian churches deal with their challenges.  There are probably many conversations that he had with them, face-to-face, that we do have written or documented anywhere, and he probably wrote many more letters besides the ones that we have in our Bibles, other letters that we do not have anymore.<br>
<br>
This means that we do not have the full story behind why he says what he says, and why he gives theses opinions and comments in the few letters that we do have in our Bible. There were letters before and after these, and conversations before and these letters, that we do not know about.<br>
<br>
Here were some of the verses that we looked at when we were studying this, back in Christian Essays 4...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 14 (KJV) -- verses 33, 34 and 35<br>
33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.<br>
34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.<br>
35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 14 (NLT) -- verses 33, 34 and 35<br>
33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the meetings of God's holy people.<br>
(As in all the meetings of God's holy people, women should be silent during the church meetings.)<br>
34 Women should be silent during the church meetings. It is not proper for them to speak. They should be submissive, just as the law says.<br>
35 If they have any questions, they should ask their husbands at home, for it is improper for women to speak in church meetings.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2 (KJV) -- verses 11 and 12<br>
11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.<br>
12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2 (NLT) -- verses 11 and 12<br>
11 Women should learn quietly and submissively.<br>
12 I do not let women teach men or have authority over them. (I do not let women teach men or usurp their authority.) Let them listen quietly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, in a random area, not very far down into Christian Essays 4, those verses were also studied at that time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1 Corinthians, chapter 7, when Paul gives some Instruction on Marriage,<br>
he inserts this verse into there...<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 7:6 (KJV)<br>
But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 7:6 (NLT and TS2009)<br>
I say this as a concession, not as a command.<br>
<br>
This little verse right there that we just read, 1 Corinthians 7:6, is very important.<br>
Paul is reminding us, that these are comments, not commandments. Paul does reference and even quote some Bible verses, and then the rest of his letters are comments and advice on how to deal with the issues that he was made aware of, what he happened to notice when he was there, or the problems that he was told about.<br>
<br>
Let me repeat to you some of the comments I had back in Christian Essays 4.<br>
They are letters.<br>
They are not laws and commandments spoken by God and given to Moses in the Old Testament.<br>
They are not laws and commandments spoken by God and given to Jesus in the New Testament.<br>
They are letters. Since they are letters giving advice and having comments by Paul,<br>
it sounds like Paul was annoyed by a loud woman that would not stop talking the last time he was at their gathering.<br>
These are only comments, suggestions and ideas to consider when starting a new church.<br>
They are not to be held up as high as Torah Law and Commandments.<br>
He does quote and reference some Torah laws in some places in his letters.<br>
<br>
This is a Bible study about Paul and Women, since Paul had this comment about women.<br>
We are going to talk about Paul's letters for a moment, and then we will talk about some of the famous women in the Bible.<br>
These women that we will look at here, in a moment, did not follow Paul's advice. They were not silent. They are heroes in the Bible.<br>
They saved lives. They stopped wars. They killed enemies. They made a difference, forever. They were not silent. They said words that were so important, that their words are forever recorded in our Bibles.<br>
<br>
First, let's do a short summary about the letters that Paul wrote, which are in our Bible.<br>
<br>
To help us do this quickly, we will be quoting some words from the<br>
King James Version with Apocrypha, American Edition<br>
Published by the American Bible Society.<br>
They took the <br>
King James Version 1611 Bible,<br>
then they made adjustments to the spelling, punctuation and text formatting in 1962;<br>
and then they created an introduction to each book.<br>
We will be quoting a few parts from the introductions that they had about Paul's letters.<br>
Their final product was released in 2010 by the American Bible Society.<br>
<br>
First of all, we have letters that we know for sure were written by Paul.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans: The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans was written around a.d. 58 by Paul to the church at Rome, a congregation composed of both Jewish and Gentile Christians. Paul writes this letter because he is planning to visit them.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians: Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians is one of the numerous letters the apostle wrote to churches to provide them with his valued theological and practical counsel. It was sent to the congregation he had organised in the southern Greek city of Corinth in the early 50s a.d.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians: 2 Corinthians, like Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, was written by the apostle to the church he had recently organised in the southern Greek port city of Corinth. Paul knew in writing this later letter that his earlier correspondence had not fully resolved the issues he had there addressed. And he knew that certain persons had since come to the congregation questioning Paul's authority and right to be called an apostle.<br>
<br>
Galatians: Galatians is addressed "unto the churches of Galatia," a region in central Asia Minor. The tone of the letter is defensive and combative, and in it Paul's emotions are running high.<br>
<br>
Ephesians: Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians is most likely a circular letter intended to be read in many churches in western Asia Minor, not just in Ephesus.<br>
<br>
Philippians: Paul had been involved in establishing the church in Philippi and this letter reveals many signs of his deep affection for his Philippian friends. From chapter 1, it is clear that Paul is writing from prison.<br>
<br>
Colossians: The church here was not started by Paul, but apparently by Epaphras who was with Paul in prison when this letter was written.<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians: Paul's First Epistle to the Thessalonians is believed to be the earliest letter of Paul to be preserved, making it the oldest document collected in the New Testament.<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians: This letter was written much later than Paul's First Epistle to the Thessalonians but it echoes the style and much of the subject matter of that earlier letter to this Macedonian church. That the return of Christ has still not happened seems to be difficult for some Thessalonians to deal with.<br>
<br>
Philemon: This letter addressed to a man named Philemon is a very short letter of only twenty-five verses. It was written to him by Paul whilst the apostle was imprisoned, perhaps in Ephesus where Paul lived from a.d. 54 to 56.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And then we have these Bible books that may or may not have been written by Paul.<br>
We may not be one hundred per cent certain about the author. There is some argument and debate about who wrote the following Bible books, which were originally letters.<br>
Once again, we are quoting a few sentences from the Bible book introductions created in 2010 by the American Bible Society.<br>
The introductions are found at the start of each book in their publication of the King James Version with Apocrypha, American Edition.<br>
<br>
The book of Hebrews: No author's name is mentioned in the text of the Book of Hebrews, and by default some authorities in the Early Church attributed it to Paul. The KJV follows that attribution, and assumes it is written by Paul, but there is no evidence clearly identifying the author.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy:  Some have proposed that the author here is likely a disciple of Paul who writes in Paul's more authoritative name. Differences in language, style, and vocabulary have also been noted, but the issue of authorship is virtually impossible to resolve.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy: This letter, like 1 Timothy, is addressed to Timothy, who had been Paul's assistant on mission journeys and later trained to be a pastor on his own. It includes affectionate language and Paul's reflections on Timothy's upbringing, giving it a more intimate and personal tone than the first letter. Therefore, 2 Timothy may have been written by Paul.<br>
<br>
Titus: As with 1 and 2 Timothy, the letter's concern over church organisation matters -- a concern that only became crucial in the era following Paul's death -- has led some to suggest that Titus was likely written by a disciple of Paul claiming the apostle's authority.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And that is the end of us quoting out of the introductions written in 2010 by the American Bible Society.<br>
<br>
So-called Christians that do not want to change, and do not want to obey the Bible, those kind of people like to read the following verse.<br>
Then they close their Bible, walk away, and stay exactly the same.<br>
<br>
Romans 6:14 (KJV)<br>
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Bible has more than one sentence in it.<br>
The Bible has more than one book in it.  It has 66 books, and it used to have even more books than that, originally.<br>
Romans 6:14 is one sentence from a letter from Paul.<br>
Paul said much more than that in what became the book of Romans.<br>
If people would read all of the book of Romans, and not just that one sentence, they would have found out that Paul also said the verses that we will read here next.<br>
Pulling a single, lonely sentence out of its context can be risky and may be subject to mis-interpretation.<br>
That's why, when you're not sure, you should read the verse around the single, quoted verse, or even read the entire chapter that it came from, so you don't misunderstand the message being communicated.<br>
If you want to quote some single verses from the book of Romans, don't just quote the greasy grace of Romans 6:14.<br>
Here are some more for you.  Same book.  Same author.<br>
<br>
Romans 2:13 (KJV)<br>
for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.<br>
<br>
Romans 3:31 (KJV)<br>
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.<br>
<br>
Romans 7:12 (KJV)<br>
Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.<br>
<br>
(Romans) 7:12 (TS2009)<br>
So that the Torah truly is set-apart, and the command set-apart, and righteous, and good.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 7:22 (KJV)<br>
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:<br>
<br>
(Romans) 7:22 (TS2009)<br>
For I delight in the Torah of Elohim according to the inward man,<br>
<br>
(Romans) 7:25 (TS2009)<br>
...I myself truly serve the Torah of Elohim....<br>
<br>
Romans 7:25 (KJV)<br>
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God....<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 3-5 (KJV)<br>
...God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:<br>
4 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<br>
5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 3-10 (NLT)<br>
3 The law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature.<br>
(The law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our flesh.)<br>
So God did what the law could not do. He sent his own Son in a body like the bodies we sinners have. And in that body God declared an end to sin's control over us by giving his Son as a sacrifice for our sins.<br>
4 He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit.<br>
5 Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit.<br>
6 So letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace.<br>
7 For the sinful nature is always hostile to God. It never did obey God's laws, and it never will.<br>
8 That's why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God.<br>
9 But you are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all.)<br>
(And Christ lives within you, so even though your body will die because of sin, your spirit is alive.)<br>
10 And Christ lives within you, so even though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life because you have been made right with God.<br>
<br>

Commentary: The book of Titus was more likely written by one of Paul's students.<br>
<br>
Titus 3:14 (KJV)<br>
And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.<br>
<br>
Titus 3:14 (NLT)<br>
Our people must learn to do good by meeting the urgent needs of others; then they will not be unproductive.<br>
<br>
Colossians 3:6 (KJV)<br>
...the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:<br>
<br>
<br>
So again, the verse of greasy grace that let's us slip and slide right into Heaven...<br>
<br>
Romans 6:14 (KJV)<br>
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.<br>
<br>
But what about Torah commandment obedience?<br>
Did Paul also teach about that?<br>
He sure did! Check this out...<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's read an interesting magazine article, found at the Herbert W Armstrong Library.<br>
Magazine Article. Title: The Apostle Paul - Commandment Breaker, or Commandment Keeper?<br>
A commentary written by Eugene M Walter.<br>
Published in Tomorrow's World Magazine, the January 1972 issue, Volume 4, Issue Number 1.<br>
available on the internet at this web address...<br>
<a href="https://www.hwalibrary.com/cgi-bin/get/hwa.cgi?action=getmagazine&InfoID=1328962995">https://www.hwalibrary.com/cgi-bin/get/hwa.cgi?action=getmagazine&InfoID=1328962995</a><br>
<br>
Here is a quotation from this 1972 article...<br>
<br>
Now what are some of Paul's clear statements about the Ten Commandments? One such statement is found in I Corinthians 6:9-10. Paul warns: "BE NOT DECEIVED, neither fornicators, nor IDOLATERS nor ADULTERERS ... nor THIEVES nor COVETOUS nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."<br>
<br>
In this one short passage the Apostle Paul names the breaking of FOUR of the Ten Commandments -- idolatry, adultery, stealing and coveting -- and dogmatically states that any found guilty of breaking these commandments will not inherit God's Kingdom! And he sternly warns us not to deceive ourselves by thinking otherwise!<br>
<br>
Notice another unmistakably clear and easy-to-understand passage: "Now the works of the flesh ... are these: ADULTERY, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, IDOLATRY ... wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, MURDERS, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things SHALL NOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD" (Galatians 5:19-21).<br>
<br>
This passage repeats two commandments -- those pertaining to adultery and idolatry -- and adds one more -- the command against MURDER.<br>
<br>
This makes a total of FIVE commandments which Paul has specifically and unequivocally stated Christians must keep if they are to inherit or enter God's Kingdom. And since idolatry, which is mentioned in both of these passages, automatically breaks the first commandment, which is "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3), Paul has actually commanded obedience to six of the Ten Commandments in just TWO SHORT PASSAGES!<br>
<br>
Now turn to Colossians 3:5-9. This passage reads: "Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and COVETOUSNESS, which is IDOLATRY: For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of DISOBEDIENCE ... But now ye also PUT OFF ALL THESE: anger, wrath, malice, BLASPHEMY, FILTHY COMMUNICATION OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. LIE NOT one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds."<br>
<br>
This scripture names and CONDEMNS disobedience to TWO MORE of the Ten Commandments -- BEARING FALSE WITNESS or LYING and TAKING GOD'S NAME IN VAIN through BLASPHEMY and FILTHY TALK. (See also Ephesians 4:29.)<br>
<br>
Next open your Bible to Ephesians 6:1-2. Here we read, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. HONOUR THY FATHER AND MOTHER; which is the FIRST COMMANDMENT WITH PROMISE." This is a direct quote from the commandment in Exodus 20:12. Yet here Paul explicitly COMMANDS Christians to OBEY it!<br>
<br>
This makes a total of NINE commandments which Paul has distinctly and separately named as being binding on Christians. Only the Sabbath command is left. Let's see what Paul taught about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Every argument imaginable has been advanced against the command to keep holy the day God made holy (Exodus 20:8). Some want to use time as they please. They don't want God telling them what to do! Some hate this command more than any other, it seems. It is the "test commandment" to show who God's people really are.<br>
<br>
Did Paul obey this commandment? Did he personally keep the day God made holy -- and did he teach others to obey it? Let's not just guess or assume. Let's examine the Scriptures and "prove all things."<br>
<br>
In Acts 13 we have the account of Paul and Barnabas coming to Antioch in Pisidia. There they "went into the synagogue ON THE SABBATH DAY, and sat down. And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on" (Acts 13:14-15).<br>
<br>
Then Paul stood up and spoke, preaching Christ to them. "And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the GENTILES besought that these words might be preached to them THE NEXT SABBATH" (verse 42)<br>
<br>
Now since Paul was preaching "the GRACE of God" (verse 43), here was his opportunity to straighten out these Gentiles. Notice what Paul did.<br>
<br>
"And the NEXT SABBATH DAY came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God" (verse 44). Here Paul waited a whole week in order to preach to the Gentiles upon the day God made holy!<br>
<br>
But this is not the only passage showing that Paul obeyed this commandment.<br>
<br>
In Acts 18:1-11 there is the account of Paul living with Aquila and Priscilla for one and one-half years (verse 11). During this time we read that he "reasoned in the synagogue EVERY SABBATH, and persuaded the Jews AND THE GREEKS" (verse 4).<br>
<br>
Notice it! This New Testament passage tells us that Paul laboured the six working days and taught in the synagogue EVERY SABBATH for ONE AND ONE-HALF YEARS!<br>
<br>
Likewise in Acts 17:2, Paul "AS HIS MANNER WAS went in unto them, and three SABBATH DAYS reasoned with them out of the scriptures."<br>
<br>
It was Paul's MANNER -- his CUSTOM -- to keep God's day holy. Did he follow Christ in this? Certainly! Jesus, "AS HIS CUSTOM WAS ... went into the synagogue ON THE SABBATH DAY" (Luke 4:16).<br>
<br>
<br>
That is the end of the quotation from a commentary written by Eugene M Walter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Many of you may already know that a synagogue is a building where Jews, Jewish people, meet to worship or to study the Jewish religion known as Judaism, meeting at that building for religious worship and religious instruction.<br>
<br>
As Eugene M Walter pointed out in his article, in the book of Acts, chapters 13, 17 and 18, Paul taught in the synagogue on every Sabbath. So, he taught on the importance of Nine of the Ten Commandments, and he apparently did not need to teach on the importance of obeying the Sabbath commandment, because everybody in the audience was already doing it.  He did that one, keeping the Sabbath, by his example of how he lived, being a role-model of doing the Sabbath, by the way he was already living. It would be like you or me being a pastor, and going up to the microphone during a Christian church service on Sunday, and doing a sermon on why you go to church on Sunday. Everyone in the room is already doing that, so why would you be teaching that if everyone in the room is already doing that? Maybe that is why Paul did not feel the need to touch on that topic, because his audience had that one down already, and Paul was living it out as an example to begin with.<br> 
<br>
So, to summarise what we learnt from that magazine article, Paul, pointing directly to nine of the Ten Commandments in his letters, was obviously telling us not to disobey these commandments. He was teaching that, those who disobey these commandments will not be inheriting the kingdom of God. That means, you're not going to heaven if keep doing these evil things which are in direct opposition and disobedience of Yaw-Who-Wah's Torah. It can be really hard to understand Paul and his letters, especially if people choose not to actually read them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Bible tells us that Paul's letters can have some parts which are hard to understand, and may be subject to mis-interpretation, and might be used improperly by evil people, in order to destroy your relationship with God and with fellow believers.<br>
The Bible gives us a warning about Paul's letters.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3:16 (NLT)<br>
...Some of (Paul's) comments are hard to understand, and those who are ignorant and unstable have twisted his letters to mean something quite different, just as they do with other parts of Scripture. And this will result in their destruction.<br>
<br>
We are targeting verse 16, but let's enjoy some of the verses around it whilst we are here.<br>
Let's zoom out a bit, start at verse 15 in the KJV, fly over the targeted verse 16, and land at verse 18.<br>
Then we will zoom out a bit farther, and do another fly-over in the NLT and in the TS2009, so we can enjoy the meaning, and also enjoy His name in Hebrew.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3: 15-18 (KJV)<br>
15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;<br>
16 as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.<br>
17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.<br>
18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3: 9-18 (NLT)<br>
9 The Lord isn't really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent.<br>
10 But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and the very elements themselves will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgement.<br>
(the earth and everything on it will be burned up.)<br>
(the earth and everything on it will be found destroyed.)<br>
<br>
11 Since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this, what holy and godly lives you should live,<br>
12 looking forward to the day of God and hurrying it along. On that day, he will set the heavens on fire, and the elements will melt away in the flames.<br>
13 But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world filled with God's righteousness.<br>
14 And so, dear friends, whilst you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.<br>
15 And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved. This is what our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom God gave him --<br>
16 speaking of these things in all of his letters. Some of his comments are hard to understand, and those who are ignorant and unstable have twisted his letters to mean something quite different, just as they do with other parts of Scripture. And this will result in their destruction.<br>
17 You already know these things, dear friends. So be on guard; then you will not be carried away by the errors of these wicked people and lose your own secure footing.<br>
18 Rather, you must grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<br>
All glory to him, both now and forever! Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3: 9-18 (TS2009)<br>
9 Yaw-Who-Wah is not slow in regard to the promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward us, not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.<br>
10 But the day of Yaw-Who-Wah shall come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with intense heat, and the earth and the works that are in it shall be burned up.<br>
11 Seeing all these are to be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be in set-apart behaviour and reverence,<br>
12 looking for and hastening the coming of the day of Elohim, through which the heavens shall be destroyed, being set on fire, and the elements melt with intense heat!<br>
13 But according to His promise we wait for a renewed heavens and a renewed earth in which righteousness dwells.<br>
14 So then, beloved ones, looking forward to this, do your utmost to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless,<br>
15 and reckon the patience of our Master as deliverance, as also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom given to him,<br>
16 as also in all his letters, speaking in them concerning these matters, in which some are hard to understand, which those who are untaught and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do also the other Scriptures.<br>
17 You, then, beloved ones, being forewarned, watch, lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being led away with the delusion of the lawless,<br>
18 but grow in the favour and knowledge of our (Lord) Master and Saviour Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah (Muh-She-Uck). To Him be the esteem both now and to a day that abides. Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Taking a single Bible verse, yanking it out of its context, and quoting it all by itself, can sometimes be a dangerous thing to do.<br>
It depends on the verse.  Sometimes they can stand alone and be just fine. Sometimes, they can be misunderstood when they are not surrounded by the verses before and after them, and the chapters before and after them.<br>
<br>
Satan knows this, and he can use this as a trick to lead us astray.<br>
<br>
Satan loves to twist, tweak, and mis-quote Scripture out of context.<br>
Remember his very first quoted words?<br>
<br>
Genesis 3:1 (KJV)<br>
Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Satan's first words in the Bible are in the form of a question.<br>
He questions the Word of God.  Take that little dot at the end of each sentence in your Bible and turn every one of them into a question mark.<br>
That's what satan does.<br>
Did God really say that?  Is that what He really meant?<br>
Question God's law, question his authority.<br>
Have doubts, which lead to quarrellings, arguing, discussion, debate, Mid-Rash, (that Hebrew word is not found in the Bible, and the Bible never tells us to do Mid-Rash, because Mid-Rash will lead to quarrellings, arguing, discussion, debate,) discord, strife, contention, fellowship separation, divorce, apostacy, falling away, salvation rejection, and, congratulations, you have become another one of Satan's trophies in Hell, forever.<br>
How do you thwart the wiles of the devil? How do you put a stop to his schemes and strategies?<br>
Put on the armour, and pray, Submit to God, resist the devil, and he will go away.<br>
<br>
James 4:7 (KJV)<br>
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
<br>
Step 1. Submit to God! You have to do Step 1 before you can do Step 2.<br>
<br>
Satan also tried that out-of-context Bible mis-quoting trick with Jesus.<br>
<br>
Matthew 4<br>
The Temptation of Jesus<br>
1. Turn stones into bread (Matthew 4:3)<br>
2. Jump from the pinnacle of the temple so the angels could save Him (Matthew 4:6)<br>
3. Bow down and worship the devil in exchange for power (Matthew 4:8-9)<br>
Satan just wanted Jesus to do something just for himself, selfishly, but Jesus never did anything just for himself, selfishly.<br>
Everything Jesus did, He did for others, and never for himself. That is how Jesus lived, and that is how we should live as well.<br>
<br>
Every time satan gave a Bible verse mis-quote out of context as an excuse to sin, Jesus always responded with a proper Bible quote that cancelled out satan's deception.<br>
That is how Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, stopped satan, and that's how you can too!<br>
<br>
Just because someone says something in a YouTube or Bitchute video, does not mean that what they said was true.<br>
If what someone says is not true, then there will not be any Bible verse to support that person's statement.<br>
That sure sounds good, but can you now quote the Bible verse that says what you just said?<br>
The Bible, the Torah, is the way, the truth and the life, and it became flesh and dwelt among us.<br>
Again, The Bible, the Torah, is the way, the truth and the life.<br>
Not in the Bible could be the wrong way, a lie, and the sin that leads to death.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:12 -- There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>
<br>
After The Temptation of Jesus, later in Matthew chapter 4, The Ministry of Jesus Begins.<br>
Maybe there is something there for us to learn so that your Ministry and my Ministry can truly begin, and be made to advance and be taken to the next level.<br>
<br>
So, we just saw in that magazine article that Paul really did tell us in his letters that disobeying the Torah's Ten Commandments will cause you to not go to heaven.<br>
Trying to walk on nothing but grease can make you slip and fall!<br>
<br>
Since Paul's comment about women is what got us starting to talk about Paul and his letters, let's now take a look at some of the famous women in the Bible.<br>
<br>
We will now quote some sentences from a website by Elizabeth Fletcher.<br>
<br>
The website is titled, Bible Women.<br>
It is found at womeninthebible.net -- a website by Elizabeth Fletcher.<br>
Her webpage, Bible Women Heroines, has a list of famous women in the Bible.<br>
The list was located at the following web address back in March of 2022.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.womeninthebible.net/bible-women-heroines/">http://www.womeninthebible.net/bible-women-heroines/</a><br>
<br>
Elizabeth Fletcher also published a paper book, titled, Women in the Bible.<br>
The book, Women in the Bible, was published by Harper Collins in 1997.<br>
<br>
This list of women could be much longer than it is.<br>
These are not all of the women in the Bible that did great and amazing things.<br>
There are more than just these women being mentioned here.<br>
<br>
Here are some short notes about some of the famous women in the Bible.<br>
These are small quotations from the womeninthebible.net website as it was back in March of 2022.<br>
Each woman had her own, individual webpage, telling her story, and it was from each of those individual webpages that we are quoting a small portion to remind us about each of these women, who they were, and what they did.<br>
We will also mention the location in the Bible where you can go to read about each woman, and read her story for yourself.<br>
<br>
Mary Magdalene -- a follower of Jesus of Nazareth. He cured her of an unknown illness. -- Luke 8:1-3<br>
<br>
Sarah -- Abraham's wife, matriarch of the tribes of Israel, their founding mother. -- Genesis 11 & 12<br>
<br>
Ruth -- A young Moabite woman who stayed faithful to her Israelite mother-in-law through every sort of trouble.<br>
She was rewarded for her loyalty when the mother-in-law, Naomi, showed her how to win a rich and loving husband, Boaz. -- Ruth 1 & 2<br>
<br>
Naomi -- Naomi takes a hand in matters and instructs Ruth on how to catch her man. Ruth and Boaz marry, and Naomi has a grandson. Book of Ruth 3 & 4<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rahab -- Rahab the prostitute hid three Hebrew spies. She then helped them escape. In return, they promised that when Jericho was attacked, Rahab and her family would be spared. --  (Joshua 2 & Joshua 6)<br>
<br>
Abigail, a wife of King David -- David needs food for his men.  Abigail gives them food, and then marries David. -- 1 Samuel 25<br>
<br>
Hannah -- Hannah is childless. If she has a son, she will dedicate him as a Nazarite. Hannah prays and then has a son, Samuel. -- 1 Samuel, chapters 1 & 2<br>
<br>
Miriam -- During a time when all male babies were ordered to be thrown into the Nile river, the sister of Baby Moses, Miriam, saved his life by hiding him amongst the reeds at the edge of the Nile river. Baby Moses was then found by Pharaoh's own daughter, who adopted him.<br>
Cleverly, Miriam arranged it so that the real mother of the baby should be hired to breastfeed the baby.<br>
A mother being paid to breastfeed her own baby! That's what Miriam did. -- Exodus 2<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rachel -- Rachel met Jacob at the well. He fell passionately in love with her. Rachel gave birth to Joseph and Benjamin. These were two of the twelve sons of Jacob which were the forefathers of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. --  Genesis chapters 29, 30 and 35.<br>
<br>
Rebecca,  -- Marries Isaac. Rebecca gives birth to twin sons, Esau and Jacob. (Genesis chapters 24 through 27)<br>
<br>
Deborah,  -- When war came, Deborah took up the reins of leadership – even though the Israelites were outnumbered and under-equipped.<br>
The enemy had hundreds of iron-wheeled chariots that could crush the Israelites into the ground. But Deborah tricked them into driving these chariots onto marshy land where they were bogged down. With them being stuck, the Israelite slingmen and archers picked them off one by one.<br>
And then, Sisera, the enemy general, fled from the battlefield towards the encampment of a woman called Jael the Kenite. -- Judges, chapters 4 and 5<br>
<br>
Jael -- When Sisera, the enemy general, passed by Jael's tent, Jael called the unwary Sisera into her tent.<br>
She hid him and fed him, and when he fell asleep, she killed him, by driving a tent peg through his head as he slept. -- Judges, chapters 4 and 5<br>
<br>
Mary -- Mary of Nazareth, a virgin that became the Mother of Jesus. Her story is found in the books of Mathew, Mark, Luke and John, especially in the first few chapters of each of those books.<br>
<br>
And the last woman that we will mention, is...<br>
The Samaritan woman at the well -- Her name is not mentioned. Jesus and his disciples stop at a roadside well. He meets a Samaritan woman.<br>
She questions him boldly and becomes convinced he is the Messiah.<br>
She goes back to her town where she tells everyone about Jesus so that they became believers too.<br>
Her story is in John chapter 4.<br>
<br>
And that concludes our look at Elizabeth Fletcher's list of famous women in the Bible.<br>
<br>
We now end this Bible study with a quick prayer.<br>
<br>
Dear Lord Jesus,<br>
Dear Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
Help us understand and extract your good wisdom and instruction from Paul's letters and from all of the books of the Bible.<br>
Help us attend and have fellowship gatherings and Bible studies and Torah studies, and help us have them all be done decently and in order.<br>
May we not be silent when you want us to speak. May we keep our mouth shut when some things are better left unsaid.<br>
May all of us, men and women, boys and girls, be bold, brave and courageous, and may we speak and take action all according to your good, pleasing and perfect will.<br>
In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main. In Jesus' name, Amen.<br>
