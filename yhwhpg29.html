Rescue<br>
<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 5:11 (TS2009)<br>
But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; Let them ever shout for joy, because You shelter them; And let those who love Your Name exult in You.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Isaiah) 25:4 (TS2009)<br>
For You shall be a refuge to the poor, a refuge to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat....<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalm 61:3 (KJV)<br>
For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalm 61: 2-4 -- NLT <br>
2<br>
From the ends of the earth,<br>
I cry to you for help<br>
when my heart is overwhelmed.<br>
Lead me to the towering rock of safety,<br>
3<br>
for you are my safe refuge,<br>
a fortress where my enemies cannot reach me.<br>
4<br>
Let me live forever in your sanctuary,<br>
safe beneath the shelter of your wings!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 18:10 (KJV)<br>
The name of the LORD is a strong tower: The righteous runneth into it, and is safe.<br>
(The righteous runneth into it, and is set aloft.)<br>
<br>
Proverbs 18:10 (NLT)<br>
The name of the Lord is a strong fortress; the godly run to him and are safe.<br>
<br>
(Proverbs) 18:10 (TS2009)<br>
The Name of Yaw-Who-Wah is a strong tower; The righteous run into it and are safe.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Jeremiah) 17:17 (TS2009)<br>
...You are my shelter in the day of evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: It seems that the KJV translation team only used the word, "rescue," three times in the KJV Bible that we have today.<br>
The NLT team liked using the word, Rescue, so we see it being used a lot more in the NLT.<br>
There are several occasions, especially in the book of Psalms, where someone is praying and asking God, which, in Hebrew, would be, EE-Low-Heem,<br>
asking Him to please rescue me.<br>
But there are also some verses where the Lord tells us, I will rescue you.<br>
Let's find several of those verses where the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, tells us in the Bible that He is going to rescue us.<br>
Since the word, Rescue, is mainly found in the NLT, we will be mainly quoting Bible verses from the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 18:27 (NLT)<br>
You rescue the humble, but you humiliate the proud.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 22:28 (NLT)<br>
You rescue the humble, but your eyes watch the proud and humiliate them.<br>
<br>
Psalms 33: 18-21 (KJV)<br>
33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;<br>
33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.<br>
33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.<br>
33:21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 33: 9-22 (NLT)<br>
9<br>
For when he spoke, the world began!<br>
It appeared at his command.<br>
10<br>
The Lord frustrates the plans of the nations<br>
and thwarts all their schemes.<br>
11<br>
But the Lord's plans stand firm forever;<br>
his intentions can never be shaken.<br>
12<br>
What joy for the nation whose God is the Lord,<br>
whose people he has chosen as his inheritance.<br>
13<br>
The Lord looks down from heaven<br>
and sees the whole human race.<br>
14<br>
From his throne he observes<br>
all who live on the earth.<br>
15<br>
He made their hearts,<br>
so he understands everything they do.<br>
16<br>
The best-equipped army cannot save a king,<br>
nor is great strength enough to save a warrior.<br>
17<br>
Don't count on your warhorse to give you victory --<br>
for all its strength, it cannot save you.<br>
18<br>
But the Lord watches over those who fear him,<br>
those who rely on his unfailing love.<br>
19<br>
He rescues them from death<br>
and keeps them alive in times of famine.<br>
20<br>
We put our hope in the Lord.<br>
He is our help and our shield.<br>
21<br>
In him our hearts rejoice,<br>
for we trust in his holy name.<br>
22<br>
Let your unfailing love surround us, Lord,<br>
for our hope is in you alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 33: 9-22 (TS2009)<br>
9 For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood fast.<br>
10 Yaw-Who-Wah brings the counsel of the nations to naught; He thwarts the plans of the peoples.<br>
11 The counsel of Yaw-Who-Wah stands forever, The plans of His heart to all generations.<br>
12 Blessed is the nation whose Elohim is Yaw-Who-Wah, The people whom He has chosen as His own inheritance.<br>
13 Yaw-Who-Wah has looked from the heavens; He has seen all the sons of men.<br>
14 He looked from His dwelling place On all the inhabitants of the earth --<br>
15 He who fashions the hearts of them all, He who understands all their works.<br>
16 The sovereign is not saved by the multitude of an army; A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.<br>
17 A horse is a vain means of safety; Neither does it rescue any by its great power.<br>
18 See, the eye of Yaw-Who-Wah is on those fearing Him, On those waiting for His loving-commitment,<br>
19 To deliver their being from death, And to keep them alive during scarcity of food.<br>
20 Our being has longed for Yaw-Who-Wah; Our help and our shield is He.<br>
21 For our heart does rejoice in Him, For we have put our trust in His set-apart Name.<br>
22 Let Your loving-commitment, O Yaw-Who-Wah, be upon us, Even as we wait for You.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34: 17-19 (NLT)<br>
17<br>
The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.<br>
He rescues them from all their troubles.<br>
18<br>
The Lord is close to the broken-hearted;<br>
he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.<br>
19<br>
The righteous person faces many troubles,<br>
but the Lord comes to the rescue each time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37: 39 & 40 (NLT)<br>
39<br>
The Lord rescues the godly;<br>
he is their fortress in times of trouble.<br>
40<br>
The Lord helps them,<br>
rescuing them from the wicked.<br>
He saves them,<br>
and they find shelter in him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37: 39 & 40 (TS2009)<br>
39 But the deliverance of the righteous is from Yaw-Who-Wah, Their strength in time of distress.<br>
40 And Yaw-Who-Wah does help them and deliver them; He delivers them from the wrongdoers and saves them, Because they took refuge in Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 72: 12-14 (KJV)<br>
72:12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.<br>
72:13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.<br>
72:14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 72: 11-14 (NLT)<br>
11<br>
All kings will bow before him,<br>
and all nations will serve him.<br>
12<br>
He will rescue the poor when they cry to him;<br>
he will help the oppressed, who have no one to defend them.<br>
13<br>
He feels pity for the weak and the needy,<br>
and he will rescue them.<br>
14<br>
He will redeem them from oppression and violence,<br>
for their lives are precious to him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 91: 2 & 3 (NLT)<br>
2<br>
This I declare about the Lord:<br>
He alone is my refuge, my place of safety;<br>
he is my God, and I trust him.<br>
3<br>
For he will rescue you from every trap<br>
and protect you from deadly disease.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 91: 2 & 3 (TS2009)<br>
2 He is saying of Yaw-Who-Wah, "My refuge and my stronghold, My Elohim, in whom I trust!"<br>
3 For He delivers you from the snare of a trapper, From the destructive pestilence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 17: 37-39 (NLT)<br>
37 Be careful at all times to obey the decrees, regulations, instructions, and commands that he wrote for you. You must not worship other gods.<br>

<br>
<br>

38 "And do not forget the covenant that I have made with you, and do not fear other mighty ones.<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 91: 14-16 (NLT)<br>
14<br>
The Lord says, "I will rescue those who love me.<br>

15<br>
When they call on me, I will answer;<br>
I will be with them in trouble.<br>
I will rescue and honour them.<br>

<br>
<br>

That comes from the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, which we read back in Christian Essays 4.<br>
Here is a little sample from that scene...<br>
<br>
Daniel 3: 16-18 (NLT)<br>
16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you.<br>
17 If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty.<br>
18 But even if he doesn't, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up."<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Daniel 6: 26 & 27 (NLT)<br>
...For he is the living God, and he will endure forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed, and his rule will never end.<br>
27 He rescues and saves his people; he performs miraculous signs and wonders in the heavens and on earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions."<br>

Zechariah 8: 6 & 7 (NLT)<br>
6 "This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: All this may seem impossible to you now, a small remnant of God's people. But is it impossible for me? says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
7 "This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: You can be sure that I will rescue my people from the east and from the west.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zechariah 8: 6 & 7 (TS2009)<br>
6 "Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat (The Lord of Hosts), 'If it is marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in My eyes?' declares Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat (The Lord of Hosts).<br>

<br>
Isaiah 7:15 (KJV)<br>
Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 7:15 (NLT)<br>
By the time this child is old enough to choose what is right and reject what is wrong, he will be eating (curds and) yogurt and honey.<br>
<br>
(Isaiah) 7:15 (TS2009)<br>
"He eats curds and honey when He knows to refuse evil and choose the good.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Yogurt can be spelled three different ways.<br>
1. In the United States, it is normally spelled, y o g u r t.<br>
2. In the United Kingdom, it may also be spelled with an H, like this, y o g h u r t.<br>
3. In some rare situations, it might be spelled with the H and an extra letter O, like this, y o g h o u r t.<br>
<br>
If you eat the Bible, that is, you let the Bible enter into you, then you may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.<br>
Then, studying and obeying the Bible will make you grow up and become mature enough to choose what is right and reject what is wrong.<br>
Babies do not know much about right and wrong because they are babies.<br>
Isaiah 7:15 is mentioning foods that only more mature children can digest.<br>
The honey from the rock, The Bible, is bad for babies because they are still being made to fall asleep by having only breastmilk for breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br>
Honey is bad for babies because it can have Clostridium botulinum, which can produce botulinum spores that secrete toxins.<br>
An infant's intestinal tract is not strong enough to fight off these spores and toxins, and it can lead to death for an infant.<br>
A baby Christian's never-reading-the-Bible intestinal tract is not strong enough to fight off spiritual attacks.<br>
A baby also cannot digest the enzymes and proteins in dairy products before his or her first birthday.<br>
<br>
<br>
If some Christians are like babies, and the Bible is like honey, and the promised land is a land flowing with milk and honey, then the spirit-filled life, the promised land, is not for babies.<br>
This picture of Christian maturity or immaturity is echoed in the Scriptures, and it tells us that,<br>
some people that do not want to grow up and become spiritually mature may have trouble digesting and processing the truth in the Bible, like eating the scroll that caused a sour tummy.<br>
<br>
Lord Jesus, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, help baby Christians going to baby-school churches, stuck on nothing but breastmilk, year after year after year,<br>
help them break away from baby patterns, and help them graduate to the honey in the Bible, to the solid foods and meats in Torah commandment obedience, so that they too will be wise enough to choose what is right and reject what is wrong.<br>
In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
My wife once asked an old man who had been going to the same baby-Christian-church for 65 years, Are you saved?<br>
His answer, again, an old man who had been going to the same church for 65 years, his answer was, I don't know.<br>
So, we opened up a can of Romans 10:9 and, well, we know he is saved now, and I'll be happy to introduce you to him when we get to heaven.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Are you not really sure about what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is evil, what is a sin, and what is not a sin?<br>
Read your entire Bible, from cover to cover.<br>
If you do, you will clearly know what is sin and what is not sin.<br>
If you do, you will clearly know what is right and what is wrong.<br>
If you do, you will clearly know what is good and what is evil.<br>
If you do, you will clearly know what is truth and what is a lie.<br>
<br>
You keep talking and singing to someone named, You. You are this and you are that?<br>
Who is this one that you keep referring to as, You?<br>
Are you able to put his actual name in a song, or are you going to just keep on singing to someone named, You?<br>
Someone you love? A lover? God? Is that it? God?<br>
Call upon His actual, real name.<br>
You keep saying, God.<br>
What so-called god are you talking about?<br>
God is a He. The Bible only says that God is a He.  The Heavenly Father, the Beloved Son, and the Spirit that is Holy, are all referred to as, He.<br>
Proverbs 30:4 was asking you and me a very important question. The question is this.<br>
What is His name, and what is His son's name? Are you able to tell me this?<br>
Can you tell me what the actual name of your God really is?<br>
Are you a Christian?  Are you saved?  Are you going to live forever in Heaven?<br>
This is a test.  Fortunately, this is an open-book test.<br>
But, like all tests, there is a time limit. When your body dies, your test gets turned in, and whatever you wrote down, if anything, and your answers become final, and the answers cannot be changed when your time is up.<br>
You can still change the answers now if any of them are wrong or missing.<br>

In Christian Essays 5, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 5,<br>
we mentioned the song, You Say, by Lauren Daigle.<br>
<br>
That song has been one of the most popular Christian songs for at least four solid years,<br>
from 2018 to the end of at least the year 2021.<br>
<br>
Take a look at the charts found on Billboard Magazine's website.<br>
<br>
Billboard Magazine's<br>
Year-End Charts of Hot Christian Songs<br>
The most popular Hot Christian Songs for the entire year, according to Billboard Magazine.<br>
2016: Number 2 is Trust In You by Lauren Daigle. Number 1 in 2016 was Oceans (Where Feet May Fail) by Hillsong United.<br>
2018: Number 2 is You Say by Lauren Daigle, Number 1 in 2018 was Reckless Love by Cory Asbury.<br>
2019: Number 1 for 2019 was You Say by Lauren Daigle.  The Number 4 most popular Hot Christian Song for 2019 was Rescue, by Lauren Daigle.<br>
2020: The Number 1 most popular, Hot Christian Song for 2020 was, again, You Say by Lauren Daigle.<br>
2021: And the Number 1 Hot Christian Song for all of 2021 was, once again, You Say by Lauren Daigle.<br>
<br>
So, You Say, was the most popular song for three straight years, 2019, 2020 and for 2021.<br><br>
We have looked at Bible verses and we read the words to that song in a Bible Study titled,<br>
You Say and The Bible Says<br>
which is found in Christian Essays 5, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 5.<br>
<br>
As mentioned just a moment ago, the Number 4 most popular Hot Christian Song for the entire year of 2019 was, Rescue, by Lauren Daigle.<br>
The song, Rescue, is a song by American contemporary Christian music singer and songwriter Lauren Daigle.<br>
It is the third single from her third studio album, Look Up Child.<br>
The album, Look Up Child, was released on 7 September 2018.<br>
"Rescue" was released to Christian radio and as a single on 12 July 2019 as the third single from the album, Look Up Child.<br>
It peaked at No. 2 on Billboard Magazine's Christian Songs chart and at No. 12 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100.<br>
The single was scheduled to be released to Hot Adult Contemporary Hit radio on 22 July 2019,<br>
but was actually released to Hot Adult Contemporary Hit radio on 19 August 2019.<br>
<br>
She also released a Spanish version and a quiet, more calm remix, called a Chill Mix.<br>
There is also, apparently, an unofficial slow dance remix made by someone else and released on YouTube.<br>
It is the Hydro Walkers Remix, and with its interesting harmonic additions, I would recommend that as a good remix to listen to.<br>
<br>
In the song that we are about to talk about here, in the words to the song, Rescue, there is a mention of something called, SOS.<br>
Although SOS, in popular usage, is an acronym commonly associated with phrases such as "Save Our Souls" and "Save Our Ship",<br>
originally, SOS is a Morse code distress signal.<br>
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardised sequences of two different signal durations,<br>
called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs.<br>
Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph. He was born in 1791, and he died in 1872.<br>
The American artist, inventor and painter Samuel Morse, the American physicist Joseph Henry, and mechanical engineer Alfred Vail developed an electrical telegraph system.<br>
It needed a method to transmit natural language using only patterns of electrical pulses and the silence between them, sent back and forth across a simple electric wire. Around 1837, Morse, therefore developed an early forerunner to the modern International Morse code.<br>
The Morse system for telegraphy, was used in about 1844.<br>
Even the name used today, AT&T, stands for American Telephone and Telegraph Company.<br>
The Western Union Company, used today for doing Wire transfers, Money orders and Money transfers, originally was known as the Western Union Telegraph Company.<br>
The electrical telegraph was a point-to-point text messaging system, used from the 1840s until the late 20th century when it was slowly replaced by other telecommunication systems.<br>
It was a way, back in 1832, to send messages across electric wires, before the invention of the telephone which was not until the year, 1876.<br>
It took many years after that for the telephone to eventually become as popular as the telegraph.<br>
Although commercial "telegraph" services are still available in many countries, transmission is usually done via a computer network rather than a dedicated wired connection.<br>
<br>
SOS is a distress signal that means, Save Our Ship, and that you are in need of being rescued.<br>
The pattern for the letter S, is long, long, long.<br>
The pattern for the letter O is short, short, short.<br>
So, as light, you can use a torch or flashlight.<br>
With some of the new torches or flashlights today, you can press the power button a few times, and it will automatically flash the SOS light pattern.<br>
You can also use a mirror and the reflection of the sun to signal the SOS light pattern.<br>
As light, the SOS pattern would be, quick flash, quick flash, quick flash, pause, long flash, long flash, long flash, pause, quick flash, quick flash, quick flash.<br>
If you were buried under something in an earthquake, and you could tap or bang on something loud so that people could find you,<br>
the SOS as a sound pattern would be, tap, tap, tap, pause, pause, -- tap, pause; tap, pause; tap, pause; -- pause, pause, tap, tap, tap.<br>
So, in summary, SOS is a Morse code distress signal, used when someone is marooned, trapped or stuck, and is in need of being rescued.<br>
The Lord promises to rescue us. Think again about all of those sweet-as-honey Bible verses that we just ate, where He says to you and to me, I will rescue you.<br>
<br>
From her 2018 album, Look Up Child, here are the words to the song, Rescue, by Lauren Daigle.<br>
<br>
<br>
You are not hidden<br>
There's never been a moment<br>
You were forgotten<br>
You are not hopeless<br>
Though you have been broken<br>
Your innocence stolen<br>
<br>
I hear you whisper underneath your breath<br>
I hear your SOS, your SOS<br>
<br>
I will send out an army<br>
To find you in the middle of the darkest<br>
Night, it's true,<br>
I will rescue you<br>
<br>
<br>
There is no distance<br>
That cannot be covered<br>
Over and over<br>
You're not defenceless<br>
I'll be your shelter<br>
I'll be your armour<br>
<br>
I hear you whisper underneath your breath<br>
I hear your SOS, your SOS<br>
<br>
I will send out an army<br>
To find you In the middle of the darkest<br>
Night, It's true, I will rescue you<br>
<br>
I will<br>
Never stop marching<br>
To reach you<br>
In the middle of the hardest<br>
Fight, It's true, I will rescue you<br>
<br>
I hear the whisper underneath your breath<br>
I hear you whisper,<br>
You have nothing left<br>
<br>
I will<br>
Send out an army to find you<br>
In the middle of the darkest<br>
Night, It's true, I will rescue you<br>
<br>
I will<br>
Never stop marching<br>
To reach you<br>
In the middle of the hardest<br>
Fight, It's true, I will rescue you<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, I will rescue you<br>

<br>
When I Read the Bible Through<br>
is a poem by Amos Russel Wells<br>
He was born in 1862, and he passed away in 1933.<br>
<br>
Amos Russel Wells was a United States editor, author and a professor of Greek and geology at Antioch College from 1883 to 1891.<br>
In 1891 he was also an editor of the Christian Endeavor World magazine and publishing company, in Boston.<br>
From 1901, he was associate author of Peloubet's Notes on the Sunday School Lessons.<br>
He was a member of the International Sunday-School Lesson Committee.<br>
<br>
His works include books dealing with young people's work, the Sunday school, juvenile fiction, poetry and devotional literature.<br>
<br>
<br>
He used the Christian Endeavor World, in Boston, to publish a book of his poems, in 1921.<br>
The book is titled, "The Collected Poems of Amos R. Wells".<br>
It has 257 pages, with illustrations by Hiram Putnam Barnes,<br>
and one on page 34 by Charles D. Hubbard.<br>
Page 249 to page 257, those last 9 pages, are an Index of all of the poem titles and topics.<br>
I want to share with you, a poem that he has on Page 8.<br>
<br>
The poem is titled, When I Read the Bible Through.<br>
<br>
It is a poem that repeats the message that I shared with you,<br>
way back when we were in Christian Essays 1,<br>
when I told that short story in the Christian Essay: Best Seller.<br>
The point was, when we randomly jump around in a book and just read a random verse or sample, here and there, that is not how you're supposed to read a book!<br>
You're supposed to start at the beginning and read each page completely all the way to the end! How can you get all that the book has to offer when you only read little bits and pieces, here and there, randomly like that?<br>
<br>
Well, I ask you, what's wrong with me reading a book like that?  I mean, after all, isn't that how we all read our Bibles?<br>
<br>
Some people have been sharing a poorly paraphrased version of this poem on the Internet,<br>
and then they say that the author is unknown, which is not true.<br>
<br>
The book is in Public Domain and has no copyright anymore.<br>
The entire book can be viewed and read online, for free at<br>
the HathiTrust Digital Library.<br>
HathiTrust is a partnership of academic and research institutions, offering a collection of over 17 million titles of digitised items from libraries around the world.<br>
Here is the website address as it was found in February 2022.&nbsp; Babel Collections at the HathiTrust Digital Library: The Collected Poems of Amos R. Wells.<br>
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t6xw52k04">https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t6xw52k04</a><br>
<br>
In this poem is the English word, coruscant.<br>
Most dictionaries do not even have this word listed at all.<br>
It was eventually found in the Collins Dictionary.<br>
In February 2022, I went to the Collins Dictionary to look up the word, coruscant.<br>
And, according to the Collins Dictionary, coruscant, means,<br>
giving off flashes of light.<br>
So, when you read the part in the poem that says, Imperial Jeremiah, With his keen, coruscant mind;<br>
I think the author is trying to say that Jeremiah has a mind that thinks as fast as a flash of lightning.<br>
But the Bible does not really say that.<br>
This has nothing to do with Coruscant, the planet that has the same name in the fictional Star Wars universe.<br>
<br>
Here is the poem, titled,<br>
When I Read the Bible Through<br>

I supposed I knew my Bible<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Reading piecemeal, hit and miss,<br>
Now a bit of John or Matthew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now a snatch of Genesis,<br>
Certain chapters of Isaiah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Certain Psalms (the twenty-third!);<br>
Twelfth of Romans, First of Proverbs --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yes, I thought I knew the Word!<br>
But I found that thorough reading<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Was a different thing to do,<br>
And the way was unfamiliar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When I read the Bible through.<br>
<br>
Oh, the massive, mighty volume!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Oh, the treasures manifold!<br>
Oh, the beauty of the wisdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And the grace it proved to hold!<br>
As the story of the Hebrews<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Swept in majesty along,<br>
As it leaped in waves prophetic,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As it burst to sacred song,<br>
As it gleamed with Christly omens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Old Testament was new,<br>
Strong with cumulative power,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When I read the Bible through.<br>
<br>
Ah! Imperial Jeremiah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  With his keen, coruscant mind;<br>
And the blunt old Nehemiah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And Ezekiel refined!<br>
Newly came the Minor Prophets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each with his distinctive robe,<br>
Newly came the Song idyllic,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And the tragedy of Job;<br>
Deuteronomy, the regal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To a towering mountain grew,<br>
With its comrade peaks around it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When I read the Bible through.<br>
<br>
What a radiant procession<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As the pages rise and fall,<br>
James the sturdy, John the tender<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  O the myriad-minded Paul!<br>
Vast apocalyptic glories<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wheel and thunder, flash and flame,<br>
Whilst the church triumphant raises<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  One incomparable Name.<br>
Ah, the story of the Saviour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Never glows supremely true<br>
Till you read it whole and swiftly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Till you read the Bible through.<br>
<br>
You who like to play at Bible,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dip and dabble, here and there,<br>
Just before you kneel, aweary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And yawn through a hurried prayer;<br>
You who treat the Crown of Writings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As you treat no other book --<br>
Just a paragraph disjointed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Just a crude, impatient look --<br>
Try a worthier procedure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Try a broad and steady view;<br>
You will kneel in very rapture<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When you read the Bible through!<br>
<br>

2 Peter 3: 14 & 15 (NLT)<br>
14 And so, dear friends, whilst you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.<br>
15 And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved....<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 15:7 (KJV)<br>
Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.<br>
<br>
<br>

But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:8<br>
KJV:<br>
(My heart said unto thee, Let my face seek thy face.) When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.<br>

<br>
Commentary: I'd like to share with you here next, the words to one of his songs, titled, My Reward.<br>
Yes, we are looking forward to the day that we see him, and get to be in Heaven with him.<br>
However, there an aspect about this song that I would like to comment about.<br>
It is possible to interpret the song as having a message that would be, we are just waiting around for the day when we go to Heaven.<br>
We're just waiting around, with nothing to do.  As though we were at a bus stop, waiting for the bus, or we're just standing around at a train station, waiting for the train to arrive,  or a chariot of fire to come down from the sky and swoop us up into the clouds.<br>
The Bible teaches us, until that day comes, we have a list of things to do.<br>
Here is a paraphrased, compiled list for you and for me...<br>
1. Read your Bible, all of it, study all of it, and try your best to do what it says, and obey it, every day.<br>
2. Pray for each other, what you see and what He reveals to you, pray for that.<br>
3. Love one another, and look for ways to help each other.<br>
4. Take the people that are in your life, and make their interests more important than your own.<br>
Spend some time with each of one them, and make what it is that they want to do more important than what you want to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the words to one of his songs, titled, My Reward.<br>
There is a Studio Version, and a Live Version.<br>
The Studio Version is extremely hard to find.<br>
It was found in 2006, but it may be as old as 2003.<br>
The only recording that seems to be easy to find on the Internet is the Live Version.<br>
Since we are quoting here from the original Studio Version, we will not be including any lyrics from the Live version.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the original Studio Version of the song, My Reward, by Paul Baloche.<br>
<br>
<br>
I want to hear You say, the words to me, "well done"<br>
I want to hear You say, "good and faithful servant"<br>
I want to hear You say, "I've prepared a place for you"<br>
Let all the treasures of this world<br>
Fade away<br>
<br>
Jesus, You are my reward<br>
To hear Your voice on that day<br>
Is all I'm living for<br>
Jesus, You are my reward<br>
To see Your face on that day<br>
Is all I'm living for<br>
<br>
I want to hear You say, words to me, "well done"<br>
I want to hear You say, "good and faithful servant"<br>
I want to hear You say, "I've prepared a place for you"<br>
Lord, let all the treasures of this world<br>
Fade away<br>
<br>
Jesus, You are my reward<br>
To hear Your voice on that day<br>
Is all I'm living for<br>
Jesus, You are my reward<br>
To see Your face on that day<br>
Is all I'm living for<br>
<br>
Jesus, all I'm living for<br>
<br>
Lord Jesus, You are my reward<br>
<br>
Jesus, all I'm living for<br>
<br>
