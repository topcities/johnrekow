Exodus 21: 10 & 11 KJV<br>
21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.<br> 		 
21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.<br>
<br>
Exodus 21: 10 & 11 NLT<br>
10 "If a man who has married a slave wife takes another wife for himself, he must not neglect the rights of the first wife to food, clothing, and sexual intimacy.<br>
11 If he fails in any of these three obligations, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 21:15-17 KJV<br>
21:15 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:<br>
21:16 Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:<br>
21:17 But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath (that is found with him): for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 21:15-17 NLT<br>
15 "Suppose a man has two wives, but he loves one and not the other, and both have given him sons. And suppose the firstborn son is the son of the wife he does not love.<br>
16 When the man divides his inheritance, he may not give the larger inheritance to his younger son, the son of the wife he loves, as if he were the firstborn son.<br>
17 He must recognise the rights of his oldest son, the son of the wife he does not love, by giving him a double portion. He is the first son of his father's virility, and the rights of the firstborn belong to him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 17:14-20 KJV<br>
17:14 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;<br>
17:15 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.<br>
17:16 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.<br>
17:17 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.<br>
17:18 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:<br>
17:19 And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:<br>
17:20 That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 17:14-20 NLT<br>
14 "You are about to enter the land the Lord your God is giving you. When you take it over and settle there, you may think, 'We should select a king to rule over us like the other nations around us.'<br>
15 If this happens, be sure to select as king the man the Lord your God chooses. You must appoint a fellow Israelite; he may not be a foreigner.<br>
16 "The king must not build up a large stable of horses for himself or send his people to Egypt to buy horses, for the Lord has told you, 'You must never return to Egypt.'<br>
17 The king must not take many wives for himself, because they will turn his heart away from the Lord. And he must not accumulate large amounts of wealth in silver and gold for himself.<br>
18 "When he sits on the throne as king, he must copy for himself this body of instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.<br>
19 He must always keep that copy with him and read it daily as long as he lives. That way he will learn to fear the Lord his God by obeying all the terms of these instructions and decrees.<br>
20 This regular reading will prevent him from becoming proud and acting as if he is above his fellow citizens. It will also prevent him from turning away from these commands in the smallest way. And it will ensure that he and his descendants will reign for many generations in Israel.<br>

1 Timothy 3: verse 2 and then verse 12 KJV<br>
3:2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, (modest,) of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;<br>
3:12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 3: verse 2 and then verse 12 -- NLT<br>
2 So a church leader must be a man whose life is above reproach. He must be faithful to his wife.<br>
(He must have only one wife, he must be married only once, he must be the husband of one wife.)<br>
He must exercise self-control, live wisely, and have a good reputation. He must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must be able to teach.<br>
12 A deacon must be faithful to his wife,<br>
(He must have only one wife, he must be married only once, he must be the husband of one wife.)<br>
and he must manage his children and household well.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2: verse 1 through 6 -- KJV<br>
2:1 I exhort (and I desire) therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;<br>
2:2 For kings, and for all that are in authority;<br>
(and for all that are in eminent place;)<br>
that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.<br>
2:3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;<br>
2:4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.<br>
2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;<br>
2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.<br>
(to be a testimony in due time.)<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2: verse 1 through 6 -- NLT<br>
1 I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them.<br>
2 Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity.<br>
3 This is good and pleases God our Saviour,<br>
4 who wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth.<br>
5 For, There is one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity -- the man Christ Jesus.<br>
6 He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time.<br>

<br>
Sober<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's begin by taking another closer look at 1 Timothy 3.<br>
Margin notes are included, inside the round brackets.<br>
We will be reading the margin notes as we go along, reading the Bible verses.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 3: 1-13 KJV<br>
3:1 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.<br>
3:2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, (modest,) of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;<br>
3:3 Not given to wine, (not ready to quarrel and offer wrong as one in wine,) no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;<br>
3:4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;<br>
3:5 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)<br>
3:6 (Not one newly come to the faith,) Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.<br>
3:7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.<br>
3:8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;<br>
3:9 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.<br>
3:10 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.<br>
3:11 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.<br>
3:12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.<br>
3:13 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 3: 1-13 NLT<br>
(If someone aspires to be a church leader, an overseer, or a bishop, he desires an honourable position.)<br>
1 This is a trustworthy saying: "If someone aspires to be a church leader, he desires an honourable position."<br>
<br>
2 So a church leader must be a man whose life is above reproach. He must be faithful to his wife. He must exercise self-control, live wisely, and have a good reputation. He must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must be able to teach.<br>
(He must have only one wife, he must be married only once, he must be the husband of one wife.)<br>
3 He must not be a heavy drinker or be violent.<br>
(He must not drink too much wine.)<br>
He must be gentle, not quarrelsome, and not love money.<br>
<br>
4 He must manage his own family well, having children who respect and obey him.<br>
<br>
5 For if a man cannot manage his own household, how can he take care of God's church?<br>
<br>
6 A church leader must not be a new believer, because he might become proud, and the devil would cause him to fall.<br>
(A church leader must not be a new believer, because he might become proud, and he might fall into the same judgement as the devil.)<br>
<br>
7 Also, people outside the church must speak well of him so that he will not be disgraced and fall into the devil's trap.<br>
8 In the same way, deacons must be well respected and have integrity. They must not be heavy drinkers or dishonest with money.<br>
(He must not drink too much wine.)<br>
9 They must be committed to the mystery of the faith now revealed and must live with a clear conscience.<br>
<br>
10 Before they are appointed as deacons, let them be closely examined. If they pass the test, then let them serve as deacons.<br>
<br>
11 In the same way, their wives must be respected and must not slander others.<br>
(In the same way, the women must be respected and must not slander others.)<br>
(In the same way, the women deacons must be respected and must not slander others.)<br>
They (the wives, women, women deacons) must exercise self-control and be faithful in everything they do.<br>
<br>
12 A deacon must be faithful to his wife, and he must manage his children and household well.<br>
(He must have only one wife, he must be married only once, he must be the husband of one wife.)<br>
<br>
13 Those who do well as deacons will be rewarded with respect from others and will have increased confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Although there are several verses that promote responsible drinking of alcohol, there are many verses that are in opposition to alcohol consumption.<br>
Here are the verses that discourage the drinking of alcohol, or of drinking too much alcohol to the point where one would become drunk.<br>
Some of these Bible verses being quoted here, verses that are prohibiting alcohol, or restricting alcohol consumption, are being taken out of context, and were only to be applied to particular individuals in a certain situation, that had a particular role in leadership, or they were given a specific title, or they had to stay away from alcohol because they had taken a vow or promise, or they were a certain kind of a person with a particular title, where, during their service or ministry, whilst on duty, they should not drink any alcohol.<br>
<br>
Romans 14:21-23 KJV<br>
14:21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.<br>
14:22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.<br>
14:23 (And he that discerneth, and putteth a difference between meats is damned if he eat,) And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.<br>
<br>
Romans 14:21-23 NLT<br>
21 It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble.<br>
(It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble or be offended or be weakened.)<br>
22 You may believe there's nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it between yourself and God. Blessed are those who don't feel guilty for doing something they have decided is right.<br>
23 But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are sinning if you go ahead and do it. For you are not following your convictions. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.<br>
<br>
Romans 16:25-27 NLT<br>
25 Now all glory to God, who is able to make you strong, just as my Good News says. This message about Jesus Christ has revealed his plan for you Gentiles, a plan kept secret from the beginning of time.<br>
26 But now as the prophets foretold (as the prophetic writings foretold) and as the eternal God has commanded, this message is made known to all Gentiles everywhere, so that they too might believe and obey him.<br>
27 All glory to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, forever. Amen.<br>
<br>
Romans 16:24-27 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
24 The favour of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah be with you all. Ah-Main<br>
25 And to Him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah, according to the revelation of the secret which was kept silent since times of old,<br>
26 but now has been made manifest, and by the prophetic Scriptures has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the everlasting ELL-Low-Heem, for belief-obedience.<br>
27 To ELL-Low-Heem, wise alone, be the esteem, through Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah forever. Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
Commentary: You say that you believe. But, do you have belief-obedience? You trust, but do you trust and obey? You believe, but do you believe and obey him?<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, save us and help us have belief-obedience, Amen, Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 5:9 (KJV)<br>
and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;<br>
<br>
Hebrews 5:9 (NLT)<br>
In this way, God qualified him as a perfect High Priest, and he became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him.<br>
<br>

31:5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgement of any of the afflicted.<br>
(and pervert the judgement of all of the sons of affliction.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 31:4-5 NLT<br>
4<br>
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, to guzzle wine.<br>
Rulers should not crave alcohol.<br>
5<br>
For if they drink, they may forget the law<br>
and not give justice to the oppressed.<br>
<br>
<br>

21:17 (He that loveth sport shall be a poor man:) He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 21:17 NLT<br>
17<br>
Those who love pleasure become poor;<br>
those who love wine and luxury will never be rich.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 20:1 KJV<br>
20:1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 20:1 NLT<br>
1<br>
Wine produces mockers; alcohol leads to brawls.<br>
Those led astray by drink cannot be wise.<br>

<br>
Proverbs 23: verses 19-21, and verses 29-35 KJV<br>
23:19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.<br>
23:20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh (among riotous eaters of their flesh):<br>
23:21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.<br>
<br>
...still in chapter 23, skipping down to verse 29, reading to verse 35...<br>
<br>
23:29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?<br>
23:30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.<br>
23:31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.<br>
23:32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, (and stingeth like a cockatrice).<br>
23:33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.<br>
23:34 Yea, thou shalt be (as he that lieth down in the heart of the sea,) as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.<br>
23:35 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, (and I knew it not,) and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 23: verses 19-21, and verses 29-35 -- NLT<br>
19<br>
My child, listen and be wise:<br>
Keep your heart on the right course.<br>
20<br>
Do not carouse with drunkards<br>
or feast with gluttons,<br>
21<br>
for they are on their way to poverty,<br>
and too much sleep clothes them in rags.<br>
<br>
29<br>
Who has anguish? Who has sorrow?<br>
Who is always fighting? Who is always complaining?<br>
Who has unnecessary bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?<br>
30<br>
It is the one who spends long hours in the taverns,<br>
trying out new drinks.<br>
31<br>
Don't gaze at the wine, seeing how red it is,<br>
how it sparkles in the cup, how smoothly it goes down.<br>
32<br>
For in the end it bites like a poisonous snake;<br>
it stings like a viper.<br>
33<br>
You will see hallucinations,<br>
and you will say crazy things.<br>
34<br>
You will stagger like a sailor tossed at sea,<br>
clinging to a swaying mast.<br>
35<br>
And you will say, "They hit me, but I didn't feel it.<br>
I didn't even know it when they beat me up.<br>
When will I wake up<br>
so I can look for another drink?"<br>
<br>

Isaiah 5:11 KJV<br>
5:11 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them (till wine pursue them)!<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 5: 11 & 12 NLT<br>
11<br>
What sorrow for those who get up early in the morning<br>
looking for a drink of alcohol<br>
and spend long evenings drinking wine<br>
to make themselves flaming drunk.<br>
12<br>
They furnish wine and lovely music at their grand parties --<br>
lyre and harp, tambourine and flute --<br>
but they never think about the Lord<br>
or notice what he is doing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 5: 20-22 KJV<br>
(Woe unto them that say concerning evil, It is good)<br>
(Woe unto them that say concerning good, It is evil)<br>
5:20 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!<br>
(Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent before their face!)<br>
5:21 Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!<br>
5:22 Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:<br>
<br>
Isaiah 5: 20-24 NLT<br>
20<br>
What sorrow for those who say<br>
that evil is good and good is evil,<br>
that dark is light and light is dark,<br>
that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.<br>
21<br>
What sorrow for those who are wise in their own eyes<br>
and think themselves so clever.<br>
22<br>
What sorrow for those who are heroes at drinking wine<br>
and boast about all the alcohol they can hold.<br>
23<br>
They take bribes to let the wicked go free,<br>
and they punish the innocent.<br>
24<br>
Therefore, just as fire licks up stubble<br>
and dry grass shrivels in the flame,<br>
so their roots will rot<br>
and their flowers wither.<br>
For they have rejected the law of the Lord of Heaven's Armies;<br>
they have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 4:11 KJV<br>
4:11 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 4:11 NLT<br>
they have deserted the Lord<br>
11<br>
to worship other gods.<br>
"Wine has robbed my people<br>
of their understanding.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28: 5-9 KJV<br>
28:5 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,<br>
28:6 And for a spirit of judgement to him that sitteth in judgement, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.<br>
28:7 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgement.<br>
28:8 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.<br>
28:9 Whom shall he teach knowledge? (and whom shall he make to understand the hearing?) and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28: 5-9 NLT<br>
5<br>
Then at last the Lord of Heaven's Armies<br>
will himself be Israel's glorious crown.<br>
He will be the pride and joy<br>
of the remnant of his people.<br>
6<br>
He will give a longing for justice<br>
to their judges.<br>
He will give great courage<br>
to their warriors who stand at the gates.<br>
7<br>
Now, however, Israel is led by drunks<br>
who reel with wine and stagger with alcohol.<br>
The priests and prophets stagger with alcohol<br>
and lose themselves in wine.<br>
They reel when they see visions<br>
and stagger as they render decisions.<br>
8<br>
Their tables are covered with vomit;<br>
filth is everywhere.<br>
9<br>
"Who does the Lord think we are?" they ask.<br>
"Why does he speak to us like this?<br>
Are we little children,<br>
just recently weaned?<br>

Habakkuk 2:15 KJV<br>
2:15 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!<br>
<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 2: 15 & 16 NLT<br>
15<br>
"What sorrow awaits you who make your neighbours drunk!<br>
You force your cup on them<br>
so you can gloat over their shameful nakedness.<br>
16<br>
But soon it will be your turn to be disgraced.<br>
(Come, drink and stagger!)<br>
Come, drink and be exposed!<br>

<br>
Judges 13:4 KJV<br>
13:4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:<br>
<br>
Judges 13:4 NLT<br>
4 So be careful; you must not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink nor eat any forbidden food.<br>
(you must not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink nor eat any unclean thing.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 1: 15 & 16 KJV<br>
1:15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.<br>
1:16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.<br>
<br>
Luke 1: 15 & 16 NLT<br>
15 for he will be great in the eyes of the Lord. He must never touch wine or other alcoholic drinks. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth.<br>
(He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from birth.)<br>
16 And he will turn many Israelites to the Lord their God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: 6-8 KJV<br>
5:6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:<br>
5:7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.<br>
5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: 6-11 NLT<br>
6 So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honour.<br>
7 Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.<br>
8 Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.<br>
9 Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith.<br>
(Remember that your brotherhood all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.)<br>
Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.<br>
10 In his kindness God called you to share in his eternal glory by means of Christ Jesus. So after you have suffered a little while, he will restore, support, and strengthen you, and he will place you on a firm foundation.<br>
11 All power to him forever! Amen.<br>

Targum Examples<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When we did the Bible Study titled, Seven Feast Dates and Calculations,<br>
we looked at some verses that were published in the Targums.<br>
<br>
We mentioned in that Bible study that, you can generally think of the Targums as a memorised, but paraphrased, recollection of the Hebrew Torah,<br>
translated from Hebrew, to another language, and then translated again into English.<br>
Because it is a paraphrased recollection of Torah, being recalled from one's memory as they create the translation, it has expanded descriptions, expanded explanations, and some commentaries,<br>
all included in the recalled-from-memory, paraphrased translation.<br>
<br>
It can be thought of as a look at some Old Testament Bible verses,<br>
that include some thoughts, associated teachings and commentaries,<br>
that were popular, common and traditionally talked about many centuries ago.<br>
<br>
Let's look at a few more examples of some areas of Old Testament scripture<br>
and see how it is worded in the Targums.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Targum quotes will all be coming from the following source,<br>

On the Pentateuch With The Fragments of the Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee<br>
by J. W. Etheridge, M.A.<br>
First Published in the year 1862<br>
<br>
1862 targumic texts in English translation<br>
Numbers, chapter 6, verses 22 through 27,<br>
Unofficially nicknamed, The Priestly Blessing.<br>
Mosheh is the correct Hebrew way to pronounce the English name, Moses.<br>
(the Lord spoke with Moses,)<br>
And the Lord spake with Mosheh, saying: Speak with Aharon and his sons, saying:<br>
Thus shall you bless the children of Israel, whilst spreading forth the hands from the high place (of speaking);<br>
in this tongue.<br>
The Lord bless thee and keep thee.<br>
The Lord make His face to shine upon thee, and gracious unto thee.<br>
The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and grant thee peace.<br>
The Lord bless thee in all thy business, and keep thee from demons of the night,<br>
and things that cause terror, and from demons of the noon and of the morning,<br>
and from malignant spirits arid phantoms. The Lord make His face to shine upon thee,<br>
when occupied in the law, and reveal to thee its secrets, and be merciful unto thee.<br>
The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee in thy prayer, and grant thee peace in thy end.<br>
And they shall bestow the benediction of My Name upon the children of Israel, and I, by My Word,<br>
will bless them.<br>

Genesis 1:3<br>
And the Lord said, Let there be light and to enlighten above; and at once there was light. And the Lord beheld the light, that it was good; and the Lord divided between the light and the darkness. And the Lord call the light Day; and He made it that the inhabiters of the world might labour by it: and the darkness called He night; and He made it that in it the creatures might have rest. And it was evening, and it was morning, the First Day.<br>
(And it was evening, and it was morning, in the order of the work of the creation, (or of the beginning,) the First Day.)<br>

Genesis 1:27-30<br>
And the Lord said to the angels who ministered before Him, who had been created in the second day of the creation of the world, Let us make man in Our image, in Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl which are in the atmosphere of heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every reptile creeping upon the earth. And the Lord created man in His Likeness: (And the Word of the Lord created man in His likeness, in the likeness of the presence of the Lord He created him, the male and his yoke-fellow He created them.) In the image of the Lord He created him, with two hundred and forty and eight members, with three hundred and sixty and five nerves, and overlaid them with skin, and filled it with flesh and blood.<br>
Male and female in their bodies He created them. And He blessed them, and the Lord said to them, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth with sons and daughters, and prevail over it, in its possessions; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heavens, and over every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth. And the Lord said, Behold, I have given you every herb whose seed seedeth upon the face of all the earth, and every unfruitful tree for the need of building and for burning; and the tree in which is fruit seeding after its kind, to you it shall be for food. But to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to every reptile upon the earth in which is the living soul, (I have given) all green herbs. And it was so. And the Lord beheld every thing He had made, and it was very good. And it was evening, and it was morning, the Sixth Day.<br>

The Ten Commandments<br>
1862 targumic texts in English translation<br>
Exodus chapter 19, last verse at the end of chapter 19<br>
verse 25<br>
So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.<br>
continuing into Exodus chapter 20, verse 1 reading down to chapter 20, verse 20...<br>
<br>
And Mosheh went down from the mountain to the people, and said to them, Draw nigh and hear the Law with Ten Words. (And Mosheh went down from the mountain to the people, and said to them, Draw nigh and receive the Ten Words.)<br>
<br>
And the Lord spake all these words, saying: (And the Word of the Lord (spake all the praise) spake all the excellency of these words saying:)<br>
<br>
The first word, as it came forth from the mouth of the Holy One, whose Name be blessed, was like storms, and lightnings, and flames of fire, with a burning light on His right hand and on His left. It winged its way through the air of the heavens, and was made manifest unto the camp of Israel, and returned, and was engraven on the tables of the covenant that were given by the hand of Mosheh, and were turned in them from side to side: and then called He, and said:<br>
<br>
Sons of Israel My people, I am the Lord your God, who brought you out free from the land of Mizraim, from the house of the bondage of slaves.<br>
The second word which came forth from the mouth of the Holy One, whose name be blessed, was like storms, and lightnings, and flames of fire.<br>
A burning light was on His right hand and on His left and was borne through the air of the heavens, returned, and was made manifest unto the camp of Israel; it returned, and was engraven on the tables of the covenant, and was turned in them from side to side. Then called He, and said, House of Israel, My people, Thou shalt have no other God beside Me. You shall not make to yourselves image or figure, or any similitude of what is in the heavens above, or on the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. You shall not bow down to them, or worship before them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God and an avenger, punishing with vengeance, recording the guilt of wicked fathers upon rebellious children unto the third and unto the fourth generation of them who hate Me; but keeping mercy and goodness for thousands of generations of the righteous who love Me, and who keep My commandments and My laws.<br>
<br>
My people of the house of Israel, Let no one of you swear by the name of the Word of the Lord your God in vain; for in the day of the great judgement the Lord will not hold guiltless any one who sweareth by His name in vain.<br>
<br>
My people of the house of Israel, Remember the day of Shabbatha, to sanctify it. Six days you shall labour, and do all your service: but the seventh day is (for) rest and quietude before the Lord your God: you shall not perform any work, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your servants, and your handmaids, and your sojourners who are in your cities. For in six days the Lord created the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and whatever is therein, and rested on the seventh day: therefore the Lord hath blessed the day of Shabbatha and sanctified it.<br>
<br>
My people, the house of Israel, Let every man be instructed in the honour of his father and in the honour of his mother: that your days may be multiplied upon the land which the Lord your God giveth you.<br>
<br>
My people, the sons of Israel, You. shall not be murderers; you shall not be companions of or partakers with murderers: in the congregations of Israel there shall not be seen a murderous people; neither shall your sons rise up after you and teach one another to take part with murderers: for on account of the guilt of murder the sword cometh forth upon the world.<br>
<br>
My people of the house of Israel, Be ye not adulterers, nor companions nor partakers with adulterers: nor in the congregations of Israel shall there be seen an adulterous people, that your sons may not arise after you to teach one another to have part with adulterers: for through the guilt of adultery death cometh forth upon the world.<br>
<br>
Sons of Israel My people, Ye shall not be thieves, nor companions nor partakers with thieves: there shall not be seen in the congregations of Israel a thievish people; that your sons may not arise after you to teach one another to have part with thieves: for on account of the guilt of theft famine cometh forth upon the world.<br>
<br>
Sons of Israel My people, Ye shall not testify against your neighbours a testimony of falsehood, nor be companions or partakers with those who bear false witness nor shall there be seen in the congregations of Israel a people who testify a testimony of falsehood; neither shall your sons arise after you to teach one another to have part with those who testify falsehood: for because of the guilt of false testimony the clouds go up and the rain cometh not down, and dryness cometh upon the world.<br>
<br>
Sons of Israel My people, Ye shall not be covetous companions or partakers with the covetous: nor shall there be seen in the congregations of Israel a covetous people; that your sons may not arise after you to teach one another to have part with the covetous: neither shall any among you covet the wife of his neighbour, nor his servant, nor his handmaid, nor his ox, nor his ass nor anything that belongeth to his neighbour; because through the guilt of covetousness the government breaketh in upon the possessions of men to take them, and the wealthy are made poor, and slavery cometh upon the world.<br>
<br>
And all the people saw the thunders, and were turned back, every one as he heard them coming forth from the midst of the lights, and the voice of the trumpet as it will raise the dead, and the mountain smoking; and all the people saw and drew back, and stood twelve miles off. And they said to Mosheh, Speak thou with us, and we can hear; but let it not be spoken with us any more from before the Lord, lest we die.<br>
(And all the people saw the thunders and the lights, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and the people saw and trembled, and stood afar off.)<br>
<br>
And Mosheh said to the people, Fear not; for the glory of the Lord is revealed to try you, whether His fear is before your faces, that ye may not sin. And the people stood twelve miles off; but Mosheh drew near to the height of the darkness where was the glory of the Lord.<br>

Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan Ben Uzziel<br>
Genesis 15: 1 through 7<br>
After these words, when the kings had gathered together, and had fallen before Abram; and four kings had been slain, and nine hosts brought back, Abram reasoned in his heart, and said, Woe to me, because I have received the reward of my appointments in this world, and have no portion in the world to come. Or peradventure the brethren and friends of those who have been slain will combine in legions and come against me; or that at that time there was found with me the reward of a little righteousness, so that they fell before me; but the second time reward may not be found with me, and by me the name of the Heavens may be profaned.<br>
Thereupon was the word (pithgama) of the Lord with Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not; for if these men should gather together in legions and come against thee, My Word (Memra) will be thy shield: and also if these fall before thee in this world, the reward of thy good works shall be kept, and be prepared before Me in the world to come, great exceedingly.<br>
<br>
And Abram said, Lord God, great blessings hast Thou given me, and great (are they which it is) before Thee to give me: nevertheless, what profit is to me, when I pass from the world without children, and Eliezer the manager (bar pharnasath, the son of sustenance) of my house, by whose hands signs were wrought for (or to) me in Darmasek, expects to be my heir?<br>
And Abram said, Behold, to me Thou hast not given a son; and, behold, the manager of my house will be my heir. And, behold, a word from before the Lord was to him, saying, He shall not be thine heir; but a son whom thou wilt beget shall be thy heir. And He brought him forth without, and said, Look up now to the heavens, and number the stars, if thou art able to number them: and he said, So will be thy sons. And he believed in the Lord, and had faith in the (Memra) Word of the Lord, and He reckoned it to him for righteousness (lizeku), because he parleyed not before him with words. And He said to him, I am the Lord who brought thee out of the fiery furnace of the Kasdai, to give thee this land to inherit.<br>

Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee<br>
Genesis 15: 1 through 7<br>
The Lord's Covenant Promise to Abram<br>
After these words, when all the kings of the lands, and the sultans of the provinces, had gathered together, and had made war against Abram the Just, and had fallen before him, and he had slain of them four kings, and had brought back nine hosts, did Abram the Just reason in his heart, and say, Woe, now, to me, because I have received the reward ordained in the present world, and have no portion in the world to come.<br>
Or peradventure the brethren and kindred of the slain who have fallen before me, who are in their cities and provinces, will combine in great legions, and come against me; or peradventure there were in my hand a few commandments in the former times, so that they fell before me when they had risen up against me; or it may be that righteousness was found in me at the former times, that they fell before me, but at the second time it may not be found, and the Heavenly Name will be profaned in me. Then was the word of prophecy from the Lord unto Abram the Righteous, saying, Fear not, Abram, though they should gather together and come against thee with many legions, My Word shall be thy reward and thy shield in this world, and a protector over thee all the days of the world to come. And though I deliver up thy adversaries before thee in this world, the reward of thy good works is prepared for thee also before Me in the world to come.<br>
<br>
And Abram said, Before Thee I supplicate mercy, O Lord God. Manifold blessings Thou hast given me, and many hast Thou before Thee still to give: nevertheless, what profit have I who go from the world childless, and Eliezer, the son of my house, by whose hands signs were wrought for me in Damasek, expecteth in himself to be my heir?<br>
And He said to him, I am the Lord who brought thee out of the fiery furnace from Ur of the Kasdai.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Jerusalem Targum From the Chaldee survives only in Fragments.<br>
It sounds like some parts of verses 5 and 6 are not in here like they should be.<br>
That really was verse 7, where we stopped.<br>
In verse 7, the KJV says, Ur of the Chaldees, where we read that part that said, Ur of the Kasdai.<br>
The person who made this translation for the Chaldee is mixing some parts from The Book of Jasher into his recollection of Genesis 15.<br>
The story about Abram and Haran his brother being in a furnace is an amazing story that you can still find and read today in a book that is no longer in the Bible.<br>
As for Haran, his brother, his heart was not perfect with the Lord, and he did not survive the furnace.<br>
The Book of Jasher, Chapter 12, mainly verses 22 through 32 has this story with a miracle similar to the one found in Daniel 3, which is the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, except Abram walked in the midst of the fire three days and three nights before exiting the furnace.<br>
The story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego was studied in Christian Essays 4.<br>
By the way, there is also a Targum of Onkelos, but his translation, overall, is so close to the KJV that you might as well just stay in the KJV and call it good.<br>

Genesis 17: 1-7<br>
Abram Is Named Abraham<br>
And Abram was the son of ninety and nine years, and the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am El Shadai; serve before Me and be perfect (shelim) in thy flesh.<br>
And I will set My covenant between My Word and thee, and will multiply thee very greatly. And because Abram was not circumcised, he was not able to stand, but he bowed himself upon his face; and the Lord spake with him, saying, Behold, I have confirmed (or divided) my covenant with thee; and thou shalt be the father of many peoples. And thy name shall be no more called Abram, but Abraham shall be thy name, because to be the father of a great multitude of peoples have I appointed thee. And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and will set thee for congregations; and kings ruling over peoples shall come forth from thee. And I have established My covenant between My Word and thee, and thy sons after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee and to thy sons after thee. And I will give to thee and to thy sons after thee the land of thy habitation, all the land of Kenaan, for an everlasting possession: and I will be to them Eloha.<br>

Targum of Isaiah 58<br>
Targum Ben Uzziel on Isaiah<br>
This chapter talks about True and False Worship.<br>
1 Cry aloud, O prophet, spare not, lift up thy voice like the voice of a trumpet, and shew unto my people their rebellion, and unto the house of Jacob their sins.<br>
2 And they seek daily instruction from me, as if to know the ways which are right before me, finding delight in my presence as a people that doeth righteousness, and have not forsaken the judgement of their God: they ask of me judgement and truth, as if they delighted to draw nigh to the fear of the Lord.<br>
3 They say, Wherefore do we fast, as it is revealed before Thee? wherefore have we afflicted ourselves, as known unto Thee? The prophet said unto them, Behold, in the day of your fast ye seek your extortions, and ye bring near all your stumbling-blocks.<br>
4 Behold, ye fast for provocation and strife, and to smite with the fist of wickedness; ye shall not fast a fast as if to make your voice to be heard on high.<br>
5 Is this the fast which I delight in? a day to afflict oneself? Is it to have his head bent down as a bulrush, and passing the night in sackcloth and ashes? Will ye call this a fast before the presence of the Lord, and a day in which I delight?<br>
6 Is not this the fast which I have chosen? to scatter the assembly of wickedness, to loose the fetters of a decree of perverted judgement, to set at liberty the sons of the freeborn, who have suffered violence, and to remove all perverted judgement?<br>
7 Shouldest not thou sustain the hungry with thy bread, and bring the poor that are cast out, into the midst of thy house? When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and shouldest not hide thine eyes from the kindred who is thy flesh?<br>
8 Then shall thy light be revealed like the early dawn, and the healing of thy wound shall appear quickly; thy great righteousness shall go before thee, and thou shalt be gathered to the glory, which is in the presence of the Lord.<br>
9 Then thou shalt pray, and the Lord shall hear thy prayer; thou shalt supplicate before Him and He shall grant thy supplication, if thou put away from the midst of thee perverted judgement, the pointing of the finger, and the speaking of violent words;<br>
10 And if thou breathest out thy soul before the hungry and satisfiest the afflicted soul, then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday:<br>
11 And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in the years of drought, and He shall quicken thy body with eternal life, and thy soul shall be full with delicacies like a watered garden, well irrigated, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.<br>
12 Thy offspring shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations, and they shall call thee, The restorer of the right way; The converter of the wicked to the law.<br>
13 If thou turn away thy foot' from the Sabbath from following thine employment on my holy day, and dost meet the Sabbath with great delight to sanctify the Lord, and honour Him, not doing thine own ways, nor making thy wants ample, nor speaking violent words:<br>
14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and He shall cause thee to dwell in the strong places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father; for thus it is decreed by the Word of the Lord.<br>

3. For he will deliver you, Solomon my son, from the snare and the obstacle, from death and confusion.<br>

15. He will pray in my presence and I will answer him; I am with him in distress, I will save him and (exalt and) glorify him.<br>
16. I will satisfy him with length of days; I will show him my redemption.<br>

Psalms 1<br>
1. Happy the man who has not walked in the council of the wicked, or stood in the paths of sinners, or taken a seat in the band of mockers.<br>
2. Instead his pleasure is in the law of the Lord, and in his Torah he meditates day and night.<br>
3. And he will be like a living tree planted by streams of water, whose fruit ripens in due course, and its leaves do not fall, and all its branches that grow ripen and flourish.<br>
4. Not so the wicked; instead, they are like the chaff that the storm-wind will drive.<br>
<br>
(Therefore the wicked will not stand in the great day of judgement nor sinners in the band of the righteous,)<br>
5. Therefore the wicked will not be acquitted in the great day, nor sinners in the band of the righteous,<br>
6. Because the path of the righteous is manifest in the Lord's presence, but the paths of the wicked will perish.<br>

Deuteronomy 24: 1-4 KJV<br>
<br>
24:1 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.<br>
24:2 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife.<br>
24:3 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;<br>
24:4 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 24: 1-4 NLT<br>
1 "Suppose a man marries a woman but she does not please him. Having discovered something wrong with her, he writes a document of divorce, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house.<br>
2 When she leaves his house, she is free to marry another man.<br>
3 But if the second husband also turns against her, writes a document of divorce, hands it to her, and sends her away, or if he dies,<br>
4 the first husband may not marry her again, for she has been defiled. That would be detestable to the Lord. You must not bring guilt upon the land the Lord your God is giving you as a special possession.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5: 31 & 32 KJV<br>
5:31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:<br>
5:32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5: 31 & 32 NLT<br>
31 "You have heard the law that says,<br>
'A man can divorce his wife by merely giving her a written notice of divorce.'<br>
(quoting from Deuteronomy 24:1)<br>
32 But I say that a man who divorces his wife, unless she has been unfaithful, causes her to commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman also commits adultery.<br>
<br>

<br>
Commentary: This area of scripture that we just now looked at, Matthew chapter 5, verses 31 and 32, may not sound like it is really in complete agreement with the actual Torah commandment found in Deuteronomy chapter 24, verses 1 through 4.<br>
<br>
Would Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give a teaching that is not quite in agreement with the Torah Old Testament commandments?<br>
<br>
<br>
It has been taught for centuries that, the Old Testament was generally made in Hebrew, and the New Testament was originally written in Greek.<br>
<br>
In the year 2021, an amazing discovery was found.<br>
In 2021, it was found out that the original Greek copies are actually translations from Hebrew!<br>
This means that the entire Bible was originally written in Hebrew.<br>
The New Testament was written in Hebrew, and then translated into Greek.<br>
<br>
There are a team of people that are carefully going over an Original Hebrew copy of the New testament,<br>
and they are carefully translating the ancient Hebrew New Testament into English.<br>
<br>
As of July of 2021, only some of the New Testament Hebrew books have been translated into English.<br>
If we ever get to see the book of Revelations get translated, I can't wait to see what happens in Hebrew when we look at the Mark of the Beast and the number 666 in the original, ancient Hebrew.<br>
<br>
Now that we know this spot here in Matthew 5 is actually a Greek verse translated into English, let's see what happens if we take the original Hebrew and translate that into English.<br>
<br>
This Hebrew to English translation has much better, clearer wording that is in more of a perfect alignment with the Old Testament commandment.<br>
The Greek-based KJV said, "whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery."<br>
The original Hebrew to English says, "every man who divorces his wife -- if not in the time of her adultery-- he performs adultery."<br>
<br>
The Hebrew-to-English New Testament translation is more accurate and in alignment with the Old Testament Law.<br>
Basically, if a man divorces his wife, and she did not commit adultery, then it is a sin of adultery to divorce her.<br>

Matthew 5: 31 & 32 -- Hebrew to English Translation, version 2.2<br>
(disciples are Talmidim)<br>
31 Moreover Yeshua Mashiach said to his talmidim,<br>
"The Torah says, 'He who divorces his wife, must give her a letter of divorcement.'<br>
32 And I say to you that every man who divorces his wife -- if not in the time of her adultery -- he performs adultery.<br>
<br>
Commentary from the Van Rensburgs Translation Team:<br>
The Torah says that a man who divorces his wife "deals treacherously with her."<br>
(Exodus 21:8: "he does not have the right to sell her (his wife) to a foreign nation when he deals treacherously with her.")<br>
And Malachi 2:15-16 says,<br>
"do not deal treacherously with the wife of your youth, for he who hates, divorces, says Yaw-Who-Wah"<br>
(Hating your wife is not loving your fellow as yourself!).<br>
<br>
Exodus 21:8 KJV<br>
21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, (If she be evil in the eyes of her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,) then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.<br>
<br>
Exodus 21:8 (NLT)<br>
If she does not satisfy her owner, he must allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.<br>
<br>
<br>
Malachi 2: 15 & 16 KJV<br>
(And did not he make one? Yet had he the excellency of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a seed of God. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal unfaithfully against the wife of his youth.)<br>
2:15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.<br>		 
(For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that if he hate her, put her away:)<br>
(For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth to put away:)<br>
2:16 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.<br>
<br>
Malachi 2: 13-16 NLT<br>
13 Here is another thing you do. You cover the Lord's altar with tears, weeping and groaning because he pays no attention to your offerings and doesn't accept them with pleasure.<br>
14 You cry out, "Why doesn't the Lord accept my worship?" I'll tell you why! Because the Lord witnessed the vows you and your wife made when you were young. But you have been unfaithful to her, though she remained your faithful partner, the wife of your marriage vows.<br>
<br>
(Didn't the Lord make us and preserve our life and breath?)<br>
(Didn't the one LORD make her, both flesh and spirit?)<br>
(The meaning of the Hebrew here in verse 15 is uncertain.)<br>
15 Didn't the Lord make you one with your wife? In body and spirit you are his. And what does he want? Godly children from your union. So guard your heart; remain loyal to the wife of your youth.<br>
(For he hates divorcing.)<br>
16 "For I hate divorce!" says the Lord, the God of Israel.<br>
"To divorce your wife is to overwhelm her with cruelty," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
(To divorce your wife is to cover one's garment with violence.)<br>
"So guard your heart; do not be unfaithful to your wife."<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
The Beatitudes were part of The Sermon on the Mount. It's a sermon that Jesus did.<br>
In the book of Matthew, there are nine Beatitudes.<br>
Matthew 5, verses 1 through 16, -- Hebrew to English Translation, version 2.2<br>
<br>
a disciple is Talmid.<br>
disciples are Talmidim.<br>
The Hebrew 'Talmid' is a student who learns from his teacher<br>
and follows his example. "Talmidim" is the masculine plural form.<br>

1 Yeshua Mashiach regarded the people<br>
(Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah beheld and closely looked at the people)<br>
who were coming up to the mountain. And when he had set himself down, his talmidim drew near unto him.<br>
(his disciples drew near unto him.)<br>
2<br>
He opened his mouth and taught them saying,<br>
3<br>
"Blessed are the humble ones of spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Yaw-Who-Wah<br>
(Blessed are the lowly ones of spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Yaw-Who-Wah)<br>
<br>
4 Blessed are the weeping ones, for unto them comfort will reach.<br>
(Blessed are those who weep, for unto them comfort will reach.)<br>
<br>
<br>
5 Blessed are the resting ones, for they will inherit the earth.<br>
("resting ones" are those who rest in obedience to Yaw-Who-Wah's ways.)<br>
6 Blessed are the ones hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they will be satisfied and will become satisfied ones.<br>
7 Blessed are the compassionate ones, for they will obtain compassion.<br>
8 Blessed are the pure ones of heart, for they will see Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
9 Blessed are the men of shalom, for they will be called the sons of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
(Blessed are the men of wholeness, completeness, well-being and peace, for they will be called the sons and daughters of Yaw-Who-Wah.)<br>
('Shalom' was also used as a greeting.)<br>
<br>
10 Blessed are those who bear the persecutions because of righteousness, for theirs will be the heavenly kingdom.<br>
11 Blessed ones you will be when the men curse you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil things against you, and lie -- because of me.<br>
12 Shout with joy -- your wages are great in the heavens, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.<br>
13 And it happened furthermore, that Yeshua Mashiach said unto (his disciples) his talmidim,<br>
"You are the instruction of the world, but the instruction is cut off by them who are not saved, and nothing else is fit, except to cast them to the street and to trample them.<br>
<br>
(You are the instruction of the world, but the instruction is split by them who are not saved,<br>
the instruction is destroyed by them who are not saved,<br>
the instruction is annihilated by them who are not saved,<br>
and nothing else is fit, except to cast them to the street and to trample them.)<br>
<br>
<br>
14 The light of the world is not able to hide the city that rests on the mountain.<br>
15 No man lights the lamp in order to set it under a covering, but to set it upon the menorah, in order to give light to all those who are in the house.<br>
(No man lights the lamp in order to set it under a covering, but to set it upon the lampstand, in order to give light to all those who are in the house.)<br>
<br>
16 So let your lamp shine before all, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in the heavens."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord's Prayer<br>
Matthew 6:1-15 -- Hebrew to English Translation, version 2.2<br>
1 Guard yourselves, that you do not make a crowd out of your good works before the people, in order to be good men in their eyes, for then you will lose the reward of your Father who is in the heavens."<br>
<br>
Commentary from the Van Rensburgs Translation Team:<br>
The Torah commands to give to the poor (Deuteronomy 15:7-10), and thus it is considered a deed of righteousness to do so.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Moreover Yeshua Mashiach said to his talmidim, "When you do a righteous deed,<br>
(When you do alms or give to the poor,)<br>
do not make the commotion -- like the false ones make in the houses of their congregations and in the ways, in order that the men should honour them. I say to you in truth that they have already received their reward.<br>
3 But when you do a righteous deed, your left hand must not know what your right hand does.<br>
4 On the contrary, let your righteous deed be concealed, that your heavenly Father may reward you."<br>
5 Moreover Yeshua Mashiach said to his talmidim, "When you pray, you must not do like the deed of the deceivers, who show themselves right, who love to pray in the houses of their assemblies and by the sides of the streets (or marketplaces), in order to be seen by the men. I say to you in truth that they have already received their reward.<br>
<br>
Commentary from the Van Rensburgs Translation Team:<br>
'El' is the short Hebrew word for 'God.'<br>
<br>
<br>
6 But you, when you pray, prepare it (prepare your prayer) in your inner room, and pray unto Yaw-Who-Wah in privacy, with a closed door. And the El (the God) who knows the hidden things will hear you.<br>
7 And when you pray, do not want to speak much, like the deficient ones, for they think that El (God) will hear them by the multitude of words.<br>
8 Therefore you must not want to be like them,<br>
(Therefore you must not consent to be like them,)<br>
for El knows what you need before you ask him.<br>
9 And this is the prayer you must say,<br>
<br>
'Our Father who is in heaven, let your name be sanctified, for it is Qadosh.<br>
(let your name be sanctified, for it is set-apart.)<br>
<br>
10 and let your kingdom come.<br>
(and let it come to your kingdom.)<br>
(and let him come to your kingdom.)<br>
<br>
Do your will in the heavens and on the earth.<br>
(Do your goodwill in the heavens and on the earth.)<br>
11 Give us bread every day, that it may support our lives.<br>
(Give us food every day, that it may sustain our lives.)<br>
<br>
Commentary from the Van Rensburgs Translation Team:<br>
In Hebrew, 'bread' also means food.<br>
And, once again, 'El' is the short Hebrew word for 'God.'<br>
<br>
<br>
12 And let go our guilts for us, for we let our guilty ones go.<br>
13 And do not lead us into testing, but keep us from all wickedness. Amein.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Some other later translations and manuscripts added right here, about 400 years later, the additional text,<br>
For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.<br>
However, the NLT detected that this was not in the original Greek copies and they removed it.<br>
It also is not mentioned here because this original Hebrew copy did not originally contain that extra text.<br>
Matthew did not originally write that additional text.<br>
In a later copy of a copy, about 400 or almost 500 years later, someone added that text, and it is that later copy of a copy of a copy that fell into the hands of those<br>
that made the King James Version, which is why you see it in the KJV, but you don't find it in the original Greek copies, and<br>
it's not here either, because it was not originally in the New Testament at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
14 If you forgive men their sins, El (God) will atone your errors for you.<br>
15 But if you do not forgive, El will not make atonement for you.<br>
<br>
(If you forgive men their sins, El will cover your errors for you. But if you do not forgive, El will not make covering for you.)<br>

23 Yeshua (Yaw-Who-Shaw) answered him,<br>
"If one loves me and keeps my words, my Father will love him -- and<br>
to him they will come, and with him they will work.<br>
24 Whosoever does not love me, will he establish my words? And the word which<br>
you heard is not mine, but is from my Father who sent me.<br>

Book of John, Commentary selections<br>
by the Van Rensburg family:<br>
"Although Yeshua (Yaw-Who-Shaw) did keep the Sabbath according to his<br>
Father's Torah, he did not keep the additional manmade Jewish laws regarding the<br>
Sabbath, and this is what they were so upset about.<br>
Yeshua (Yaw-Who-Shaw) did keep the Sabbath according to the Old Testament Law (Torah,) but the Pharisees had<br>
added many extra laws concerning the Sabbath; for example, that one was not allow so spit and<br>
make clay on the Sabbath, and Yeshua (Yaw-Who-Shaw) did not keep these man-made laws.<br>
<br>
In the Book of Matthew 4:4, did you know, where it says,<br>
4 Then he answered and said to him, "It is written, 'Man will not live by the<br>
bread alone, but by the grace of Yaw-Who-Wah.'<br>
Did you know that, the word, grace, right there,<br>
The Van Rensburg family says that, this Hebrew word for Grace,<br>
is a synonym for "Torah" which is, of course, also a synonym of "word."<br>
Yeshua (Yaw-Who-Shaw) confirmed the Torah by his life, actions and teachings.<br>
<br>
Matthew 5: 18 & 19<br>
18 I say unto you in truth, that not one word will be diminished from the Torah -- that it would not be performed until the end of the world.<br>
<br>
(not one word of the Torah will be diminished, every word will be performed -- until the end of the world.)<br>
<br>
19 And whosoever transgresses one of these smallest commandments, or teaches to break them, he will be small in the kingdom of heavens. On the contrary, whosoever teaches it and carries it out, great will he be in the kingdom of heavens.<br>
<br>
The Torah clearly says that "You must not hate your brother in your heart" (Leviticus 19:17).<br>
<br>
Leviticus 19:17 (KJV)<br>
Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.<br>
<br>

In June of 2021, my young daughter said to me, that this is the song that she wants to have performed at the start of her wedding ceremony.<br>
It was a song from 1976.  It is called, Love Note, from the band, Dogwood.<br>
I thought I would share with you the lyrics to this song, here, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
Lamb & Lion Records is a Christian record label founded in 1972 by the popular singer and actor Pat Boone and the former United Artists Records executive Irving Kessler.<br>
Based in California, the label featured Pat Boone, The Pat Boone Family, Debby Boone, DeGarmo & Key, Dan Peek and Gary Chapman.<br>
Lamb & Lion was Pat Boone's Record Label.<br>
<br>
Contemporary Christian stars Gary Chapman, Dogwood, Steve Green, and Degarmo & Key were among those who got their starts on the Lamb & Lion label.<br>
<br>
Dogwoods's first album was titled, After the Flood, Before the Fire,<br>
and it came out in 1975.<br>
<br>
Their second album, Love Note, came out in 1976. They had then released two more albums after that one.<br>
<br>
In June 2021, the website, AllMusic, Netaktion, remembered the band like this:<br>
<br>
This contemporary Christian duo was formed in Nashville, Tennessee by childhood friends Ron Elder and Steve Chapman.<br>
Growing up in West Virginia, they were both the sons of ministers and shared common interests in gospel and country music.<br>
After parting so that Elder could go to college and Chapman could join the American navy, they reunited in the early 1970s and began to play concerts around the country.<br>
As a return to the Christian values of their upbringing, they formed the band, Dogwood, in 1974 as what they termed 'a mobile, positive musical ministry'.<br>
A sequence of albums followed, beginning with After The Flood, Before The Fire. Successive releases helped introduce them to a wider Christian following, genre critics focusing on what Campus Life magazine described as the duo's 'crystal clear acoustics and vocals'.<br>
That reputation eventually led to noted artists such as the Imperials and Boones recording the duo's compositions on their own records during the 1970s.<br>
<br>
From their second album, Love Note, here are the words to the 1976 song, Love Note, from the Band, Dogwood...<br>
<br>
<br>
And I know by now you're wondering when I'll come<br>
But remember you're My Father's chosen one<br>
And in His own time He'll send Me to you<br>
But until I come, lean on the One I have sent you<br>
He will help you keep your heart from other loves<br>
And lead you safely to My side<br>
And all the time that's come and gone<br>
Has done no harm<br>
For I still am looking forward to the day<br>
When I hear My Father say<br>
This is your wedding day<br>
Go on
<br>
And all the time that's come and gone<br>
Has done no harm<br>
For I still am looking forward to the day<br>
When I hear My Father say<br>
This is your wedding day<br>
Go on<br>
My Love, hold on<br>
<br>
<br>

19:13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.<br>
19:14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.<br>
19:15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.<br>

13 He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title was the Word of God.<br>

15 From his mouth came a sharp sword to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He will release the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty, like juice flowing from a winepress.<br>

Revelation 20: all 15 verses of chapter 20 (KJV)<br>
20:1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.<br>
20:2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,<br>
20:3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.<br>
20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgement was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.<br>
20:5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.<br>
20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.<br>
20:7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,<br>
20:8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and MaGog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.<br>
20:9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.<br>
20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.<br>
20:11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.<br>
20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.<br>
20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.<br>
20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<br>
20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 20: all 15 verses of chapter 20 -- NLT<br>
1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven with the key to the bottomless pit and a heavy chain in his hand.<br>
2 He seized the dragon -- that old serpent, who is the devil, Satan -- and bound him in chains for a thousand years.<br>
3 The angel threw him into the bottomless pit, which he then shut and locked so Satan could not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were finished. Afterward he must be released for a little while.<br>
4 Then I saw thrones, and the people sitting on them had been given the authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony about Jesus and for proclaiming the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his statue, nor accepted his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They all came to life again, and they reigned with Christ for a thousand years.<br>
5 This is the first resurrection. (The rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years had ended.)<br>
6 Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. For them the second death holds no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him a thousand years.<br>
7 When the thousand years come to an end, Satan will be let out of his prison.<br>
8 He will go out to deceive the nations -- called Gog and Magog -- in every corner of the earth. He will gather them together for battle -- a mighty army, as numberless as sand along the seashore.<br>
9 And I saw them as they went up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded God's people and the beloved city. But fire from heaven came down on the attacking armies and consumed them.<br>
10 Then the devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the fiery lake of burning sulphur, joining the beast and the false prophet. There they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<br>
11 And I saw a great white throne and the one sitting on it. The earth and sky fled from his presence, but they found no place to hide.<br>
12 I saw the dead, both great and small, standing before God's throne. And the books were opened, including the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to what they had done, as recorded in the books.<br>
13 The sea gave up its dead, and death and the grave gave up their dead. And all were judged according to their deeds.<br>
14 Then death and the grave were thrown into the lake of fire. This lake of fire is the second death.<br>
15 And anyone whose name was not found recorded in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire.<br>

In May of 2021, my family re-discovered an old Christian Rock band called, Petra.<br>
One of our most favourite songs from Petra at that time was, All the King's Horses.<br>
Let's take a look at the words to that song, here, in just a moment.<br>
Before we do, let's take a look at the band, Petra, by learning a little bit about them, from what was said about Petra in Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, back in July of 2021.<br>
<br>
Petra is an American music group regarded as a pioneer of the Christian rock and contemporary Christian music genres and was, for many years, regarded as the "world's most popular Christian rock band".<br>
Formed in 1972, the band took its name from the Greek word for "rock". Though it disbanded formally in 2006, incarnations have played reunion shows in the years since and those different Petra band members released two albums in November 2010, and in November 2017.<br>
<br>
A form of the Petra band that exists today consists of 5 current Members.<br>
And, since the original band began in 1972, there have been at least 18 Past band members of Petra, at one time or another.<br>
A variation of the band still performs today.<br>
The original band members started Petra in 1972.<br>
The band's most successful and famous years were from 1986 to 1994.<br>
<br>
In more than three decades, the band experienced numerous lineup changes,<br>
yet released 20 studio albums, as well as two Spanish-language and two live albums,<br>
selling nearly 10 million copies whilst being nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, actually winning four Grammy Awards,<br>
and winning 10 Dove Awards.<br>
Petra's biggest hit became very popular in 1982. It was, "The Colouring Song", and it reached the top position on<br>
three Christian radio charts simultaneously, and at its peak,<br>
the band's tours rivalled Amy Grant's in popularity among Christian audiences.<br>
Petra was the first rock band inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame<br>
and the first Christian band whose memorabilia was included in the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant chain.<br>
<br>
From their tenth album, their ninth studio album, titled, This Means War! (released back in 1987,)<br>
Let's take a look at the words to Petra's 1987 song,  "All the King's Horses"<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 1987 song, All The King's Horses, from the band, Petra.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's an age-old score that's got to be settled<br>
It's an age-old debt that's got to be paid<br>
When the King breaks through in all of His glory<br>
To claim His throne on the world that He made<br>
<br>
The nations wait with their armies gathered<br>
With Jerusalem firmly under their thumbs<br>
There will be no peace in Armageddon Valley<br>
'Til the trumpet sounds and the cavalry comes<br>
<br>
When He arrives, He will conquer them all<br>
Take back the ground given after the fall<br>
<br>
All the King's horses and all the King's men<br>
Gonna ride down from heaven from where they've been<br>
All the King's horses and all the King's men<br>
Gonna put this world back together again<br>
Gonna put this world back together...<br>
<br>
On a great white horse, the King will come ridin'<br>
He's the One they call Faithful and True<br>
With His eyes of fire and blood-dripped clothing<br>
He had a name nobody else knew<br>
<br>
And by His side ride the armies of heaven<br>
Dressed in linens clean and white as the snow<br>
Riding down to earth with a vengeance so holy<br>
For the one-day battle that will crumple their foe<br>
<br>
And when the dust and the smoke disappears<br>
The King will reign for a thousand years<br>
<br>
All the King's horses and all the King's men<br>
Gonna ride down from heaven from where they've been<br>
All the King's horses and all the King's men<br>
Gonna put this world back together again<br>
Gonna put this world back together...<br>
<br>
All the King's horses and all the King's men<br>
Gonna put this world back together again<br>
Gonna put this world back together again<br>
<br>
When the lion lays down with the lamb<br>
There'll be peace in the Land of Abraham<br>
They will beat their swords into ploughs<br>
When every tongue declares, and every knee bows<br>
<br>
All the King's horses and all the King's men<br>
Gonna ride down from heaven from where they've been<br>
All the King's horses and all the King's men<br>
Gonna put this world back together again<br>
Gonna put this world back together again<br>
<br>
All the King's horses and all the King's men<br>
Gonna ride down from heaven from where they've been<br>
All the King's horses and all the King's men<br>
Gonna put this world back together again<br>
Gonna put this world back together again<br>

This instruction was originally intended just for Aaron and his sons, Aaron's descendants.<br>
Maybe it is something that we should all do?<br>
<br>
Leviticus 22:8 (KJV)<br>
22:8 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD.<br>
<br>
Leviticus 22:8 NLT<br>
(Tell Aaron and his sons, If any of Aaron's descendants do this, it would defile them...)<br>
8 He may not eat an animal that has died a natural death or has been torn apart by wild animals, for this would defile him. I am the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When you happen across a dead animal, found dead next to a road, did you know that, in the United States, there are some states that have made it legal and acceptable to take that dead animal, and take it home, butcher it, cook it and eat it?  We will just assume the animal was hit and killed by a vehicle driving down the road, or did it die due to some other reason?<br>
What happens when you disobey Torah, what happens when you disobey the commandments in the Bible?<br>
What happens when you disobey the commandments in the Old Testament?<br>
What happens when you disobey the commandments in the New Testament?<br>
What happens when I disobey, when you disobey, when we disobey the commandments in Leviticus 22, like the verse we just read about,<br>
eating animals found dead, which dieth of itself?<br>
What happens when I disobey, when you disobey, when we disobey the commandments in Deuteronomy 14,<br>
that tell us that we should never eat unclean animals,<br>
that we should never eat pigs and bats?<br>
<br>
The Ebola virus causes people to bleed both internally and externally, and has a death rate of 50% on average.<br>
Depending on which college textbook that you read, or which webpage that you read, it started in 1976 from one of three possible ways...<br>
1. it started from one person eating an animal (like, a monkey) that was found dead, which dieth of itself.<br>
2. it started from one person eating a bat<br>
3. it started from one person eating a pig<br>
<br>
In other words, the Ebola virus came from one person disobeying the Bible, disobeying the Torah commandments.<br>
Sin will not just hurt you; sin, your sin and the sins of others, will hurt the people around us,<br>
sin will hurt the people we love.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:26 KJV<br>
Be ye angry, and sin not....<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:11 KJV<br>
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin....<br>
<br>
John 8:11 (KJV)<br>
....go, and sin no more.<br>
<br>
John 5:14 (KJV)<br>
Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:17 (KJV)<br>
And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 8:12 (KJV)<br>
For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 8:12 (NLT)<br>
And I will forgive their wickedness, and I will never again remember their sins."<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:17 and Hebrews 8:12 are both quoting and referencing Jeremiah 31:31-34.<br>
We have looked at this area of Jeremiah 31 before, when we did a Bible study, titled, King and High Priest.<br>
We did that study when we were in Christian Essays 14, which is The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 14.<br>
So, we have read this before.  Let's read it again!<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 31:31-34 KJV<br>
31:31 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:<br>
31:32 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand (I was an husband unto them) to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake,<br>
(should I have continued a husband unto them?)<br>
although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:<br>
31:33 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br>
31:34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 31:31-40 NLT<br>
31 "The day is coming," says the Lord, "when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah.<br>
32 This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and brought them out of the land of Egypt. They broke that covenant, though I loved them as a husband loves his wife," says the Lord.<br>
33 "But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel after those days," says the Lord. "I will put my instructions deep within them, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.<br>
34 And they will not need to teach their neighbours, nor will they need to teach their relatives, saying, 'You should know the Lord.' For everyone, from the least to the greatest, will know me already," says the Lord. "And I will forgive their wickedness, and I will never again remember their sins."<br>
35<br>
It is the Lord who provides the sun to light the day<br>
and the moon and stars to light the night,<br>
and who stirs the sea into roaring waves.<br>
His name is the Lord of Heaven's Armies,<br>
and this is what he says:<br>
36<br>
"I am as likely to reject my people Israel<br>
as I am to abolish the laws of nature!"<br>
37<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Just as the heavens cannot be measured<br>
and the foundations of the earth cannot be explored,<br>
so I will not consider casting them away<br>
for the evil they have done.<br>
I, the Lord, have spoken!<br>
38 "The day is coming," says the Lord, "when all Jerusalem will be rebuilt for me, from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.<br>
39 A measuring line will be stretched out over the hill of Gareb and across to Goah.<br>
40 And the entire area -- including the graveyard and ash dump in the valley, and all the fields out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the Horse Gate -- will be holy to the Lord. The city will never again be captured or destroyed."<br>

What about eating fat?<br>
There are many verses about fat.<br>
Some sound like they are in support of it.<br>
Some talk about certain areas of fat in certain areas of the animal's body that are not to be eaten.<br>
Those fat parts get burned in the fire instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
To keep it short and simple, here are just a few verses to consider on eating fat...<br>
<br>
Leviticus 3:17 KJV<br>
3:17 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.<br>
<br>
Leviticus 3:17 NLT<br>
17 "You must never eat any fat or blood. This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation, wherever you live."<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 7:22-27 (KJV)<br>
7:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br> 		 
7:23 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.<br>
7:24 (And the fat of the carcase) And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.<br>
7:25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.<br>
7:26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.<br>
7:27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 7:22-27 NLT<br>
22 Then the Lord said to Moses,<br>
23 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. You must never eat fat, whether from cattle, sheep, or goats.<br>
24 The fat of an animal found dead or torn to pieces by wild animals must never be eaten, though it may be used for any other purpose.<br>
25 Anyone who eats fat from an animal presented as a special gift to the Lord will be cut off from the community.<br>
26 No matter where you live, you must never consume the blood of any bird or animal.<br>
27 Anyone who consumes blood will be cut off from the community."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 9:10 (KJV)<br>
9:10 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 9:10 NLT<br>
10 Then he burned on the altar the fat, the kidneys, and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 3: 3 & 4 (KJV)<br>
3:3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,<br>
(the suet that covereth the inwards, and all the suet that is upon the inwards,)<br>
3:4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks,<br>
(and the midriff over the liver, and over the kidneys, it shall he take away.)<br>
and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 3: 3-5 NLT<br>
3 The priest must present part of this peace offering as a special gift to the Lord. This includes all the fat around the internal organs,<br>
4 the two kidneys and the fat around them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver. These must be removed with the kidneys,<br>
5 and Aaron's sons will burn them on top of the burnt offering on the wood burning on the altar. It is a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.<br>

Galatians 5: 19-21 (KJV)<br>
5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,<br>
5:20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,<br>
5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 19-21 NLT<br>
19 When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures,<br>
20 idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarrelling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division,<br>
21 envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.<br>

<br>
Micah 5: 9-15 NLT<br>
9<br>

11<br>
I will tear down your walls<br>
and demolish your defences.<br>
12<br>
I will put an end to all witchcraft,<br>

13<br>
I will destroy all your idols and sacred pillars,<br>

1 Samuel 15: 23 & 24 (KJV)<br>

15:24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.<br>

Rebellion is as sinful as witchcraft,<br>

So because you have rejected the command of the Lord,<br>
he has rejected you as king."<br>

Then Saul admitted to Samuel, "Yes, I have sinned. I have disobeyed your instructions and the Lord's command, for I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded.<br>

never sacrifice your son or daughter as a burnt offering. And do not let your people practice fortune-telling, or use sorcery, or interpret omens, or engage in witchcraft,<br>
11 or cast spells, or function as mediums or psychics, or call forth the spirits of the dead.<br>
12 Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord. It is because the other nations have done these detestable things that the Lord your God will drive them out ahead of you.<br>
13 But you must be blameless before the Lord your God.<br>
14 The nations you are about to displace consult sorcerers and fortune-tellers, but the Lord your God forbids you to do such things."<br>

Isaiah 8:19-22 (KJV)<br>

8:20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.<br>
(it is because there is no morning in them.)<br>
8:21 And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.<br>
8:22 And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 8:19-22 NLT<br>
19 Someone may say to you, "Let's ask the mediums and those who consult the spirits of the dead. With their whisperings and mutterings, they will tell us what to do." But shouldn't people ask God for guidance? Should the living seek guidance from the dead?<br>
20 Look to God's instructions and teachings! People who contradict his word are completely in the dark.<br>
21 They will go from one place to another, weary and hungry. And because they are hungry, they will rage and curse their king and their God. They will look up to heaven<br>
22 and down at the earth, but wherever they look, there will be trouble and anguish and dark despair. They will be thrown out into the darkness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 21: 1-12 (KJV)<br>

21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br>
21:3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.<br>
21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.<br>
21:5 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.<br>
21:6 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.<br>
21:7 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.<br>
21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<br>
21:9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.<br>
21:10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,<br>
21:11 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;<br>
21:12 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 21: 1-14 NLT<br>
1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the old heaven and the old earth had disappeared. And the sea was also gone.<br>
2 And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.<br>
3 I heard a loud shout from the throne, saying, "Look, God's home is now among his people! He will live with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them.<br>
4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain. All these things are gone forever."<br>
5 And the one sitting on the throne said, "Look, I am making everything new!" And then he said to me, "Write this down, for what I tell you is trustworthy and true."<br>
6 And he also said, "It is finished! I am the Alpha and the Omega -- the Beginning and the End. To all who are thirsty I will give freely from the springs of the water of life.<br>
7 All who are victorious will inherit all these blessings, and I will be their God, and they will be my children.<br>
8 "But cowards, unbelievers, the corrupt, murderers, the immoral, those who practice witchcraft, idol worshipers, and all liars -- their fate is in the fiery lake of burning sulphur. This is the second death."<br>
9 Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls containing the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come with me! I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."<br>
10 So he took me in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and he showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.<br>
11 It shone with the glory of God and sparkled like a precious stone -- like jasper as clear as crystal.<br>
12 The city wall was broad and high, with twelve gates guarded by twelve angels. And the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written on the gates.<br>
13 There were three gates on each side -- east, north, south, and west.<br>
14 The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<br>

There was a really beautiful song that I wanted to mention to you, that was released back in 2003, by Paul Wright.<br>
His surname is spelled, W r i g h t.<br>
<br>
In August 2021, Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia,<br>
introduced Paul Wright by saying this about him...<br>
Paul Wright is an American musician originally from Eugene, Oregon.<br>
His debut album, Fly Away, was recorded in Oregon with Christopher Stevens and released in 2003.<br>
Paul Wright graduated from Northwest Christian University (now known as, Bushnell University, in Eugene, Oregon) with a degree in Communications after spending a semester studying at the Contemporary Music Centre in Martha's Vineyard.<br>
<br>
His recent, 2008 album is titled, Diego's Diary. He is also on the tobyMac's albums, Welcome to Diverse City and Renovating Diverse City. He was signed to Gotee Records. In October 2009, he led a song-writing workshop in Thailand.<br>
<br>
Paul Wright also recently released some singles which were custom songs he wrote for his fans. He offers his fans the opportunity to purchase an original song in which he writes and records their story for them.<br>
<br>
Wright is also the singer in Rootdown, a rock band from Eugene, Oregon. Singer/songwriter and personal friend, Mat Kearney, is also an American musician born in Eugene, Oregon who had the Christian hit, Undeniable, in 2004.<br>
Mat Kearney co-wrote with Wright his parts as the narrator of the rock opera, Hero. His character was named Agent Hunter. He worked for I.C.O.N. as an undercover agent, but later joined Hero, played by Michael Tait (who is the current lead singer of Newsboys, and one third of Christian rock group, DC Talk).<br>
Paul Wright has been featured on albums by tobyMac, LA Symphony, Falling Up, and Shawn McDonald.<br>
<br>
<br>
As of August 2021, Paul Wright had released one EP, followed by seven albums.<br>
On his first album, titled, Fly Away, released back in 2003, there is a great Christian song on there, titled, You're Beautiful.<br>
<br>
The song was released as a single and was played on American Christian radio networks, and on Christian Hit and Christian Rock music networks.<br>
A Remix Edit was made and released as the single.  Although the Radio Mix edit had an interesting sound, unfortunately,<br>
the ending part of the song, where he sings the song's title, was not included in the remixed edit that was released to radio networks.<br>
The Radio Mix has a stronger emphasis on guitars and the drum beat, but the Album version has the longer ending where the title of the song is sang.<br>
<br>
From his first album, Fly Away, here are the words to the 2003 song, You're Beautiful, by Paul Wright.<br>
<br>
<br>
The world is watching us from a distance<br>
Wanting more from their own existence<br>
Tell me how do we make a difference for<br>
eternity<br>
Does anybody want to know why we're alive?<br>
<br>
Oh<br>
What's the purpose of this life?<br>
Oh<br>
<br>
Before I die and I leave the world behind<br>
I want to know why I'm alive<br>
<br>
You're all created for the creator<br>
to live inside<br>
There's a hole in your soul and I know that you try<br>
To fill it<br>
with every little thing but the very one who can<br>
heal it<br>
And bring hope to a world that wants to know why they're alive<br>
<br>
Oh<br>
What's the purpose of this life?<br>
Oh<br>
<br>
Before I die and I leave the world behind<br>
I want to know why I'm alive<br>
<br>
Spirit cry for this generation, generation<br>
We're chasing the wind<br>
trying to embrace it<br>
Open our eyes<br>
why all the lies that we try to justify<br>
when deep down inside All we want to find is<br>
someone that loves us all of the time<br>
That is you<br>
it is you, you, O Lord.<br>
<br>
Only you<br>
<br>
Yeah, it's you, O Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
You're beautiful<br>
came down from heaven just to save my, save my soul<br>
Beautiful<br>
Oh!<br>
You're so<br>
beautiful<br>
The people of this world are praising you and they are<br>
Beautiful<br>
Oh!<br>
<br>
You're so<br>
beautiful<br>
came down from heaven just save my, save my soul<br>
Beautiful<br>
Oh.<br>
Oh.<br>
<br>
Now I am<br>
beautiful<br>
Oh.<br>
Oh.<br>
now we're so<br>
beautiful<br>
Oh.<br>
so<br>
beautiful<br>

As the beating of cream yields butter and striking the nose causes bleeding, so stirring up anger causes quarrels.<br>
<br>
James 4:1 (NLT)<br>
What is causing the quarrels and fights among you? Don't they come from the evil desires at war within you?<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2:24 (NLT)<br>
A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people.<br>
<br>
Titus 3:9 (NLT)<br>
Do not get involved in foolish discussions about spiritual pedigrees or in quarrels and fights about obedience to Jewish laws. These things are useless and a waste of time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a Christian Rock band that my family has particularly enjoyed over the years, and it is the band known as Family Force 5.<br>
<br>
They have one song that contains some very powerful and important lyrics that are worth sharing with you here.<br>
We will look at those song lyrics here, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
Some of their songs contain some important Christian truths.  One of their early songs in 2006, Drama Queen, touches on the dangers of rumours, gossip, whisperers and talebearing.<br>
<br>
Sometimes they have silly songs.  We have enjoyed some of their live concert performances where they get the entire audience to stand up and do a dance move that imitates the movements of trying to get a gasoline-powered chainsaw to start up.<br>
<br>
and they would sing,<br>
Bow to the knees, yeah, crank it like a chainsaw<br>
Crank it, crank it, crank it back<br>
<br>
They definitely know how to provide a very fun and entertaining live concert experience.<br>
<br>
Here are some other basic details about the band, Family Force 5, as mentioned back in August 2021, on the webpage of Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia.<br>
FF5 (formerly known as Family Force 5, The Phamily, Ground Noise and The Brothers) is an American Christian rock band from Atlanta, Georgia, formed in 2005.<br>
<br>
As of August 2021, they have released four studio albums, one Christmas album, and three remix albums.<br>
Some of their songs released as singles, included, Cray Button (featuring Lecrae) which was released in 2012,<br>
and Chainsaw (featuring Tedashii) which came out in 2013.<br>
The one we will look at now, is a song called, Let It Be Love, which was also released as a single in 2014, and is on their fourth album, Time Stands Still.<br>
<br>
From their album, Time Stands Still, here are the words to their 2014 song, Let It Be Love, from the band, Family Force 5,<br>
known today as F F 5...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I've never seen a soul set free<br>
Through an argument<br>
I've never seen a hurt get healed<br>
In a protest<br>
But I've seen sinners turned to saints<br>
Because of grace<br>
It's love, love that lights the way<br>
Love that lights the way<br>
<br>
<br>
It's not about the stand we take<br>
But the grace we give<br>
It's not about the name we make<br>
But the life we live<br>
Heard about a King who stepped down<br>
Took my place<br>
True love gave His life away<br>
It's love that lights the way<br>
<br>
<br>
Let it be our arms wide open<br>
Bigger than the words we've spoken<br>
Let it be a heart for the broken<br>
If we're gonna light, light<br>
Light the way to you<br>
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah<br>
Nothin' but love, nothin' but love, yeah<br>
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah<br>
It's love that lights the way<br>
<br>
<br>
Stronger than every fear<br>
Comfort for all the tears<br>
It's where the war is won<br>
And it has overcome<br>
Louder than the loudest shout<br>
Deeper than the deepest doubt<br>
We'll watch the walls fall down<br>
We'll watch the walls fall down<br>
<br>
<br>
Let it be our arms wide open<br>
Bigger than the words we've spoken<br>
Let it be a heart for the broken<br>
If we're gonna light, light<br>
Light the way to you<br>
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah<br>
Nothin' but love, nothin' but love, yeah<br>
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah<br>
It's love that lights the way<br>
<br>
<br>
It's love that lights the way<br>
Yeah, Love that lights the way<br>

Psalms 119:105 (GNV)<br>
Thy word is a lantern unto my feet, and a light unto my path.<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:105 KJV<br>

This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.<br>

1 John 4:16 KJV<br>
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<br>

<br>
Previously, we were looking at a verse in Titus 3. Let's take a look at that area again, a little more closely this time.<br>
<br>
Titus 3:9-11 KJV<br>
3:9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.<br>
3:10 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;<br>
3:11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.<br>
<br>
Titus 3:9-11 NLT<br>
9 Do not get involved in foolish discussions about (spiritual genealogies,) spiritual pedigrees or in quarrels and fights about obedience to Jewish laws. These things are useless and a waste of time.<br>
10 If people are causing divisions among you, give a first and second warning. After that, have nothing more to do with them.<br>
11 For people like that have turned away from the truth, and their own sins condemn them.<br>
<br>
Titus 3:9-11 (TS2009)<br>
9 But keep away from foolish questions, and genealogies, and strife and quarrels about the Torah, for they are unprofitable and useless.<br>
10 Reject a divisive man after the first and second warning,<br>
11 knowing that such a one has been perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.<br>
<br>
Titus 3:9-11 NIV<br>
9 But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless.<br>
10 Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them.<br>
11 You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8:1 KJV<br>
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Conviction is healthy, but not condemnation. If someone is self-condemned with condemnation, they are not in Christ Jesus.<br>
They are walking in the flesh and not in the Spirit.<br>
They are trying to produce the works of the flesh, instead of the Fruit of the Spirit.<br>
<br>
Looking again at Titus 3:10 -- in the KJV, we see this word,<br>
The KJV spells it like this,<br>
heretick<br>
<br>
Today, we would spell it like this:<br>
heretic<br>
<br>
Let's look at the original Greek word that was right there.<br>
If this book was originally created in Hebrew, we do not yet have the original Hebrew at this time.<br>
So, the closest thing we have in August 2021 is a Hebrew to Greek translation which was eventually translated into the KJV.<br>
The ancient Greek would have been said like this:<br>
Hair-Ray-Tea-Caws<br>
In the Greek language today, it might be pronounced like this:<br>
Al-Fal-Leh-Tick-Ohs<br>
<br>
Let's gather some information about this Greek word used here.<br>
We will consult the following reference material and merge the results together into one overall definition.<br>
we will gather the results found from the<br>
Strong's Greek and Hebrew Dictionary<br>
The Greek-English lexicon by John Jeffrey Dodson (as it was published in 2010)<br>
Strong's Greek Dictionary provided by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen from Michael Grier.<br>
Thayer's Lexicon prepared by Alan Bunning at the Centre for New Testament Restoration. -- and, the<br>
Tyndale Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Greek (known simply as the TBESG) - published by the Tyndale House, in Cambridge.<br>
<br>
Hair-Ray-Tea-Caws<br>
or, as we would say today,<br>
Al-Fal-Leh-Tick-Ohs<br>
means,<br>
a schismatic, heretic<br>
fitted or able to take or choose a thing<br>
schismatic, factious, a follower of a false doctrine<br>
capable of choosing<br>
causing division, heretical, factious<br>
disposed to form sects, sectarian, heretical, to belong to a sect<br>
able to choose<br>
(as in choosing parts and pieces of the Bible, and ignoring or rejecting the rest of the Bible)<br>
(removing or avoiding parts that are in the Bible, and replacing those truths with not-in-the-bible)<br>
(as in choosing and selecting only parts and pieces of the truth, and ignoring or rejecting the entire truth)<br>
<br>
<br>
In August 2021, the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries<br>
define the word, heretic, as...<br>
someone who has a belief that disagrees with the official principles of a particular religion<br>
someone who has a belief, statement etc that disagrees with what a group of people believe to be right<br>
someone who believes in and endorses heresy.<br>
someone who has views and opinions that conflict with those of the majority.<br>
someone who has an opinion or belief contrary to the authorised teaching of the religious community to which one ostensibly belongs<br>
an opinion opposed to the conventional or traditional belief<br>
someone who has an opinion that is opposite to or against the official or popular opinion<br>
someone who has beliefs that are against the principles of a particular religion<br>
A heretic is someone whose beliefs or actions are considered wrong by most people, because they disagree with beliefs that are generally accepted.<br>
A heretic is a person who belongs to a particular religion, but whose beliefs or actions seriously disagree with the principles of that religion.<br>
a person who believes in or practises religious heresy<br>
a person who believes in a belief or an opinion that is against the principles of a particular religion; the fact of holding such beliefs<br>
<br>
<br>
In August 2021, the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries<br>
define the word, sect, as...<br>
a group of people with their own particular set of beliefs and practices, especially within or separated from a larger religious group<br>
a religious or other group whose views and practices differ from those of an established body or from those of a body from which it has separated, used sometimes as an expression of disapproval by non-members.<br>
a subdivision of one of the main religious divisions of mankind.<br>
a body of followers of any doctrine, especially of an extreme political movement.<br>
a religious group that has separated from a larger religion and is considered to have extreme or unusual beliefs or customs<br>
A sect is a group of people that has separated from a larger group and has a particular set of religious or political beliefs.<br>
A sect is a small group of people who belong to a particular religion but who have some beliefs or practices which separate them from the rest of the group<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Who's the sect? Who's really right and true? The vast majority that never read, study or obey the Bible?<br>
Or the very small group that's trying to obey God's commandments?<br>
When your body dies, and you're standing before the one who sits on the throne,<br>
does he make his eternal decision about you based on your personal comments and beliefs, or based on the popular majority, or what is actually said in the Bible?<br>
The universe operates only by the set of rules and laws spoken by the Heavenly Father who sits on the throne forever and ever.<br>
Change direction, and start doing it the right way.  Don't do it your way, do it Yaw's way. Read your Bible, all of it, all 66 books, and do what it says, obey it, and pray to him with meekness and fear, and talk to him as though you were talking to your friend.<br>
Obey the entire Bible, read your Bible and pray, Every. Single. Day!<br>
If you have not read the entire Old Testament and the entire New Testament in the last 5 years, then maybe you should read it again.<br>
If you want to read the Bible and understand it easily in English, try the NLT and the KJV both at the same time, and when you are all done doing that, reading from cover to cover, then get an Eth Cepher and read all of that, -- Pray that Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, will enter into you and fill you with his Holy Spirit, and it is that Holy Spirit that will give you the strength and ability to study and obey all of the commandments in the entire Bible!<br>
How do you get saved?  Do what it says in Romans 10:9 -- How do you know you are saved?  You will want to read, study, keep, guard, obey and do the entire Bible, including all of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament!<br>
Read your Bible and pray, every single day. Then, obey it and do what it says, and you'll be OK, forever.<br>
