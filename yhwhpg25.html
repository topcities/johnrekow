Psalms 139: 23 & 24 (NLT)<br>
23<br>
Search me, O God, and know my heart;<br>
test me and know my anxious thoughts.<br>
24<br>
Point out anything in me that offends you,<br>
and lead me along the path of everlasting life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 32:23 (KJV)<br>
But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.<br>
<br>
Numbers 32:23 (NLT)<br>
But if you fail to keep your word, then you will have sinned against the Lord, and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.<br>

<br>
1 Kings 10: 26-28 (KJV)<br>
10:26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.<br>
(And the king gave silver to be in Jerusalem as stones,)<br>
10:27 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.<br>
(And the going forth of the horses which was Solomon's of Egypt,)<br>
10:28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Kings 10: 26-28 NLT<br>
26 Solomon built up a huge force of chariots (charioteers) and horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. He stationed some of them in the chariot cities and some near him in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
27 The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow (in the Shephelah, which is in an area found) in the foothills of Judah.<br>
<br>
28 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Cilicia; the king's traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price.<br>
(It is possible that Solomon's horses were imported from Muzur, a district near Cilicia. The Hebrew name, Kue, is found in this spot here, which may probably be another name for Cilicia.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 1: 15-17 (KJV)<br>
(And the king gave silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones,)<br>
1:15 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that are in the vale for abundance.<br>
(And the going forth of the horses which was Solomons brought out of Egypt,)<br>
1:16 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.<br>
1:17 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means (by their hand).<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 1: 15-17 NLT<br>
15 The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah (in an area known as the Shephelah).<br>
(Solomon's horses were imported from Muzur, a district near Cilicia, and from Kue, which is probably just another name for Cilicia.)<br>
16 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Cilicia; the king's traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price.<br>
17 At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver, (600 shekels of silver, which would weigh about 15 pounds or 6.8 kilograms), and horses for 150 pieces of silver (150 shekels of silver, which would weigh about 3.8 pounds or 1.7 kilograms). They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 9:28 (KJV)<br>
And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 9:28 NLT<br>
28 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt (an area known as Muzur, a district near Cilicia) and many other countries.<br>
<br>

<br>
Titus 1: 6-11 (KJV)<br>
1:6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.<br>
1:7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;<br>
1:8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, (a lover of good things,) sober, just, holy, temperate;<br>
(Holding fast the faithful word in teaching)<br>
1:9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.<br>
1:10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:<br>
1:11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 1: 6-11 NLT<br>
6 An elder must live a blameless life. He must be faithful to his wife,<br>
(He must have only one wife, he must be married only once, he must be the husband of one wife,)<br>
and his children must be believers who don't have a reputation for being wild or rebellious.<br>
7 (An overseer, a bishop,) A church leader is a manager of God's household, so he must live a blameless life.<br>
He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered;<br>
(He must not drink too much wine, and he must not be violent, or dishonest with money.)<br>
he must not be a heavy drinker, violent, or dishonest with money.<br>
<br>
8 Rather, he must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must love what is good. He must live wisely and be just. He must live a devout and disciplined life.<br>
9 He must have a strong belief in the trustworthy message he was taught; then he will be able to encourage others with wholesome teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong.<br>
10 For there are many rebellious people who engage in useless talk and deceive others. This is especially true of those who insist on circumcision for salvation.<br>
11 They must be silenced, because they are turning whole families away from the truth by their false teaching. And they do it only for money.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 3: 1-7 (KJV)<br>
3:1 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.<br>
3:2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, (modest,) of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;<br>
(not ready to quarrel and offer wrong as one in wine)<br>
3:3 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;<br>
3:4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;<br>
3:5 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)<br>
(Not one newly come to the faith)<br>
3:6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.<br>
3:7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 3: 1-7 NLT<br>
1 This is a trustworthy saying:<br>
(If someone aspires to be an overseer, or a bishop, he desires an honourable position.)<br>
"If someone aspires to be a church leader, he desires an honourable position."<br>
2 So a church leader must be a man whose life is above reproach.<br>
<br>
(He must have only one wife, he must be married only once, he must be the husband of one wife, and)<br>
He must be faithful to his wife. He must exercise self-control, live wisely, and have a good reputation. He must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must be able to teach.<br>
<br>
(He must not drink too much wine,)<br>
3 He must not be a heavy drinker or be violent. He must be gentle, not quarrelsome, and not love money.<br>
4 He must manage his own family well, having children who respect and obey him.<br>
5 For if a man cannot manage his own household, how can he take care of God's church?<br>
(A church leader must not be a new believer, because he might fall into the same judgement as the devil.)<br>
6 A church leader must not be a new believer, because he might become proud, and the devil would cause him to fall.<br>
7 Also, people outside the church must speak well of him so that he will not be disgraced and fall into the devil's trap.<br>
<br>

Deuteronomy 17: 14-20 (KJV)<br>
17:14 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;<br>
17:15 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.<br>
17:16 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.<br>
17:17 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.<br>
17:18 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:<br>
17:19 And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:<br>
17:20 That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 17: 14-20 NLT<br>
14 "You are about to enter the land the Lord your God is giving you. When you take it over and settle there, you may think, 'We should select a king to rule over us like the other nations around us.'<br>
15 If this happens, be sure to select as king the man the Lord your God chooses. You must appoint a fellow Israelite; he may not be a foreigner.<br>
16 "The king must not build up a large stable of horses for himself or send his people to Egypt to buy horses, for the Lord has told you, 'You must never return to Egypt.'<br>
17 The king must not take many wives for himself, because they will turn his heart away from the Lord. And he must not accumulate large amounts of wealth in silver and gold for himself.<br>
18 "When he sits on the throne as king, he must copy for himself this body of instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.<br>
19 He must always keep that copy with him and read it daily as long as he lives. That way he will learn to fear the Lord his God by obeying all the terms of these instructions and decrees.<br>
20 This regular reading will prevent him from becoming proud and acting as if he is above his fellow citizens. It will also prevent him from turning away from these commands in the smallest way. And it will ensure that he and his descendants will reign for many generations in Israel.<br>

From the website, Targum.info -- English Translation of Targumic Texts:<br>
The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan Ben Uzziel On the Pentateuch<br>
First Five Old Testament Books of Targumim -- Pentateuchal Targumim<br>
(English Translation, First Published in 1862, by J. W. Etheridge, M.A.)<br>
Deuteronomy 17: 14-20<br>
Because it is a paraphrased recollection of Torah, being recalled from one's memory as they create the translation, it has expanded descriptions, expanded explanations, and some commentaries,<br>
all included in the recalled-from-memory, paraphrased translation.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this area of scripture,<br>
Deuteronomy 17: 14-20<br>
in the Targums, the Targumic Text contains content<br>
that is in violation of scripture commandment accuracy, and is wrong, incorrect, and not in alignment and agreement with Torah as originally written by Moses.<br>
The Bible very clearly does not specify the added content published here in the Targums.<br>
As a result, we will not be reading these verses in the Targum, as it is clearly inaccurate, wrong and false.<br>
Usually, the Targumic Text is generally an interesting resource to read and consider, but not this time.<br>
<br>
Well, at least we took a look at it, and considered it, to see if it could be a useful resource to contribute to the study, here today.<br>
It was not this time.  Maybe we will consider this Targum.info resource again another day.<br>
Let's go back to where we were earlier, in 1 Kings 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's read this next part again, in 1 Kings 10, but this time, we will keep reading into chapter 11.<br>
1 Kings 10: starting again in verse 26, and we keep reading into the next chapter, stopping at chapter 11, verse 14. (KJV)<br>
10:26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.<br>
(And the king gave silver to be in Jerusalem as stones,)<br>
10:27 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.<br>
(And the going forth of the horses which was Solomons of Egypt,)<br>
10:28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.<br>
11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women,<br>
(besides the daughter of Pharaoh)<br>
together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites;<br>
11:2 Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.<br>
11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.<br>
11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.<br>
11:5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.<br>
11:6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD,<br>
(and fulfilled not after the LORD,) as did David his father.<br>
11:7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.<br>
11:8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.<br>
11:9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,<br>
11:10 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.<br>
11:11 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee,<br>
(Forasmuch as this is with thee,)<br>
and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.<br>
11:12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.<br>
11:13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.<br>
11:14 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Kings 10:21, and we keep on reading again until we get to 1 Kings 11:14 -- NLT<br>
21 All of King Solomon's drinking cups were solid gold, as were all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. They were not made of silver, for silver was considered worthless in Solomon's day!<br>
22 The king had a fleet of trading ships of Tarshish that sailed with Hiram's fleet.<br>
Once every three years the ships returned, loaded with gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks (and baboons).<br>
<br>
23 So King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king on earth.<br>
24 People from every nation came to consult him and to hear the wisdom God had given him.<br>
25 Year after year everyone who visited brought him gifts of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.<br>
26 Solomon built up a huge force of chariots (charioteers) and horses. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. He stationed some of them in the chariot cities and some near him in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
27 The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow (in the Shephelah, which is in an area found) in the foothills of Judah.<br>
<br>
28 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Cilicia; the king's traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price.<br>
(It is possible that Solomon's horses were imported from Muzur, a district near Cilicia. The Hebrew name, Kue, is found in this spot here, which may probably be another name for Cilicia.)<br>
<br>
29 At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver, and horses for 150 pieces of silver. They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.<br>
<br>
(At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 shekels of silver, which is about 15 pounds or 6.8 kilograms in weight, and horses from Egypt could be purchased for 150 shekels of silver, which would be about 3.8 pounds or 1.7 kilograms in weight. They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram.)<br>
<br>
1 Now King Solomon loved many foreign women. Besides Pharaoh's daughter, he married women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and from among the Hittites.<br>
2 The Lord had clearly instructed the people of Israel, "You must not marry them, because they will turn your hearts to their gods." Yet Solomon insisted on loving them anyway.<br>
3 He had 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines. And in fact, they did turn his heart away from the Lord.<br>
4 In Solomon's old age, they turned his heart to worship other gods instead of being completely faithful to the Lord his God, as his father, David, had been.<br>
5 Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and (Milcom, also known as) Molech, the detestable god of the Ammonites.<br>
<br>
6 In this way, Solomon did what was evil in the Lord's sight; he refused to follow the Lord completely, as his father, David, had done.<br>
<br>
7 (On the mountain east of Jerusalem,) On the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, he even built a pagan shrine for Chemosh, the detestable god of Moab, and another for Molech, the detestable god of the Ammonites.<br>
8 Solomon built such shrines for all his foreign wives to use for burning incense and sacrificing to their gods.<br>
9 The Lord was very angry with Solomon, for his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.<br>
10 He had warned Solomon specifically about worshiping other gods, but Solomon did not listen to the Lord's command.<br>
11 So now the Lord said to him, "Since you have not kept my covenant and have disobeyed my decrees, I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your servants.<br>
12 But for the sake of your father, David, I will not do this whilst you are still alive. I will take the kingdom away from your son.<br>
13 And even so, I will not take away the entire kingdom; I will let him be king of one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, my chosen city."<br>
14 Then the Lord raised up Hadad the Edomite, a member of Edom's royal family, to be Solomon's adversary.<br>

Commentary:<br>
There are two attitudes that one can have.<br>
How close can I get into the pit of sin without falling in?<br>
How much sin can I dabble in before it affects me?<br>
How much touching and kissing can I do with a woman that I am not married to before it becomes adultery?<br>
<br>
That is one attitude.<br>
The opposite would be, how hard can I study the Bible, and obey and do what it says?<br>
How about, no kissing, no touching, until after we are officially, publicly married and then we are on our honeymoon?<br>
Obey and do the seven feasts of the Lord, don't do Christmas, Saturday always was the day of rest, not Sunday.<br>
If you think Sunday is the day of rest, then you are believing a lie.<br>
Stop eating pig. Wear four blue reminder strings. Obey the commandments, and teach them to your children.<br>
Remember the put-away list and always be on the lookout for those items that you should always put away,<br>
especially the one that says, put away ALL anger, not some, not half, not most, but all anger.<br>
Forgive everyone who has ever hurt you, or you will not be forgiven.<br>
<br>
Yes, you can be addicted to this or that, and have struggles and strongholds with this sin and that sin, and still go to Heaven,<br>
but, why settle for just barely OK?  What if we were to take these standards, and try to apply them to ourselves?<br>
Why settle for just barely, tolerably acceptable? Stop being selfish. It's not about you.<br>
We exist to give God pleasure.  That is why we exist.<br>
We were created for his pleasure.<br>
<br>
Repeating again what we read in Chapter Zero, Bonus study number 10...<br>
<br>
Revelation 4:11 (KJV)<br>
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:13 (KJV)<br>
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If we want the Lord to use us, for his pleasure, how can we do that?<br>
These additional standards are for those that are wanting God to place them in positions of spiritual leadership.<br>
They are all positions of people leading a nation, and leading a people, as a nation, as a community, as a church of believers.<br>
<br>
Do I qualify?  We are all given different sets of skills, talents, giftings, powers and abilities.<br>
Not everyone is given the leadership capabilities.<br>
How can we tell if someone qualifies to be a spiritual leader?  These standards that we just read are a great list of qualifications.<br>
Likewise, if someone who has been a leader of a church, suddenly is found to be in violation of these standards, and is trying to operate in opposition to these standards, ignoring these standards,<br>
they need to resign, and quit trying to be something that they are not anymore.<br>
The Lord sees, and all of their secrets are naked and open.<br>
Secret thoughts, secret fantasies, what you look at and click on when no one is looking.  He is looking.  He is the God who sees.<br>
Secret imaginations, secret plans and intentions, secret memories.<br>
Secret rings, secret clubs, secret societies, secret brotherhoods.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 32:23 (KJV)<br>
But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:13 (KJV)<br>
13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:13 NLT:<br>
13 Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he is the one to whom we are accountable.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5:11 (KJV)<br>
And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5:11 (NLT)<br>
Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them.<br>
<br>
(Ephesians) 5:11 (TS2009)<br>
And have no fellowship with the fruitless works of darkness, but rather convict them.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
So, when someone no longer qualifies, they need to stop being in their position of leadership.<br>
The standards we were reading a moment ago, those are the qualifications, to determine and decide if someone can start being in leadership,<br>
and they continue to be the standards today that determine if someone should or should not continue to be in church leadership.<br>
The Lord Yaw-Who-Wah himself is very good at putting people into leadership, and he is also very good at forcibly removing those who need to be taken out of positions of leadership.<br>
He hires, and he fires.  He promotes and he sacks. He brings church leaders in and he takes them out if they don't leave when they should.<br>
<br>
Fake and phoney anti-Christs are turning whole families away from the truth by their false teaching.<br>
And they do it only for money. (this is a quote from what we just saw in Titus 1:11 NLT)<br>
The Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah will someday take all that is wrong and make it right.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 2:7 (KJV)<br>
The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: He bringeth low, and lifteth up<br>
<br>
(1 Samuel) 2:7 (TS2009)<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah makes poor and makes rich, He brings low and lifts up.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 2:7 (NLT)<br>
The Lord makes some poor and others rich; he brings some down and lifts others up.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, if anyone wants to have the future possibility of someday being used by the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah in a position of spiritual, church and Torah teaching and leadership,<br>
<br>
Let's consider again, some of the standards that are used to see if we can qualify to be in leadership someday.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, help those that are called to meet and exceed these standards all the days of their lives, help them do so.<br>
And, if anyone is no longer capable of maintaining these standards, may they honestly and voluntarily resign.<br>
Give us all the wisdom, skill and understanding in these kinds of things, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
Here are some selected parts and pieces from the Bible verses that we read earlier.<br>
Should I try to meet or exceed these standards?  Should you?<br>
Do I want to be considered a possible candidate for church and bible teaching leadership?<br>
Does the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah want to use you or use me in a position of leadership for a group of believers?<br>
Do you ever want Him to use You like this?<br>
Just in case He does present the opportunity, and He puts it upon your heart to be prepared for a leadership role someday, would you want to strive for these higher standards and expectations of a person who needs to be in a leadership role?<br>
Do you ever want to be used like that?  Just in case he might want you or me to say, Yes, I want to try to exceed these additional standards...<br>
Here I am, send me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 6:8 (NLT)<br>
Then I heard the Lord asking, "Whom should I send as a messenger to this people? Who will go for us?" I said, "Here I am. Send me."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Grabbing bits and pieces from the KJV and NLT verses that we read earlier...<br>
A church leader should be the following...<br>
the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.<br>
patient, not a brawler, not covetous;<br>
be faithful to his wife, have only one wife<br>
his children must be believers who don't have a reputation for being wild or rebellious.<br>
One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;<br>
<br>
Not one newly come to the faith<br>
Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride<br>
A church leader must not be a new believer, because he might become proud,<br>
and the devil would cause him to fall.<br>
<br>
<br>
he must live a blameless life<br>
he must have a good report of them which are without<br>
not self-willed, (not selfish, not quick to get angry, but slow to get angry)<br>
not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, (he does not start fights nor get in to fights and arguments)<br>
He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered; He must not drink too much wine,<br>
he must not be a heavy drinker,<br>
he must not be violent, or dishonest with money.<br>
not quarrelsome, and not love money<br>
a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, (a lover of good things,) sober, just, holy, temperate;<br>
he must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must love what is good.<br>
He must live wisely and be just.<br>
encourage others with wholesome teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong<br>
<br>
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught<br>
<br>
He must teach against the many rebellious people who engage in useless talk and deceive others.<br>
He must teach against those that insist on circumcision for salvation<br>
They must be silenced, because they are turning whole families away from the truth by their false teaching.<br>
And they do it only for money.<br>
<br>
Commentary: What would horses be today, symbolically?  Cars, vehicles, objects, possessions in general?<br>
he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt,<br>
(He must not cause the people to return to the world, and the worldly ways)<br>
(he must not cause the people to want to return to the world, and the worldly ways)<br>
(we are to be holy and set-apart, not merged and mixed, we are not in this together, we are called not to coexist)<br>
(coexist does not exist in the Bible)<br>
(we are peculiar, holy and set-apart, because He is holy)<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 20:26 (KJV)<br>
And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.<br>
<br>
Leviticus 20:26 (NLT)<br>
You must be holy because I, the Lord, am holy. I have set you apart from all other people to be my very own.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Grabbing the rest of the bits and pieces from the KJV and NLT verses that we read earlier...<br>
A church leader, or, in these parts here, a king should obey and do the following...<br>
Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, (men who have more than one wife can not be in leadership)<br>
write him a copy of this law<br>
And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life:<br>
'You must never return to Egypt.'<br>
Commentary:<br>
(You must never return to the world, the worldly ways and the world system, the Beast system)<br>
don't go back, don't even look back, remember Lot's wife!<br>
he must not accumulate large amounts of wealth in silver and gold for himself.<br>
He must not be selfish with his wealth, he must not be a hoarder.<br>
Share with those in need.<br>
He must read all of Torah daily as long as he lives, and obey it.<br>
He must never think or act as if he is above his fellow citizens.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:18 KJV<br>
Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:18 (NLT)<br>
Pride goes before destruction, and haughtiness before a fall.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:18 (GNV)<br>
Pride goeth before destruction, and an high mind before the fall.<br>
<br>
<br>
We now bring this Bible study to a conclusion, by looking at two final passages...<br>
<br>
Philippians 2: 3-5 NLT<br>
3 Don't be selfish; don't try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves.<br>
4 Don't look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.<br>
5 You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 20: 25-28 NLT<br>
25 But Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people, and officials flaunt their authority over those under them.<br>
26 But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant,<br>
27 and whoever wants to be first among you must become your slave.<br>
28 For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many."<br>

This is just a quick, little Bible study, where we look at verses that talk about blasphemy against the Holy Spirit,<br>
and then we will look at the moment when Jesus breathes the Holy Spirit into the disciples, and they receive the Spirit, the wind, the Breath that is set-apart, and holy, the set-apart breath of Yaw.<br>

Matthew 12: 29-33 -- King James Version (KJV)<br>
12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.<br>
12:30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.<br>

Matthew 12: 29-33 -- New Living Translation (NLT)<br>
29 For who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods? Only someone even stronger -- someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house.<br>
30 "Anyone who isn't with me opposes me, and anyone who isn't working with me is actually working against me.<br>
31 "So I tell you, every sin and blasphemy can be forgiven -- except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which will never be forgiven.<br>
32 Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to come.<br>

29 And how will one be able to enter into the house of the strong and mighty man --<br>
and to break it if he does not first bind him by power? And afterwards he can rob him of his house.<br>
30 Whosoever is not with me is against me. And whosoever does not gather with me, scatters against me.<br>
31 And in this respect I say to you that an iniquity of a curse will be atoned for the men,<br>
except whosoever says a curse against Roo-Awk Hawk-Coh-Desh (The Spirit that is Holy, the Set-Apart Spirit).<br>
32 For whosoever speaks against Roo-Awk Hawk-Coh-Desh (The Spirit that is Holy, the Set-Apart Spirit)<br>

Version 1.1 -- May 2020<br>
Mark 3: 24-29<br>
<br>
24 And if any kingdom is without the wisdom, is that kingdom able to stand?<br>
25 In a household which has division of the heart among them, no one is able to endure.<br>
(In a household which has division of the heart among them, no one is able to keep himself standing.)<br>
<br>
26 And if Haw-Saw-Tawn (and if satan, The Adversary) rises up against himself, he is divided, and he is not able to stand, but<br>
there will come an end to him.<br>

(Haw-Saw-Tawn is the way how you pronounce the Hebrew word, Ha-Satan.<br>
Haw-Saw-Tawn literally means, "The Adversary" -- because it is often used as a name in these gospels,<br>
the Hebrew New Testament to English Translation team decided to have the name transliterated,<br>
instead of translating it, as with all other Hebrew names.)<br>
<br>
<br>
27 No man is able to enter into the house of the strong and to steal the vessels if he does not first bind him, and then he can rob the house.<br>
28 Truly I am saying to you that<br>
(all the iniquities will be covered,)<br>
all the iniquities will be atoned,<br>
29 besides iniquity against Roo-Awk Hawk-Oh-Desh.<br>
This (anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit) is he who does not have hope. This iniquity will not be atoned for ever.<br>
But it is worthy of eternal Nephashith death,<br>
(But This iniquity is worthy of eternal death of one's breath, life, or soul)<br>
(The Hebrew word, Nephashith is An adjective from 'nephesh.'<br>
Nephesh literally means 'breath,' 'life,' or 'soul,' etc. --<br>
This Hebrew word, Nephashith, is not the same thing as the Greek understanding of 'soul'.)<br>

Isaiah 66: 1-4 KJV<br>
66:1 Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?<br>
66:2 For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.<br>
<br>
66:3 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man;<br>
(he that sacrificeth a kid)<br>
he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood;<br>
(he that maketh a memorial of incense, as if he blessed an idol)<br>
he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.<br>
(I also will choose their devices, and will bring their fears upon them)<br>
66:4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 66: 1-4 NLT<br>
1<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Heaven is my throne,<br>
and the earth is my footstool.<br>
Could you build me a temple as good as that?<br>
Could you build me such a resting place?<br>
<br>
(My hands have made both heaven and earth; these things are mine.)<br>
2<br>
My hands have made both heaven and earth;<br>
they and everything in them are mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
I, the Lord, have spoken!<br>
"I will bless those who have humble and contrite hearts,<br>
who tremble at my word.<br>
3<br>
But those who choose their own ways --<br>
delighting in their detestable sins --<br>
will not have their offerings accepted.<br>
When such people sacrifice a bull,<br>
it is no more acceptable than a human sacrifice.<br>
When they sacrifice a lamb,<br>
it's as though they had sacrificed a dog!<br>
When they bring an offering of grain,<br>
they might as well offer the blood of a pig.<br>
When they burn frankincense,<br>
it's as if they had blessed an idol.<br>
4<br>
I will send them great trouble --<br>
all the things they feared.<br>
For when I called, they did not answer.<br>
When I spoke, they did not listen.<br>
They deliberately sinned before my very eyes<br>
and chose to do what they know I despise."<br>

Acts 7: 48-51 KJV<br>
7:48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,<br>
7:49 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?<br>
7:50 Hath not my hand made all these things?<br>
7:51 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts of the Apostles 7: 48-51 NLT<br>
48<br>
However, the Most High doesn't live in temples made by human hands. As the prophet says,<br>
49<br>
'Heaven is my throne,<br>
and the earth is my footstool.<br>
Could you build me a temple as good as that?'<br>
asks the Lord.<br>
'Could you build me such a resting place?<br>
50 Didn't my hands make both heaven and earth?'<br>
(quoting from Isaiah 66: 1 & 2)<br>
<br>
("You stubborn people! You are uncircumcised at heart and deaf to the truth.)<br>
51 "You stubborn people! You are heathen at heart and deaf to the truth. Must you forever resist the Holy Spirit? That's what your ancestors did, and so do you!<br>

Ephesians 4:30 KJV<br>
4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Ephesians) 4:30 (TS2009)<br>
And do not grieve the Set-apart Spirit of ELL-Low-Heem, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:30 NLT<br>
30 And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live.<br>
(Remember, he has put his seal on you,)<br>
Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.<br>

After The Crucifixion, The Death of Jesus, The Burial of Jesus, and<br>
The Resurrection, Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene, then<br>
Jesus Appears to His Disciples...<br>
<br>
John 20: 19-23 KJV<br>
...Jesus...stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.<br>
20:20 And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.<br>
20:21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.<br>
20:22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:<br>
20:23 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 20: 19-23 NLT<br>
(In the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the disciples were meeting behind locked doors.)<br>
19 That Sunday evening the disciples were meeting behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus was standing there among them! "Peace be with you," he said.<br>
20 As he spoke, he showed them the wounds in his hands and his side. They were filled with joy when they saw the Lord!<br>
21 Again he said, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I am sending you."<br>
22 Then he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.<br>
23 If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven. If you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 20: 19-23 (TS2009)<br>
19 When therefore it was evening on that day, day one of the week, and when the doors were shut where the taught ones met, for fear of the Yeh-Who-Dee (the Jewish leaders), Yaw-Who-Shaw came and stood in the midst, and said to them, "Peace to you."<br>
20 And having said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The taught ones therefore rejoiced when they saw the Master.<br>
21 Then Yaw-Who-Shaw said to them again, "Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you."<br>
22 And having said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Set-apart Spirit.<br>
23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained.<br>

John 20: 19-23 -- Van Rensburgs HebrewGospels.com -- Hebrew Gospels from Catalonia, Sepharad (Spain)<br>
Hebrew New Testament to English Translation<br>
A literal translation of a medieval Hebrew manuscript in the Vatican Library,<br>
Translated by the Van Rensburg family<br>
Version 1.1 -- April 2021<br>
<br>
(the word, talmidim is Usually translated as "disciples."<br>
The Hebrew "Talmid" is a student who learns from his teacher and follows his example.<br>
"Talmidim" is the masculine plural form.)<br>
<br>
John 20: 19-23<br>
(Then, on the first day of the week, when it was dusk,<br>
this means that it was almost the second day of the week. The Hebrew 24-hour day starts after dusk.)<br>
<br>
19 Then, on the first day of the week, when it was evening --<br>
and the doors of the house were locked where the talmidim were --<br>
(where the disciples were,)<br>
Yeshua came and said to them, "Shalom lachem!"<br>
(shalom to you)<br>
(this is a Greeting that means, shalom to you, wholeness to you, completeness to you, well-being to you, peace to you, salvation to you)<br>
(Shalom can mean, "wholeness," "completeness" or "well-being," Shalom can also mean 'peace' or even possibly 'salvation'<br>
as it did in John 4:22)<br>
<br>
20 And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side.<br>
So when the talmidim saw Ha-Adon, they rejoiced.<br>
(So when the disciples saw that it was their Master, they rejoiced.)<br>
(Adon is pronounced, Aw-Dawm, and is the Hebrew way of saying, Adam.<br>
Jesus called himself the son of Adam or the Son of Man.<br>
Adon is the Standard Hebrew word for 'Master.'<br>
'Adon' or 'Ha-Adon' is often used for YHWH in quotes from the Old Testament.)<br>
<br>
21 Then he said to them again, "Shalom imachem!"<br>
(shalom be with you)<br>
(this is a Greeting that means, shalom be with you, wholeness be with you, completeness be with you, well-being be with you, peace be with you, salvation be with you)<br>
<br>
<br>
22 When he had said this, he sighed heavily and said to them, "Receive Ruach Ha-Qodesh!<br>
(Receive Roo-Awk Hawk-Oh-Desh)<br>
(Receive the Spirit that is Holy)<br>
(Receive the Set-Apart Spirit!)<br>
23 And to whomsoever you will let go the iniquities, they will be let go for them;<br>
(they will be forgiven)<br>
but to whomsoever you will retain the iniquities, they will be retained for them."<br>

Compare the descriptions of someone seen in the Old Testament and the one seen in the New Testament.<br>
It sounds like it is the same Son of Man in both books, the book of Daniel, and the book of Revelation.<br>
<br>
Let's look right now at a snip from Daniel's Vision of a Messenger, and then we will see a clip from The Rider on the White Horse.<br>
<br>
Daniel 10: 4-6 (KJV)<br>
10:4 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;<br>
10:5 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man (one man) clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:<br>
10:6 His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Daniel 10: 4-6 happened exactly on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar.<br>
This date in the book of Daniel can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Persian records and can be related accurately to our modern calendar.<br>
As a result, we can accurately say that this event occurred on 23 April 536 BC<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 10: 4-6 NLT<br>
4 On 23 April 536 BC, as I was standing on the bank of the great Tigris River,<br>
5 I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen clothing, with a belt of pure gold around his waist.<br>
6 His body looked like a precious gem. His face flashed like lightning, and his eyes flamed like torches. His arms and feet shone like polished bronze, and his voice roared like a vast multitude of people.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Son of Man is a title Jesus used for himself.)<br>
<br>
Revelation 1: 12-15 (KJV)<br>
1:12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;<br>
(And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like a Son of man,)<br>
1:13 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.<br>
1:14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;<br>
1:15 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  The description of his feet makes him sound like the same extra guy suddenly seen in the furnace in the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.<br>
We actually read that story in Christian Essays 4.<br>
<br>
Revelation 1: 12-15 NLT<br>
12 When I turned to see who was speaking to me, I saw seven gold lampstands.<br>
13 And standing in the middle of the lampstands was someone like the Son of Man. He was wearing a long robe with a gold sash across his chest.<br>
14 His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow. And his eyes were like flames of fire.<br>
15 His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice thundered like mighty ocean waves.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 2:18 (KJV)<br>
...These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;<br>
<br>
Revelation 2:18 (NLT)<br>
...This is the message from the Son of God, whose eyes are like flames of fire, whose feet are like polished bronze:<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 19: 11-13 (KJV)<br>
19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.<br>
19:12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.<br>
19:13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.<br>
<br>
Revelation 19: 11-14 NLT<br>
11 Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. Its rider was named Faithful and True, for he judges fairly and wages a righteous war.<br>
12 His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself.<br>
13 He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title was the Word of God.<br>
14 The armies of heaven, dressed in the finest of pure white linen, followed him on white horses.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
I want to see Your eyes like fire<br>
I want to see the scars that bled<br>
Jesus will You take me higher, the place where angels fear to tread<br>
<br>
That is referring to the song, Carry My Soul, from Phil Wickham.<br>
There was one time that he had indicated on his website that the lyrics were supposed to be, Eyes like fire,<br>
but, when he sings the song, instead of singing, I want to see Your Eyes like fire<br>
he actually ends up singing, I want to see You rise like fire.<br>
We will read all the words to that song here, in just a moment.<br>

<br>
1 Samuel 13: 5-14 (KJV)<br>
5 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.<br>
6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.<br>
<br>
<br>
7 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.<br>
(As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people trembled after him.)<br>
<br>
8 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.<br>
9 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.<br>
10 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.<br>
(and Saul went out to meet him, that he might bless him.)<br>
<br>
11 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;<br>
<br>
(Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the face of the Lord: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.)<br>
<br>
12 Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the Lord: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.<br>
13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.<br>
14 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 13: 5-14 (NLT)<br>
<br>
(The Philistines mustered a mighty army of 30,000 chariots,)<br>
5 The Philistines mustered a mighty army of 3,000 chariots, 6,000 charioteers, and as many warriors as the grains of sand on the seashore! They camped at Micmash east of Beth-aven.<br>
6 The men of Israel saw what a tight spot they were in; and because they were hard pressed by the enemy, they tried to hide in caves, thickets, rocks, holes, and cisterns.<br>
7 Some of them crossed the Jordan River and escaped into the land of Gad and Gilead.<br>
Meanwhile, Saul stayed at Gilgal, and his men were trembling with fear.<br>
8 Saul waited there seven days for Samuel, as Samuel had instructed him earlier, but Samuel still didn't come. Saul realised that his troops were rapidly slipping away.<br>
9 So he demanded, "Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings!" And Saul sacrificed the burnt offering himself.<br>
10 Just as Saul was finishing with the burnt offering, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to meet and welcome him,<br>
11 but Samuel said, "What is this you have done?"<br>
Saul replied, "I saw my men scattering from me, and you didn't arrive when you said you would, and the Philistines are at Micmash ready for battle.<br>
12 So I said, ‘The Philistines are ready to march against us at Gilgal, and I haven't even asked for the Lord's help!' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering myself before you came."<br>
13 "How foolish!" Samuel exclaimed. "You have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you. Had you kept it, the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.<br>
14 But now your kingdom must end, for the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart. The Lord has already appointed him to be the leader of his people, because you have not kept the Lord's command."<br>

Acts 13: 17-23 (KJV)<br>
17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.<br>
18 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.<br>
19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot.<br>
20 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.<br>
21 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.<br>
22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.<br>
23 Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Paul is Preaching in Antioch of Pisidia.<br>
This area was more commonly known as Pamphylia and Pisidia, which were districts in what is now Turkey.<br>
Paul is clearly referring to 1 Samuel 13:14, when he remembers it in verse 22, even though, as we saw when we read it ourselves, David is not actually mentioned by name in 1 Samuel 13:14.<br>
Paul is letting us know here, that, in 1 Samuel 13:14, David, son of Jesse, is a man after God's own heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Book of Acts of the Apostles 13: 14-26 (NLT)<br>
...On the Sabbath they went to the synagogue for the services.<br>
(After the usual readings from the law and the prophets,)<br>
15 After the usual readings from the books of Moses and the prophets, those in charge of the service sent them this message: "Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, come and give it."<br>
16 So Paul stood, lifted his hand to quiet them, and started speaking. "Men of Israel," he said, "and you God-fearing Gentiles, listen to me.<br>
<br>
17 "The God of this nation of Israel chose our ancestors and made them multiply and grow strong during their stay in Egypt. Then with a powerful arm he led them out of their slavery.<br>
<br>
(as it talks about in Deuteronomy 1:31, He cared for them through forty years of wandering in the wilderness.)<br>
18 He put up with them through forty years of wandering in the wilderness.<br>
19 Then he destroyed seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to Israel as an inheritance.<br>
20 All this took about 450 years.<br>
"After that, God gave them judges to rule until the time of Samuel the prophet.<br>
21 Then the people begged for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.<br>
22 But God removed Saul and replaced him with David, a man about whom God said, ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will do everything I want him to do.'<br>
23 "And it is one of King David's descendants, Jesus, who is God's promised Saviour of Israel!<br>
24 Before he came, John the Baptist preached that all the people of Israel needed to repent of their sins and turn to God and be baptised.<br>
25 As John was finishing his ministry he asked, ‘Do you think I am the Messiah? No, I am not! But he is coming soon -- and I'm not even worthy to be his slave and untie the sandals on his feet.'<br>
26 "Brothers -- you sons of Abraham, and also you God-fearing Gentiles -- this message of salvation has been sent to us!<br>

So now, let's take a moment to think about the words to his 2013 song, Carry My Soul, from Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
I want to hear You say well done<br>
I want to be welcomed in<br>
I want to feel Your love like sunshine on my resurrected skin<br>
<br>
I want to hear the music play<br>
I want to hear the trumpet sound<br>
I want to hear You call my name and watch my feet lift off the ground<br>
<br>
<br>
I will run<br>
Oh and I won't quit<br>
Chasing Your heart<br>
Just like David did<br>
I'll come running through the gates<br>
Look into Your face, oh I can hardly wait<br>
Until You carry my soul, carry my soul away<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh<br>
<br>
<br>
When everything is said and done<br>
Death has met its end<br>
I want to hear You call me son, be counted as a faithful friend<br>
<br>
I want to see You rise like fire<br>
I want to see the scars that bled<br>
Oh won't You take me higher, the place where angels fear to tread<br>
<br>
<br>
And I will run<br>
Oh and I won't quit<br>
Chasing Your heart<br>
Just like David did<br>
I'll come running through the gates<br>
Look into Your face, oh I can hardly wait<br>
Until You carry my soul, carry my soul away<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh<br>
<br>
<br>
I will run<br>
Oh and I won't quit<br>
Chasing Your heart<br>
Just like David did<br>
I'll come running through the gates<br>
Look into Your face, oh I can hardly wait<br>
Until You carry my soul, carry my soul away<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh<br>
<br>
<br>
When everything is said and done<br>
And death has met its end<br>
I want to hear You call me son, be counted as a faithful friend<br>
<br>
I want to see You rise like fire<br>
I want to see the scars that bled<br>
Oh won't You take me higher, the place where angels fear to tread<br>
<br>
<br>
And I will run<br>
Lord and I won't quit<br>
Chasing Your heart<br>
Just like David did<br>
And I'll come running through the gates<br>
Look into Your face, oh I can hardly wait<br>
Until You carry my soul, carry my soul away<br>
<br>
<br>
And I will keep my lamplight burning in the night<br>
I'll be waiting here for You<br>
Watching for all Your signs<br>
If I may be so bold to ask You<br>
Would You lend Your ear to me?<br>
Oh Lord come quickly<br>
<br>
Oh, oh<br>
<br>
And I will run<br>
Lord and I won't quit<br>
Chasing Your heart<br>
Just like David did<br>
And I'll come running through the gates<br>
Look into Your face<br>
Oh I can hardly wait<br>
Until You carry my soul<br>
Carry my soul away<br>
Until You carry my soul<br>
Carry my soul away<br>
<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Carry my soul<br>
Oh, oh<br>
Carry my soul<br>
Oh, oh<br>

"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:40 (KJV)<br>
For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:40 (NLT)<br>
For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.<br>
<br>
Yonah is the Hebrew name for 'Jonah.'<br>
Matthew 12:40 (TS2009)<br>
"For as Yonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish, so shall the Son of Ah-Dawm (Son of Adam, Son of Man) be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<br>

Yonah is the Hebrew name for 'Jonah.'<br>
Matthew 12:40 -- Hebrew New Testament to English Translation<br>
For just like Yonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights,<br>
so will the Son of the virgin be in the heart of the earth, (inside the earth)<br>
three days and three nights.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Matthew 12:40 is something that we looked at when we did a random, little study in Christian Essays 12.<br>
We also mentioned it in the study, titled, Old Covenant, New Covenant, which was in Christian Essays 21.<br>
For many centuries, no one could access the original Hebrew New Testament.<br>
We did not even start to have access to any kind of Hebrew New Testament to English Translation until 2021.<br>
That's why all Bible studies before 2021 will say that the New Testament was originally written in Greek, because no one knew of the Greek New Testament actually being a translation, being translated from Hebrew New Testament books.<br>
That's why, in John 20:16, Mary Magdalene, when she recognises the voice of Jesus, as she is looking down, crying, in the NLT, Jesus calls her name...<br>
"Mary!" Jesus said.<br>
She turned to him and cried out, "Rabboni!" (which is Hebrew for "Teacher").<br>
Why do the English translations have to tell us that she used a Hebrew word?  Why is it important for them to tell us that?<br>
They are supposed to be English translations, so why don't they just give it to us in English and just say, Teacher?<br>
They have to tell us that, because, that is what John wrote in the Book of John.<br>
John goes out of his way to let us know that she used a Hebrew word.  John tells us this, and so, the English Bibles are required to tell us this because John wrote down those words in the book of John.<br>
Maybe, that little extra bit of Hebrew information in John 20:16 is because they were all speaking the Hebrew language, and that would suggest that the New Testament books were originally written in Hebrew!<br>
All we had, up until 2021, and all the KJV translation team had access to back in the 1600s, was a Greek translation.<br>
Since we did not know it was a translation, we thought all this time that the New Testament was originally written in Greek.<br>
<br>
Every time a translation is made, there is usually a degradation of wording and meaning precision, which is why we have the expression, it got Lost in the translation.<br>
We had to use a Greek translation that contained mistakes and changes, some accidental, and some done on purpose.<br>
Why do the names in the Greek New Testament all have different spellings and pronunciations?<br>
Maybe someone does not want you to know what the real names are!<br>
If we are to call upon his name, but are then told the wrong name, how can we truly connect when we call out the wrong name?<br>
I call upon his name, but I don't see any results.  Maybe, someone gave me the wrong name on purpose!<br>
If I am to telephone you, but I am given the wrong telephone number, how can we truly connect when I can only dial a wrong number?<br>
I call your phone number, but you never answer.  Maybe, someone gave me the wrong phone number on purpose!<br>
<br>
Here is the comment I mainly said when we looked at Matthew 12:40 in Christian Essays 12...<br>
If they would have had the original Hebrew New Testament, they would have clearly known that it was a fish.<br>
As we said in Christian Essays 12, the Hebrew language has two totally different words for fish and whale.<br>
When the Hebrew word was translated in the Greek translation, they chose a generic Greek word that does not specifically identify a fish.<br>
Greek language experts may be able to explain why this happened.<br>
The Greek word used there refers to a generic, large sea creature of no specific kind, so it is a Greek word that could be talking about any large sea creature, fish or mammal.<br>
Maybe it would have been confusing because fish these days are normally small, and not big enough to swallow up a man whole.<br>
The Bible describes many sea creatures that are now extinct.<br>
They ended up using the Greek word, Kah-Paw-Toes, which can refer to a whale, but it mainly means, huge fish, or sea-monster.<br>
Whomever was on the team for translating the Greek translation into the KJV English decided to translate the Greek word, Kah-Paw-Toes, into the English word, whale, and apparently did not bother to look at the Old Testament Hebrew word used in Jonah's story.<br>
Getting their hands on and reading the Bible in English was not possible for most people, let alone the large number of the general population that could not even read or write English at all.<br>
That is why stained-glass windows in churches were used to communicate Bible stories, because most people could not read, and did not own an English Bible even if they could read.<br>
That's why they made a KJV English Bible translation, so that more people could understand the Bible in English.<br>
So, it's understandable if the KJV translator had never read the story of Jonah in English, because, in the 17th Century, it was very rare and hard to find the English translation, let alone someone who knew how to read English or Hebrew.<br>
Jesus is talking about the story of Jonah, but the KJV translator, not able to access or study or fact-check with the book of Jonah, was just doing his job, translating Greek into English, and not really thinking about the meaning behind the message.<br>
<br>
How many other verses in our English Bible translations are technically inaccurate or wrong? By accident or on purpose?<br>
There are many, many others, and we have studied several of them before, in many previous Bible studies.<br>
Don't let those little name or word inaccuracies stop you from taking in the Word of Yaw, studying the Word of Yaw, or sharing the Word of Yaw with others, even if you don't have your favourite English Bible translation handy.<br>
<br>
May our knowledge and learning of these word and name translation mistakes help us get closer to Him, and know him even better and more clearly, with better and deeper understanding. Ah-Main!<br>

Matthew 16: 13-17 -- KJV<br>
16:13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?<br>
16:14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.<br>
16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<br>
16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.<br>
16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.<br>
<br>
"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.<br>
<br>
Matthew 16: 13-17 -- NLT<br>
13 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"<br>
14 "Well," they replied, "some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say Jeremiah or one of the other prophets."<br>
15 Then he asked them, "But who do you say I am?"<br>
16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."<br>
17 Jesus replied, "You are blessed, (Simon bar-Jonah) Simon son of John, because my Father in heaven has revealed this to you. You did not learn this from any human being.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In verse 16, where Peter says, You are the Messiah,<br>
Messiah is the Hebrew word for Christ.<br>
The Hebrew word, Messiah, which is actually pronounced, Muh-Shee-Uck,<br>
and the Greek word, Christ, both mean "anointed one."<br>
Peter is saying, You are the anointed one.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 16: 13-17 -- TS2009<br>
13 Now when Yaw-Who-Shaw came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His taught ones, saying, "Who do men say the Son of Ah-Dome is?"<br>
14 And they said, "Some say John the Immerser, and others Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."<br>
15 He said to them, "And you, who do you say I am?"<br>
16 And Simon Peter answering, said, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living ELL-Low-Heem."<br>
17 And Yaw-Who-Shaw answering, said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon bar-Yonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father in the heavens.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Test question. Jesus Christ. In Hebrew, that name is Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>
Who do you say He is?<br>
This is a test. When your body dies, your test gets turned in, and your answer becomes final.<br>
Then you will know what the correct answer is, but you will not be able to change the answer that you wrote down.<br>
If the teacher sees that the answer was left blank, do you think the teacher will mark it as correct?<br>
If you wrote down no answer at all, or if you wrote down the wrong answer, you can still change your answer.<br>
But change it, and make sure it is correct, before it is too late.<br>
It is an Open Book test. Open the book, read the book, and study the book, and get the answer correct.<br>
We just now read the answer to this test question, there in Matthew 16.<br>
<br>
Let's say you are taking a test, and the test question is,<br>
What is two plus two?<br>
And so, you decide to write this down as the answer.<br>
<br>
I think that two plus two is, whatever you want it to be.<br>
If you think that two plus two is five, or if you think that, two plus two is thirty-three, or if you think that two plus two is one hundred and forty-four thousand, well then, good for you!<br>
You have found YOUR answer to what YOU think two plus two is!<br>
<br>
If I was to write that down as the answer, do you think the teacher would mark my answer as correct, or incorrect?<br>
<br>
Who do you say He is?<br>
You can give any answer you wish, but some answers are wrong. All answers are wrong, except for one, and only one.<br>
There is no other name, and there is no other way.<br>
Get your answer right. It's an Open Book test. Be prepared now to give your answer. Be ready!<br>
You never know when the teacher says, Time's up! -- and, finished or not, ready or not, your test will suddenly get turned in.<br>
<br>

Using Vocals and turntables, Michael Joseph Allen has been making Christian hip hop music since 1997.<br>
Michael Joseph Allen is professionally known as DJ Maj.<br>
His name, DJ Maj, is spelled like this, D, J, space, M, A, J.<br>
DJ Maj is a Christian music DJ and rapper, contributing to gospel music albums released by tobyMac, GRITS, Ill Harmonics, Carman, dc Talk, and the Newsboys.<br>
DJ Maj has released four mixtapes, as well as four solo albums.<br>
His friends gave him the name "DJ Magic" after watching him play on turntables.<br>
He later changed his name to "DJ Maj" to reflect that, as a Christian, he did not want to be associated with magic.<br>
It was wise for him to do that, for we just read two verses earlier that tell us that it is a sin to practice magical arts.<br>
<br>
In 2003, Gotee Records released a mixtape from DJ Maj, titled, The Ringleader: Mixtape Volume III.<br>
From that mix is a rap song that had some interesting lyrics to it.<br>
It's the first rap song presented in the mix, and it's called, The Ringleader.<br>
<br>
There was an unsegued version of the song that was played for a time in 2004,<br>
on the Cross Rhythms Christian radio network in Stoke-on-Trent, England,<br>
which is about 170 miles north-west of London,<br>
or about 53 miles south of Manchester.<br>
<br>
<br>
From his Christian hip hop album, The Ringleader Mixtape Volume III,<br>
here are the words from his 2003 song, The Ringleader, by DJ Maj...<br>

To hear Him and See Him<br>
But it's also disappointing<br>
that everybody is not allowed<br>
to listen, to hear and see<br>
This dynamic individual<br>
<br>
These are the sounds of days that are past<br>
A voice can cut through the hazy fog of time<br>
and bring yesterday's images sharply into focus.<br>

Numbers 21: 4-10 (KJV)<br>
21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.<br>
(and the soul of the people was much shortened because of the way.)<br>
(and the soul of the people was much grieved because of the way.)<br>
21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.<br>
21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.<br>
21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.<br>
21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.<br>
21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.<br>
21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 21: 4-10 (NLT)<br>
4 Then the people of Israel set out from Mount Hor,<br>
(taking the road to the sea of reeds to go around the land of Edom.<br>
taking the road to the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom. But the people grew impatient with the long journey,<br>
5 and they began to speak against God and Moses. "Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die here in the wilderness?" they complained. "There is nothing to eat here and nothing to drink. And we hate this horrible manna!"<br>
6 So the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the people, and many were bitten and died.<br>
7 Then the people came to Moses and cried out, "We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take away the snakes." So Moses prayed for the people.<br>
8 Then the Lord told him, "Make a replica of a poisonous snake and attach it to a pole. All who are bitten will live if they simply look at it!"<br>
9 So Moses made a snake out of bronze and attached it to a pole. Then anyone who was bitten by a snake could look at the bronze snake and be healed!<br>
10 The Israelites travelled next to Oboth and camped there.<br>

3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.<br>
<br>
Son of Man is a title Jesus used for himself.<br>
<br>
John 3: 6-17 (NLT)<br>
...the Holy Spirit gives birth to spiritual life.<br>
(What is born of the Spirit is spirit.)<br>
7 So don't be surprised when I say, 'You (all) must be born again.'<br>
8 The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can't tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can't explain how people are born of the Spirit."<br>
9 "How are these things possible?" Nicodemus asked.<br>
10 Jesus replied, "You are a respected Jewish teacher, and yet you don't understand these things?<br>
11 I assure you, we tell you what we know and have seen, and yet you won't believe our testimony.<br>
12 But if you don't believe me when I tell you about earthly things, how can you possibly believe if I tell you about heavenly things?<br>
13 No one has ever gone to heaven and returned. But the Son of Man (who lives in heaven) has come down from heaven.<br>
14 And as Moses lifted up the bronze snake on a pole in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,<br>
15 so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.<br>
16 "For this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.<br>
17 God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him.<br>

20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<br>
20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:<br>

We looked at a small part of 2 Kings 17 when we did our Bible study, titled,<br>
Surefooted Or A Stumbling-Block<br>
which was in Christian Essays 20, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 20.<br>
Let's look at that area again, and keep on reading into the next chapter.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 17: 32-41, the last 10 verses of chapter 17, starting at verse 32 and we keep on reading into the next chapter, stopping at verse 8.<br>
2 Kings 17:32 reading until we get to 2 Kings 18:8 -- KJV<br>
17:32 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.<br>
17:33 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.<br>
(They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations who carried them ways from thence.)<br>
<br>
17:34 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;<br>
17:35 With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:<br>
17:36 But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.<br>
17:37 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.<br>
17:38 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.<br>
17:39 But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.<br>
17:40 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.<br>
17:41 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.<br>
18:1 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.<br>
18:2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.<br>
18:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.<br>
(He removed the high places, and brake the statues)<br>
18:4 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.<br>
18:5 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.<br>
(For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from after him)<br>
18:6 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.<br>
18:7 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.<br>
18:8 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 17: starting at verse 32 and we keep on reading into the next chapter, stopping at verse 8.<br>
2 Kings 17:32 reading until we get to 2 Kings 18:8 -- NLT<br>
32 These new residents worshiped the Lord, but they also appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests to offer sacrifices at their places of worship.<br>
33 And though they worshiped the Lord, they continued to follow their own gods according to the religious customs of the nations from which they came.<br>
34 And this is still going on today. They continue to follow their former practices instead of truly worshiping the Lord and obeying the decrees, regulations, instructions, and commands he gave the descendants of Jacob, whose name he changed to Israel.<br>
35 For the Lord had made a covenant with the descendants of Jacob and commanded them: "Do not worship any other gods or bow before them or serve them or offer sacrifices to them.<br>
36 But worship only the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt with great strength and a powerful arm. Bow down to him alone, and offer sacrifices only to him.<br>
37 Be careful at all times to obey the decrees, regulations, instructions, and commands that he wrote for you. You must not worship other gods.<br>
38 Do not forget the covenant I made with you, and do not worship other gods.<br>
39 You must worship only the Lord your God. He is the one who will rescue you from all your enemies."<br>
40 But the people would not listen and continued to follow their former practices.<br>
41 So whilst these new residents worshiped the Lord, they also worshiped their idols. And to this day their descendants do the same.<br>
1 Hezekiah son of Ahaz began to rule over Judah in the third year of King Hoshea's reign in Israel.<br>
2 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years.<br>
(His mother was Abi,)<br>
His mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.<br>
3 He did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight, just as his ancestor David had done.<br>
4 He removed the pagan shrines, smashed the sacred pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke up the bronze serpent that Moses had made, because the people of Israel had been offering sacrifices to it.<br>
The bronze serpent was called Nehushtan.<br>
(Nehushtan sounds like the Hebrew terms that mean, snake, bronze, and, unclean thing.)<br>
5 Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before or after his time.<br>
6 He remained faithful to the Lord in everything, and he carefully obeyed all the commands the Lord had given Moses.<br>
7 So the Lord was with him, and Hezekiah was successful in everything he did. He revolted against the king of Assyria and refused to pay him tribute.<br>
8 He also conquered the Philistines as far distant as Gaza and its territory, from their smallest outpost to their largest walled city.<br>
<br>
Looking again at verse 35...<br>
2 Kings 17:35 (NLT)<br>
For the Lord had made a covenant with the descendants of Jacob and commanded them: "Do not worship any other gods or bow before them or serve them or offer sacrifices to them.<br>
<br>
Do not worship any other gods or bow before them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The comments being shared right here have been shared at least two times before.<br>
Let's think about these comments again.<br>
Do not worship any other gods or bow before them.<br>
Christmas and the Christmas tree is described in the Bible.<br>
Getting it, propping it up so it does not tip over, and decorating it is all described in the Bible.<br>
The Bible teaches us not to do it, at all.<br>
The Bible directly describes the Christmas Tree, and then teaches us not to do Christmas.<br>
We looked at that when we did our Bible Study, titled, Christmas, in Christian Essays 4.<br>
It's still right there in Jeremiah 10: 1-5.<br>
It's been sitting right there all of these centuries, and yet who is reading their entire Bible from cover to cover and trying to actually do what it says?<br>
Some of the verses in there, in Jeremiah 10: 1-5, in the KJV and in the NLT, tell us this.<br>
It describes Christmas as futile and foolish.<br>
Learn not the way of the heathen.<br>
As for the customs of Christmas, it says in Verse 3, The customs of the people are vain.<br>
KJV and NLT say this in verse 5, as for the people that do these heathen holidays, like, Christmas, Easter, Halloween, etc.<br>
Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.<br>
Do not be afraid of such gods, for they can neither harm you nor do you any good.<br>
If these things will not do you any good, then, why waste your time and money doing them?<br>
For the customs of the people are vain, futile and foolish.<br>
<br>
Do not worship any other gods or bow before them.<br>
When you go to get your Christmas present, you bow down before the Christmas Tree.<br>
Do you know the history and the origin of Martial Arts?<br>
Do the motions, movements and gestures in Martial Arts worship the Lord, or someone else?<br>
Martial Arts did not come from the Lord.<br>
If it did not come from the Lord, then, guess who it was that brought it in?<br>
If you do not worship Martial Arts, then watch the students when they walk into and out of the classroom.<br>
What do they do? What are they all told to do? They bow down to the classroom!<br>
Is it a class room or is the room actually a shrine? Do your research!<br>
Are they all wearing uniforms, or are those death robes? Do your research!<br>
What about Yoga?  Do you know the history and origin of Yoga and where it came from?<br>
Yoga did not come from the Lord.<br>
If it did not come from the Lord, then, guess who it was that brought it in?<br>
The motions, movements and gestures in Yoga are all satanic.<br>
Learn not the way of the heathen.<br>
What nation did Yoga come from?  What nation did Martial Arts come from?<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 17:33 (NLT)<br>
And though they worshiped the Lord, they continued to follow their own gods according to the religious customs of the nations from which they came.<br>
<br>
Zephaniah 1:9 (NLT)<br>
Yes, I will punish those who participate in pagan worship ceremonies, and those who fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.<br>
<br>
It sounds generally like a good idea to know how to protect yourself and defend yourself.<br>
Does the Bible encourage us to practise Martial Arts?<br>
No. He hates those who love violence.<br>
<br>
Psalms 11:5 (NLT)<br>
The Lord examines both the righteous and the wicked. He hates those who love violence.<br>
<br>
Violence was one of the things that caused Noah and the Great Flood to be necessary...<br>
<br>
Genesis 6:11 (NLT)<br>
Now God saw that the earth had become corrupt and was filled with violence.<br>
<br>
Psalms 55:9 (NLT)<br>
Confuse them, Lord, and frustrate their plans, for I see violence and conflict in the city.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 22:49 (NLT)<br>
...You hold me safe beyond the reach of my enemies; you save me from violent opponents.<br>
<br>
Psalms 18:48 (NLT)<br>
...You hold me safe beyond the reach of my enemies; you save me from violent opponents.<br>
<br>
Psalms 72:14 (NLT)<br>
He will redeem them from oppression and violence, for their lives are precious to him.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 3:3 (NLT)<br>
He must not be a heavy drinker or be violent. He must be gentle, not quarrelsome, and not love money.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3:31 (NLT)<br>
Don't envy violent people or copy their ways.<br>
<br>
Psalms 140:1 (NLT)<br>
O Lord, rescue me from evil people. Protect me from those who are violent,<br>
<br>
Psalms 140:11 (NLT)<br>
Don't let liars prosper here in our land. Cause great disasters to fall on the violent.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:25 (NLT)<br>
Greed causes fighting; trusting the Lord leads to prosperity.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 15:18 (NLT)<br>
A hot-tempered person starts fights; a cool-tempered person stops them.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 26:21 (NLT)<br>
A quarrelsome person starts fights as easily as hot embers light charcoal or fire lights wood.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 29:22 (NLT)<br>
An angry person starts fights; a hot-tempered person commits all kinds of sin.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2:23 (NLT)<br>
Again I say, don't get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights.<br>
<br>
Psalms 12:5 (NLT)<br>
The Lord replies, "I have seen violence done to the helpless, and I have heard the groans of the poor. Now I will rise up to rescue them, as they have longed for me to do."<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
They feared the LORD, and served their own gods.<br>
And though they worshiped the Lord, they continued to follow their own gods.<br>
Do you have more than one god?  Do you have more than one Lord?<br>
Lord, means, Master.<br>
Do you have more than one Master?<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:24 (NLT)<br>
"No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money.<br>
<br>
(Romans) 10:9 (TS2009)<br>
That if you confess with your mouth the Master Yaw-Who-Shaw and believe in your heart that ELL-Low-Heem has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 45:11 (TS2009)<br>
And let the Sovereign delight in your loveliness; Because He is your Master -- bow yourself to Him.<br>
<br>
(Acts) 10:36 (TS2009)<br>
"He sent the word to the children of Israel (He sent the word to the children of Yis-Rye-ELL), bringing the Good News: peace through Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah! He is Master of all.<br>
<br>
In John 19:30, in the Hebrew to English translation, when Jesus, Yeshua, hung on the cross and had tasted the vinegar, he said, in Hebrew, "It is completed and ended!"<br>
In our Greek translations...He said, It is finished: and he bowed his head... John 19:30 (KJV)<br>
<br>
The Greek word that was translated into, finished, is pronounced, Teh-LAY-Oh.<br>
It means...I pay.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2:9 (NLT)<br>
...you are a chosen people. You are royal priests, a holy nation, God's very own possession. As a result, you can show others the goodness of God, for he called you out of the darkness into his wonderful light.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2:9 (KJV)<br>
But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; (a purchased people;) that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:<br>
(that ye should shew forth the virtues of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:)<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 6:20 (NLT)<br>
for God bought you with a high price....<br>
<br>
Commentary: Grabbing some words from those last two verses, we can say, you are a purchased people, for God bought you with a high price.<br>
He paid the ultimate price on the cross, so that, when he calls us home, we can be with him, forever.<br>
<br>
(Revelation) 17:14 (TS2009)<br>
"They shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for He is Master of masters and Sovereign of sovereigns. And those with Him, are called, and chosen, and trustworthy."<br>
<br>
Revelation 17:14 (NLT)<br>
Together they will go to war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will defeat them because he is Lord of all lords and King of all kings. And his called, and chosen, and faithful ones, will be with him."<br>

The most ancient Greek manuscripts do not include John 7:5 - John 8:11.<br>

Apparently there were several mistakes in the NLT first edition.<br>
Thankfully, they were honest about it, made corrections and improvements, and<br>
by the time we get to the NLT fifth edition, the note changes to now say this:<br>

Translated by the Van Rensburg family<br>
Version 1.1 -- April 2021<br>
A literal translation of a medieval Hebrew manuscript in the Vatican Library.<br>
<br>
<br>
Whilst we are in this New Testament Hebrew to English Translation for the book of John,<br>
there were a few verses in the book of John that are not in here.<br>
That would suggest that the missing verses were added later on by some translator or translation team.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 7: verses 35 and 36 do not exist in this New Testament Hebrew manuscript.<br>
John 7: verses 35 and 36 -- KJV<br>
7:35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles (the Greeks), and teach the Gentiles?<br>
7:36 What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?<br>
<br>
<br>
John 7: verses 35 and 36 -- NLT<br>
35 The Jewish leaders were puzzled by this statement. "Where is he planning to go?" they asked.<br>
"Is he thinking of leaving the country and going to the Jews in other lands?<br>
("Is he thinking of leaving the country and going to the Jews who live among the Greeks?)<br>
Maybe he will even teach the Greeks!<br>
36 What does he mean when he says, 'You will search for me but not find me,' and 'You cannot go where I am going'?"<br>
<br>
<br>
John 19: verse 33 does not exist in this New Testament Hebrew manuscript.<br>
John 19: verse 33 -- KJV<br>
19:33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:<br>
<br>
John 19: 31-33 NLT<br>
...So they asked Pilate to hasten their deaths by ordering that their legs be broken. Then their bodies could be taken down.<br>
32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men crucified with Jesus.<br>
33 But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, so they didn't break his legs.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Blood is made in the bones.  Because none of his bones were broken, all of his bones could make blood.<br>
His body would have no trouble making enough blood because none of his bones were broken.<br>
We can boldly enter heaven's Most Holy Place because the blood of Jesus is sufficient for you and for me, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.<br>
Because none of his bones were broken, this also fulfilled prophecy in the following three verses...<br>
<br>
Exodus 12:46 (NLT)<br>
Each Passover lamb must be eaten in one house. Do not carry any of its meat outside, and do not break any of its bones.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 9:12 (NLT)<br>
They must not leave any of the lamb until the next morning, and they must not break any of its bones. They must follow all the normal regulations concerning the Passover.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34:20 (NLT)<br>
For the Lord protects the bones of the righteous; not one of them is broken!<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Although we might mainly say the name of Jesus as Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
in this translation that we are about to read, Yaw-Who-Shaw is identified as Yeshua, which they say is the Hebrew name for 'Jesus.'<br>
'Yeshua' is short for 'Yehoshua,' which means 'Yah is Salvation.'<br>
<br>
The Lord, the Heavenly Father, which we usually pronounce as, Yaw-Who-Wah,<br>
In this translation, they pronounce the Heavenly Father's name as Yaw-Wea.<br>
It sounds like the 'Wea' sound in the word, weather. Yaw-Wea.<br>
The New Testament Hebrew to English Translation team says, The Hebrew manuscript has "Ha-Shem," which literally means "The Name." <br>
Still today many Jews will read 'Ha-Shem' when they see the Hebrew Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
We have replaced "Ha-Shem" with transliterated consonants of 'the Name' itself: YHWH.<br>
As for pronunciation, the New Testament Hebrew to English Translation team says that the only grammatically possible pronunciation, from which all other abbreviations or contractions can be formed, is 'Yah-weh.'<br>
They say, it's not, Yaw-Way, it's Yaw-Wea, as in Yaw-Weather.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Adon is pronounced, Aw-Dawm, and is the Hebrew way of saying, Adam.<br>
Jesus called himself the son of Adam or the Son of Man.<br>
Adon is the Standard Hebrew word for 'Master.'<br>
'Adon' or 'Ha-Adon' is often used for the Lord, Master, Yaw-Who-Wah, also known as YHWH in quotes from the Old Testament.)<br>
So, Aw-Dawm, means, master, but it is technically the Hebrew way of saying, Adam.<br>

John 7:53 to John 8:11 -- New Testament Hebrew to English Translation<br>
<br>
53 Then every single man returned to his house;<br>
1 and Yeshua went to the Mount of Olives.<br>
2 And the next day in the morning he came into the Sanctuary again. So all the people came unto him, and he sat and taught them.<br>
3 Then the scribes and the Perushim (the Pharisees) brought a woman to him, whom they caught in adultery,<br>
4 and said to him, "This woman was caught in adultery.<br>
5 Now the law of Mosheh (the law of Moses) commands us that she should be judged by stoning. But what do you say about this?"<br>
6 (Now they were tempting him in order to take counsel against him.) So Yeshua bowed down, and wrote something on the ground with his finger.<br>
7 But when they continued asking him, he stood up and said to them, "Let him who is found without sin among you, cast the first stone on her."<br>
8 Then he kneeled again and wrote something on the ground.<br>
9 So when they heard this, they all departed from that place -- one after another -- starting with the leaders; and in the meanwhile Yeshua was left alone.<br>
10 Then Yeshua stood up and said unto the woman, "Where are they who bore witness against you -- did no man punish you?"<br>
11 So she, she answered, "Aw-Dawm, (Master,) here no stone was thrown after me." Then Yeshua said to her, "Neither will I punish you; go and stop sinning -- from now and onward!"<br>
(Then Yeshua said to her, "Neither will I punish you; Stop sinning immediately, from now and onward!)<br>
<br>
Commentary from the Translation team about verse 11:<br>
The Hebrew uses an introductory imperative "Go!"<br>
This is not to be understood literally, but is rather an idiom that adds emphasis on how urgent the command is.<br>
This idiom occurs many times in the Old Testament, and is usually translated as 'immediately' or 'right now.'<br>
It is unlikely that Yeshua Mashiach (Jesus Christ) would send this woman away; she would probably have stayed with Yeshua to learn from him.<br>
So what this phrase really means is: "Stop sinning immediately, from now and onward!"<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, the Hebrew term for the Old Testament is, Tanach.<br>
'Tanach' is a Hebrew acronym for 'Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim,' or in English, 'The Law, the Prophets, the Writings.'<br>
In other words, it refers to the entire so-called 'Old Testament.'<br>
<br>
<br>
John 8:9 (KJV)<br>
And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 8:9 (NLT)<br>
When the accusers heard this, they slipped away one by one, beginning with the oldest, until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman.<br>
<br>
John 8:9 -- New Testament Hebrew to English Translation<br>
So when they heard this, they all departed from that place -- one after another -- starting with the leaders; and in the meanwhile Yeshua was left alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT says he wrote in the dust.<br>
KJV and New Testament Hebrew to English Translation both say that he wrote in the ground.<br>

4:17 For the time is come that judgement must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 4: 16 & 17 NLT<br>
16 But it is no shame to suffer for being a Christian. Praise God for the privilege of being called by his name!<br>
17 For the time has come for judgement, and it must begin with God's household. And if judgement begins with us, what terrible fate awaits those who have never obeyed God's Good News?<br>
<br>
<br>
James 3:1 (KJV)<br>
My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.<br>
<br>
James 3:1 (NLT)<br>
Dear brothers and sisters, not many of you should become teachers in the church, for we who teach will be judged more strictly.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In that story that we looked at earlier in John chapter 8, it said,<br>
Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, bowed down, and wrote something on the ground with his finger.<br>
I have always imagined him writing in the sand, but it says, Ground.  NLT said, dust.<br>
The accusers walked away one after another.  Why?  The Bible does not say what Yaw-Who-Shaw wrote in the ground.<br>
One might imagine or suppose that he may have written some details that referenced each person's sin.<br>
Maybe, if it happened today, one might imagine and say,<br>
he wrote down things that referenced, a website that one guy secretly looked at, a motel name and room number,<br>
the name of some other woman other than his wife, the amount of money received in a bribe, <br>
the fake name used to access something dark in a dark web chat room or on a social media page.<br>
What he wrote down was not recorded and is now forgotten because he remembers our sins no more.<br>
The KJV and the NLT, since they were getting their information from the Greek translation,<br>
they said that they left in order of their age, from older to younger.<br>
The original Hebrew, however, tells us something different.<br>
In the New Testament Hebrew to English Translation, the leaders left first, not the older accusers.<br>
Yes, leaders and elders, would traditionally be older, but he targeted those in leadership first, and not by age.<br>
Judgement must begin at the house of God, and we know that, masters and teachers, those in leadership roles, will be judged more strictly.<br>
We just saw those verses in 1 Peter 4 and in James 3.<br>
The lesson to be learnt would be, don't be going around, judging and criticising someone else's sin,<br>
when you have your own un-dealt with, un-confessed sin that needs to be confessed and cleansed.<br>
You do the confessing, and he will do the cleansing.<br>
<br>
1 John 1:9 (NLT)<br>
But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.<br>
<br>
(1 John) 1:7 (TS2009)<br>
But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Yaw-Who-Shaw Messiah His Son cleanses us from all sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 6:37 (NLT)<br>
"Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, or it will all come back against you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 6:42 (NLT)<br>
How can you think of saying, 'Friend, let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.<br>
<br>
Matthew 7, verses 3, 4 and 5, also tell the same story that we just saw, there in Luke 6, verses 41 and 42.<br>

Psalms 66:18 (KJV)<br>
18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:<br>
NLT:<br>
If I had not confessed the sin in my heart,<br>
the Lord would not have listened.<br>
<br>
Verse 18 indicates, that, if you have sin not confessed, he may not be listening to your prayers.<br>
But look at the surprise in the very next verse, verse 19!<br>

From the study, The Lord Listens, in Christian Essays 7...<br>

Psalms 66: 16-20 NLT<br>
16<br>
Come and listen, all you who fear God,<br>
and I will tell you what he did for me.<br>
17<br>
For I cried out to him for help,<br>
praising him as I spoke.<br>
18<br>
If I had not confessed the sin in my heart,<br>
the Lord would not have listened.<br>
19<br>
But God did listen!<br>
He paid attention to my prayer.<br>
20<br>
Praise God, who did not ignore my prayer<br>
or withdraw his unfailing love from me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 66: 16-20 NASB:<br>
16<br>
Come and hear, (all who revere God) all who fear God,<br>
And I will tell of what He has done for my soul.<br>
17<br>
I cried to Him with my mouth,<br>
And He was extolled with my tongue.<br>
18<br>
If I regard wickedness in my heart,<br>
(If I had regarded wickedness in my heart,)<br>
The Lord will not hear;<br>
19<br>
But certainly God has heard;<br>
He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.<br>
20<br>
Blessed be God,<br>
Who has not turned away my prayer<br>
Nor His lovingkindness from me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Master Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, help us love and forgive others.<br>
Help us not judge others, and help us Stop sinning immediately, from now and onward!<br>
Help us and save us from our own sin, and save us from the sins of others.<br>
We thankfully receive your forgiveness, your mercy and your grace.<br>
In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>

Commentary:<br>
Looking once again at the beginning of Philippians 2, let's especially target what it says in Philippians 2:3.<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:3 (KJV)<br>
Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<br>
<br>
With verse 3 being the targeted verse, let's fly over the verses before and after it.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
We can use verse 3 to answer this question, which is this...<br>
When can a ministry become idolatry?<br>
A ministry can become a form of idolatry if the ministry is being done through strife or vainglory, by being selfish; trying to use the ministry to impress others, if the ministry is being done, and is driven and powered through selfishness or self-conceit.<br>
These are the words used in verse 3 by different English translations.<br>
Let's all try to have the attitude that is being expressed and communicated here...<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 1:27 and we keep reading into chapter 2, stopping at Philippians 2:5 -- KJV<br>
...stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;<br>
1:28 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.<br>
1:29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;<br>
1:30 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.<br>
2:2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.<br>
2:3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<br>
2:4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.<br>
2:5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 1:28 and we keep reading into chapter 2, stopping at Philippians 2:5 -- NLT<br>
28 Don't be intimidated in any way by your enemies. This will be a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed, but that you are going to be saved, even by God himself.<br>
29 For you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ but also the privilege of suffering for him.<br>
30 We are in this struggle together. You have seen my struggle in the past, and you know that I am still in the midst of it.<br>
1 Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ? Any comfort from his love? Any fellowship together in the Spirit? Are your hearts tender and compassionate?<br>
2 Then make me truly happy by agreeing wholeheartedly with each other, loving one another, and working together with one mind and purpose.<br>
3 Don't be selfish; don't try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves.<br>
4 Don't look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.<br>
5 You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 1:27 and we keep reading into chapter 2, stopping at Philippians 2:5 -- TS2009<br>
...stand fast in one spirit, with one being, striving together for the belief of the Good News,<br>
28 without being frightened in any way by those who oppose, which to them truly is a proof of destruction, but to you of deliverance, and that from ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
29 Because to you it has been given as a favour, on behalf of Messiah, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,<br>
30 having the same struggle which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.<br>
1 If, then, there is any encouragement in Messiah, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of Spirit, if any affection and compassion,<br>
2 make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, one in being and of purpose,<br>
3 doing none at all through selfishness or self-conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.<br>
4 Each one should look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.<br>
5 For, let this mind be in you which was also in Messiah Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>

A ram's curved horn is hollow and can be made into a loud horn instrument that can be blown like a bugle trumpet.<br>
A ram's curved horn is known as a shophar in the Hebrew language.<br>
It is pronounced, Show-Far.<br>
The sizes and lengths can typically be one to four feet long, or more.<br>
The word, Shophar, is mentioned 72 times in the Old Testament.<br>
In the KJV, it usually gets translated into the word, trumpet.<br>
We see it mentioned many times in Joshua chapter 6,<br>
and in Judges chapter 7.<br>
There were a few times that this word, shophar, was translated into the English word,<br>
horn, and the word, cornet.<br>
In the New Testament, we see 11 occurrences of a Greek word that was translated into<br>
trumpet or trump.<br>
That would be the Greek word,<br>
Sall-pink.<br>
The New Testament book that mentions a Sall-pink, or trump or trumpet, the most often,<br>
would be the book of Revelation, especially in chapter 8.<br>
<br>
The TS2009 translation decided to keep the Hebrew word, Shophar, as it is.<br>
So, here are a few selected verses from the TS2009 translation<br>
where we can enjoy the Shophar.<br>
Again, a Shophar is a horn, a cornet, a trumpet, made from a ram's curved horn.<br>
<br>
(Nehemiah) 4:18 (TS2009)<br>
As for the builders, each one had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded with the shophar was beside me.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 47:5 (TS2009)<br>
ELL-Low-Heem shall go up with a shout, Yaw-Who-Wah with a voice of a shophar.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 81:3 (TS2009)<br>
Blow a shophar in the New Moon, in the covering for the day of our festival.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 98:6 (TS2009)<br>
With trumpets and a voice of a shophar; Raise a shout before Yaw-Who-Wah, the Sovereign.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 150:3 (TS2009)<br>
Praise Him with the blowing of a shophar; Praise Him with the harp and lyre!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And here is the commandment to blow a trumpet upon the start of the each new month, which is at the beginning of the new moon, upon the sight of the first sliver of new month moonlight...<br>
<br>
Numbers 10:10 (KJV)<br>
Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.<br>
<br>
Numbers 10:10 (NLT)<br>
Blow the trumpets in times of gladness, too, sounding them at your annual festivals and at the beginning of each month. And blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and peace offerings. The trumpets will remind your God of his covenant with you. I am the Lord your God."<br>
<br>
(Numbers) 10:10 (TS2009)<br>
And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed times, and at the beginning of your new moons, you shall blow the trumpets over your ascending offerings and over your slaughterings of peace offerings. And they shall be a remembrance for you before your ELL-Low-Heem. I am Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: It's nice to imagine that, when you blow the shophar,<br>
you are ushering in the ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw and the Sprit that is Holy into that place,<br>
and you are cleaning out the darkness and the evil, unclean spirits out of that place.<br>
It's like, when you blow the shophar, you are saying, ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, Roo-Awk Hawk-Coh-Desh,<br>
Welcome in and fill this place with your spirit, your presence and your glory, your power and your dominion,<br>
and may the ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, Roo-Awk Hawk-Coh-Desh, rebuke and cast out of this place<br>
any amount of satanic darkness and the evil, unclean spirits, and that they be all made to leave and stay away from this place, go to the dry places, and never be allowed to return to here ever again.<br>
In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>

<br>
<br>
Let's look at some verses that we have studied on previous occasions.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 31:8 (NLT)<br>
Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord will personally go ahead of you. He will be with you; he will neither fail you nor abandon you."<br>
<br>
(Hebrews) 13:5 (TS2009)
...be satisfied with what you have. For He Himself has said, "I shall never leave you nor forsake you,"<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:5 (KJV)<br>
Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.<br>
<br>
It sure sounds like Hebrews 13:5 may have been quoting from Deuteronomy 31:8, but it does not quite match up perfectly.<br>
<br>
(Deuteronomy) 31:8 (TS2009)<br>
And it is Yaw-Who-Wah who is going before you, He Himself is with you. He does not fail you nor forsake you. Do not fear nor be discouraged.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 31:8 (KJV)<br>
And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.<br>
<br>
<br>
he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee:<br>
is not exactly the same as<br>
I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.<br>
Will he ever leave us?<br>
Is Hebrews 13:5 trying to quote from Deuteronomy 31:8?<br>
If the Hebrew word that became, fail, could also mean, leave, then maybe, in the Hebrew, it might be a better match than these English translations.<br>
If the book of Hebrews was written in Hebrew, then translated into Greek, then translated into English, maybe it used to match up before all of these translations were made.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 31:8 -- he will not fail thee<br>
The word, fail -- that Hebrew word right there is<br>
Raw-Faw<br>
and, in the Strong's, and in our other usual Old Testament reference books mentioned on several previous occasions,<br>
looking it up, we see that, Raw-Faw, means,<br>
drop, abandon, forsake, let go or let alone, fail, leave.<br>
<br>
So, Hebrews 13:5 could be a valid quote from Deuteronomy 31:8<br>
because the Hebrew word, Raw-Faw, can mean, leave<br>
and the next word, Aw Zav, that became, forsake, that original Hebrew word has a similar kind of meaning...<br>
Aw Zav, means,<br>
to leave, abandon, forsake, neglect,<br>
let loose, set free, let go,<br>
to be forsaken, to be deserted<br>
<br>
So, let's see what it sounds like if we put those definitions into there.<br>
He will not fail thee, neither forsake thee:<br>
He will not Raw-Faw thee, neither Aw Zav thee:<br>
He will not dump you<br>
He will not forsake you<br>
He will not leave you<br>
He will not fail you<br>
He will not let you go<br>
He will not leave you alone<br>
He will not abandon you<br>
He will not desert you<br>
He will not depart from you<br>
He will not leave you behind<br>
He will not drop you<br>
He will not cease.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 14:9 (KJV)<br>
...thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.<br>
<br>
Romans 8:35 KJV<br>
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?<br>
<br>
Romans 8:38 & 39 KJV<br>
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
<br>
Genesis 28:15 KJV<br>
And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.<br>
<br>
Genesis 28:15 (NLT)<br>
What's more, I am with you, and I will protect you wherever you go. One day I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have finished giving you everything I have promised you."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Genesis 28:15 says that He is not going to leave us until he keeps and fulfils and gives us all of His promises.<br>
One of His promises is that he will never leave us.<br>
If He promises that He will never leave us, and He will never leave us until He fulfils all of His promises, and one of those promises is that He will never leave us, then I think it's safe to say that He will never leave us!<br>
It's like a redundant promise stuck in an infinite loop for all of eternity!<br>
I could go on forever about this.  In fact, I will do exactly that, and so can you!<br>
