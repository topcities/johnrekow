</p>
<p>Christian Essays</p>
<p>The Christian Essays are attempts to provide insight, meaning, understanding, interpretation and encouragement from various verses, paragraphs, stories and chapters of the Bible.</p>
<p>The opinions, views and comments in this section are from the website author only. <br />
  The opinions, views and comments are completely separate from, and in no way reflect, the views and opinions of the web host or its sponsors, employees, affiliates or advertisers.<br />
</p>
<p>Bible scriptures are quoted from one of these five English translations:<br />
  King James Version (KJV) (1611)<br />
  New King James Version (NKJV) (1982)<br />
  New International Version (NIV) (1978, with revisions published in 1984 and 2011.)<br />
  New Living Translation (NLT) (1996, with revisions published in 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2015.)<br>
  New American Standard Bible (NASB) (1995)<br />
<br>
<br>
Different people all reading from the NLT may not each see the exact same wording in the NLT, due to the multiple revisions published.<br>
<br>
The NIV was updated in 1984 and 2011.<br>
Some have rejected the NIV 2011 update because of gender-neutral language.<br>
If different people are studying together in the NIV version, they may encounter differences in the wording due to the different NIV editions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even though there is now a 2020 edition of the New American Standard Bible (NASB), when we choose to occasionally quote the NASB, we will be quoting from the previous, 1995 edition, unless we specifically say otherwise.<br>
<br>
<br>
Warning!<br>
Some parts of the Bible contain strong adult content that may not be suitable for young children.<br>
Some people may find Bible studies to be offensive, and those offended people may respond with legal actions (lawsuits) or illegal, criminal actions.<br>
Some governments in some countries may have passed laws that make owning or reading a Bible to be illegal in certain places, and make take actions against those participants, resulting in prison, torture or death.<br>
Some of the content in a Bible study may contain Bible verse readings, quotations, commentaries, details and descriptions that may be considered graphic, sexually-explicit, disturbing or upsetting.<br>
<br>
<br>
All of these Bible studies are generally given the unofficial nickname of, The Bible's Greatest Hits.<br>
Although you can read the Christian Essay pages in whatever order you choose, if you want to basically read them in the regular, default sequence, then you may read them in the following order...<br>
Start with the Parallel Bible, and read straight down to the end.<br>
(The Parallel Bible is unofficially known as chapter zero, with the top 500 Bible verses.)<br>
Next, read Christian Essays 1, which is page 1 or, unofficially, chapter 1.<br>
After you finish Christian Essays 1, go to the Christian Page, and jump down to the Christian Essays that are near the bottom.<br>
The essays on the Christian Page are unofficially referred to as the chapter 1 Bonus Verses.<br>
When you reach the end of the Christian Page, go next to Christian Essays 2, which is also thought of as page 2, or unofficially, chapter 2.<br>
From there you can carry on in the normal numerical sequence, with Christian Essays 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on, all the way to the end.<br>
<br>
Although all of this Bible study content is mainly presented in a random or unpredictable style, you may more likely encounter more advanced topics and Bible studies once you go past Christian Essays 8, also referred to as chapter 8. All of the studies are designed to be easy to learn and understand, for both the new believer, and the more advanced, mature Christian that has already read his or her entire Bible from cover to cover.  The studies will sometimes try to push you past the normal stopping points where most basic, elementary Church services refuse to ascend above in their simple levels of truthful teachings. These studies are not designed to make a church more money and increase their attendance; they are designed to tell you the full truth about topics that churches are too afraid to reveal. If you want to read some true Bible verses that churches would never want you to read, then you've come to the right place.<br>
Keep reading and don't give up, and never stop praying.<br>

Christian Essay:&nbsp; Best Seller<br>
<br>
I recently went to the New York Time's Best Seller List, and near the top of the list was this book:<br>
"The Girl in the Spider's Web", by David Lagercrantz.<br>
<br>
So I bought it and put it on my coffee table.<br>
<br>
The next day, I picked it up, flipped to a random page near the beginning, and read one sentence, then I put it down.<br>
That was a very well-written sentence, I said to myself.<br>
<br>
The next day, I saw it there again on the table, so I picked it up and read about 3 or 4 sentences from some random page somewhere in the middle.<br>
I was thinking, Wow!&nbsp; This author certainly knows how to write a good story!<br>
<br>
The next day, I saw it there again, and I was kind of wondering how the story ended, so I picked a random page near the back of the book and read two whole paragraphs at one time.  That was most of one page!<br>
Wow!&nbsp; That was amazing and exciting!&nbsp; This author sure knows how to write!&nbsp; Maybe I'll read another entire random paragraph tomorrow!<br>
<br>
By now you're probably asking yourself, what's wrong with this guy?&nbsp; That's not how you're supposed to read a book!<br>
You're supposed to start at the beginning and read each page completely all the way to the end! How can you get all that the book has to offer when you only read little bits and pieces, here and there, randomly like that?<br>
<br>
Well, I ask you, what's wrong with me reading a book like that?&nbsp; I mean, after all, isn't that how we all read our Bibles?<br>

Christian Essay & Bible Study:&nbsp; 7 Blank Pages<br>
<br>
I found some amazing lists in the Bible.&nbsp; I know these lists are good and true.<br>
Because, I got all of these lists straight out of the Bible.<br>
These lists are so good, I want you to write them down.<br>
<br>
<br>
Go get seven blank pieces of paper.<br>
<br>
Hold up the first blank piece of paper and look at it.<br>
If you've been thinking about money lately, how to make it and how to spend it, then this list is for you.<br>
The Bible shows us that someday, we will have just as much money as Bill Gates and Donald Trump.<br>
<br>
This first piece of paper is a List of how much money you will have after your body dies.<br>
It's also a list of how much money Bill Gates, Donald Trump and every other rich man will have after their bodies die too.<br>
If you ever wanted to have the same amount of money that they have, someday you will!<br>
And someday, they will have the same amount of money that you have.<br>
<br>
Psalm 49, verses 16, 17 and 10 (KJV)<br>
Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;<br>
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away....<br>
He seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.<br>
<br>
Hold up the second blank piece of paper and look at it.<br>
<br>
This is a list of all of the things that are impossible with God.<br>
Luke 1:37 (KJV)<br>
For with God nothing shall be impossible.<br>
<br>
Hold up the third blank piece of paper.&nbsp; Look at it.<br>
<br>
This is a list of things that are too hard for God.<br>
Jeremiah 32:27 (KJV)<br>
Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 32:17 (KJV)<br>
Ah Lord God!&nbsp; behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee<br>
<br>
Hold up of the fourth blank piece of paper.&nbsp; Read it carefully.<br>
<br>
This is a list of your Sins that God Actually Remembers.<br>
Jeremiah 31:34 (KJV)<br>
...I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now look at the fifth piece of paper.<br>
If you see your name on this list, then you do not need Jesus.<br>
<br>
Because, this is a list of the People on this Earth right now that are Righteous right now, and have not fallen short of the glory of God.<br>
Romans 3:10 (KJV)<br>
...There is none righteous, no, not one:<br>
<br>
Romans 3:23 (KJV)<br>
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br>
<br>
Now take look at the sixth piece of paper.<br>
<br>
This is a list of All the things you can do without Jesus.<br>
John 15:5 (KJV)<br>
...without me ye can do nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
And now we have the seventh and last piece of paper.<br>
If you wonder if Jesus has any plans to leave you, those dates and times are listed here.<br>
<br>
In other words, this is a list of the Number of Times Jesus will Leave You or Forsake You.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:5 (KJV)<br>
...for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.<br>
Nehemiah 9:17 (KJV)<br>
...thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.<br>
<br>
And if you can't remember which list was on which piece of paper, that's OK.<br>
I got all of those lists straight out of the Bible.&nbsp; That's where you'll find them if you need to see them again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
Oh yeah.&nbsp; I had another list around here somewhere.&nbsp; Where'd it go?&nbsp; It was a list of all those dates and times when you should stop praying.<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:17 (KJV)<br>
KJV: Pray without ceasing.<br>
NLT: Never stop praying. <br>
<br>

<br>
Bible Study:&nbsp; An example of a simple Christian Church Service:<br>
<br>
How many people need to be present to have a church service?<br>
Jesus said,
For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. -- Matthew 18:20 (KJV)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What did the first and original church service look like?<br>
<br>
And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. -- Acts 2:42 (KJV)<br>
<br>
The early church service consisted of four things:<br>
1. "continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine" --- continuing to Read the Bible<br>
2. Fellowship -- Gathering Together, meeting together, being together as a group of people<br>
3. Breaking of bread -- the Lord's Supper -- Communion<br>
4. Praying<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is Acts 2:42 again, from NLT, and if we continue by reading a few more verses after that, we see what happens after the church meeting:<br>
All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, and to fellowship, and to sharing in meals (including the Lord's Supper), and to prayer. A deep sense of awe came over them all, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders. And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had. They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need. They worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the Lord's Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity -- all the while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved.<br>
Acts 2:42-47 (NLT)<br>
<br>
Going to church and doing church was the cause, and all those things that happened afterwards were the results and effects, all caused by first going to church and doing church.<br>
<br>
What does the Bible say about each one of those four things?<br>
<br>
"apostles' doctrine" -- reading the Bible:  (all KJV unless noted otherwise)<br>
2 Timothy 2:15<br>
KJV: Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2:16<br>
But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.<br>
<br>
Psalm 119:18<br>
Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. <br>
<br>
<br>
Psalm 119:105<br>
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:12<br>
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<br>
<br>
NLT of Hebrews 4:12 & 13:<br>
For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires. Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he is the one to whom we are accountable.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4:13  <br>
KJV: Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. <br>
NLT: Until I get there, focus on reading the Scriptures to the church, encouraging the believers, and teaching them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fellowship:<br>
<br>
What is fellowship?<br>
<br>
Here are a few verses in NLT that mention fellowship, but they don't really explain what it is or how to do it.<br>
<br>
1 John 2:28 (NLT)<br>
And now, dear children, remain in fellowship with Christ so that when he returns, you will be full of courage and not shrink back from him in shame.<br>
<br>
1 John 5:20 (NLT)<br>
And we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us understanding so that we can know the true God. And now we live in fellowship with the true God because we live in fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the only true God, and he is eternal life.<br>
<br>
1 John 1:7 (NLT)<br>
But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.<br>
<br>
from a warning about ungodly people:<br>
Jude 1:12 (NLT)<br>
When these people eat with you in your fellowship meals commemorating the Lord’s love, they are like dangerous reefs that can shipwreck you. They are like shameless shepherds who care only for themselves. They are like clouds blowing over the land without giving any rain. They are like trees in autumn that are doubly dead, for they bear no fruit and have been pulled up by the roots.<br>
<br>
from a warning about false teachers:<br>
2 Peter 2:13 (NLT)<br>
Their destruction is their reward for the harm they have done. They love to indulge in evil pleasures in broad daylight. They are a disgrace and a stain among you. They delight in deception even as they eat with you in your fellowship meals.<br>
<br>
In both of these last two passages of Scripture, they talk about fellowship meals. We have here some indications that the early church shared and had meals together.<br>
<br>
<br>
If we look at the original Greek word in Acts 2:42, according to the Strong's Greek Definition of Fellowship,<br>
The original Greek word for fellowship was "koinonia."<br>
koinonia means, fellowship, communion, communication, distribution, contribution, to communicate, <br>
association, community,  joint participation, intercourse, share which one has in anything, participation, intimacy...<br>
a gift jointly contributed, a collection, a contribution.<br>
<br>
koinonia comes from koinonos.<br>
koinonos is a partaker, partner, companion, associate, a sharer in anything, sharing in the worship.<br>
<br>
Here are some dictionary definitions of fellowship:<br>
<br>
The Chambers 21st Century Dictionary describes Fellowship as "friendly companionship."<br>
<br>
The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English says that fellowship is "a feeling of friendship resulting from shared interests or experiences...a group of people who share an interest or belief, especially Christians who have religious ceremonies together."<br>
<br>
<br>
The original Greek writings of the New testament had koinonia mentioned 19 times.<br>
Here are most of those places where koinonia was originally used.<br>
<br>
koinonia was translated as "contribution" in Romans 15:26 (KJV)<br>
But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
it is translated as "fellowship" in 1 Corinthians 1:9 (KJV)<br>
God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
koinonia gets translated into "communion" in 1 Corinthians 10:16 (KJV)<br>
The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
we see it as fellowship again in 2 Corinthians 8:4 (KJV)<br>
Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.<br>
<br>
<br>
In 2 Corinthians 9:13 (KJV) koinonia is translated into the English word, "distribution" (we start reading here in verse 12)<br>
For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;<br>
<br>
<br>
The "liberal distribution" in KJV seems to become "generosity" in NLT:<br>
As a result of your ministry, they will give glory to God. For your generosity to them and to all believers will prove that you are obedient to the Good News of Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
koinonia is called "communion" again in 2 Corinthians 13:14 (KJV)<br>
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 2:9 (KJV) "fellowship"<br>
And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship;<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 1:5 (KJV) "fellowship" (here are verses 3 through 6)<br>
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:1 (KJV) "fellowship"<br>
If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 3:10 (KJV) "fellowship" (here are verses 8 through 10)<br>
I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philemon 1:6 (KJV) where it says, "the communication" of thy faith (shown here with verses 4 through 6)<br>
I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13:16 (KJV) "communicate" (starting here in verse 15)<br>
let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13: 15 & 16 (NLT) <br>
let us offer through Jesus a continual sacrifice of praise to God, proclaiming our allegiance to his name. And don't forget to do good and to share with those in need. These are the sacrifices that please God.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  It's hard to "share with those in need" if those needs are not "communicated."<br>
<br>
koinonia was the original Greek word used in each of the following places where "fellowship" is written...<br>
1 John 1: 3 - 9 (KJV)<br>
That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
<br>
<br>
One thing that we will look at later is how the Bible tells us to go to Church.<br>
The phrase is shown here...<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:25 (KJV)<br>
  Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together...<br>
<br>
Here are the Greek words before they were translated into English:<br>
Not forsaking the episunagoge of heautou episunagoge...<br>
<br>
Notice that "assembling" and "together" were both originally the same Greek word, "episunagoge."<br>
<br>
Strong's says that episunagoge means, "gathering together, assembling together, a gathering together in one place, the (religious) assembly (of Christians)."<br>
<br>
Commentary:  The Bible shows us what the original Christian church service looked like and what it consisted of.  We have four main components that made up the original church service. Fellowship is one of those four key ingredients.  The other three would be Reading the Bible, the Breaking of bread, also known as the Lord's Supper or Communion, and lastly, praying.  The Bible does a good job telling us about the importance and value of reading the Bible, the symbolism and importance of remembering to do Communion, and we have a significant amount of advice, instruction and importance about praying and how to pray.  The one thing that is not so easy to find and extract from the scriptures are instructions and examples of fellowship. Fellowship sounds like Gathering Together, meeting together, and being together as a group of people, but there are two different Greek words, koinonia and episunagoge. If I try to bring all of these words and meanings together, it seems that fellowship is when fellow Christians come together and spend time together, communicating and sharing their needs and what they are going through.  I once heard that when you are going through something, a friend is someone who goes through it with you.  There seems to be an intimate sort of intercourse, and a sharing together.  NLT mentions "fellowship meals." Fellowship does not just happen with fellow Christians.  There also seems to be a sort of fellowship that happens with all of the Christians and Jesus and the Holy Spirit.  What would happen at a fellowship meal?  We all take in the same thing together as one.  The same food all enters into us as though we are all one body.  We have fellowship with each other and also fellowship with Christ and fellowship with the Holy Spirit. It comes back to communion where Jesus wants to enter into you and become one with you as At-One-Ment, or atonement.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 3:20 (KJV)<br>
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.<br>
<br>
Once again, Jesus wants to enter into your home and share a meal with you, which means that whatever is entering into you is also entering into Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Once again, looking at this verse of Revelation 3:20, Jesus wants to enter into your home and share a meal with you, which means that whatever is entering into you is also entering into Him.  It reminds me of fellowship.  It is more than just being together.  It is communicating, connecting and sharing, giving, receiving, making sure every fellow Christian is OK, and that needs are met.  Whatever we are going through, we all go through it together as one body.  At the Fellowship meal, I sup with the fellow Christian and they sup with me, and we all take in and eat the same meal together, just like with Communion.<br>
I have to confess that I can be not-so-great at doing fellowship.  I tend to be shy, and I would rather just sit quietly and keep to myself.  When church service is over, there can be many times when I avoid talking to anyone, and I just make a mad dash for the exit door, being quick to leave.  The Bible does not say that these four components that make up a church service are divided into four equal parts.  They are not, but if they were, then when I avoid communicating and sharing and I just try to leave right after service is over, I am choosing to miss out on 25% of the church service.  Those moments before and after church where people are fellowshipping, those moments are actually part of the church service.  When I avoid all possible fellowshipping, I'm missing out on part of the blessing and benefit of going to church, by as much as 25% or more.  The Bible does not say that one of these four church service components are more or less important than the other three.  That would make me think that they are all equally important. Imagine a church service with not a single Bible verse being mentioned, or imagine a church service where not a single prayer is lifted up.  Sadly, many churches fail to do communion, which we are commanded to do "often," as often as we eat or drink.  My definition of often is not Christmas and Easter only.  I plan to eat and drink more often than that! So, if I go to church, and we do prayer and we read a few Bible verses, but we skip communion and I keep to myself and avoid fellowshipping, then I have missed out on 50% of what a real church service should actually be. In conclusion, do all four of these essential components of what a church service should be as it was originally defined in the book of Acts, and that includes doing communion "often" and fellowshipping before and after the service.  Even if you are a pastor and you need to catch a plane after the service or you need to get to a wedding or funeral, don't make a fast exit out the door, because fellowshipping is part of the church service, and is just as important as praying, reading the bible and doing communion at a church service.  When it comes to my skills and abilities as a Christian, I still need to do a much better job of engaging in fellowship.<br>
<br>
We are looking at the four things that the first and original church did in Acts 2:42.  We have now gone over the first two components of what made up a church service.  The first was reading the Bible.  The second ingredient is fellowship, which we have just looked at.  Next, the third item we have is the breaking of bread, which is communion.<br>
<br>
<br>
breaking of bread:<br>
<br>
Matthew 26:26-30 (KJV)<br>
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;  For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.  But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 14:22-26 (KJV)<br>
And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.  Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11:23-25<br>
NLT: For I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and said, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me." In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant between God and his people—an agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this to remember me as often as you drink it."<br>
KJV: For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. <br>
<br>
Commentary: It says here that Jesus said "this do in remembrance of me."  The "me" is Jesus.  Do communion in remembrance of Jesus and what he did.  If you are thinking of you and what you've done when you are doing communion, then you are not giving communion its proper worth. You don't do communion in remembrance of you, you do it in remembrance of Jesus. It's all about what he did, not what you've done. All is forgiven.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
At His Last Supper, Jesus referred to Himself as Food that you need to eat.<br>
What about His First Supper, as Baby Jesus?<br>
<br>
Luke 2:7 (KJV)<br>
And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger....<br>
<br>
<br>
What is a manger?<br>
 Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English: "a long open container that horses, cattle etc. eat from."<br>
 Chambers 21st Century Dictionary: "an open box or trough from which cattle or horses feed."<br>
<br>
Baby Jesus laid in a container that served food.<br>
Jesus referred to his body as food.  Like good food, Jesus needs to enter into you.<br>
Communion reminds us of that.  After you do communion, ask yourself, where is that bread now?  Where is that wine now?  It is in you. He is in you. Remember that.<br>
When you eat food, the food and you become one.  Jesus is God, so that means Jesus came here so that he, God, could enter into you and become one with you.<br>
Jesus is the food that makes you one with God.<br>
<br>
<br>
We are looking at the four things that the first and original church did in Acts 2:42.<br>
The fourth and final item is that they continued stedfastly in the sending up of prayers.<br>
<br>
prayers:<br>
How often are we supposed to pray?<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:17 (KJV)<br>
KJV: Pray without ceasing.<br>
NLT: Never stop praying. <br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2:8 (KJV)<br>
KJV: I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.<br>
NLT: In every place of worship, I want men to pray with holy hands lifted up to God, free from anger and controversy.<br>
<br>
And that right there is an example of a simple Christian Church Service.<br>
<br>
<br>
And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. -- Acts 2:42 (KJV)<br>

<br>
The Bible tells us many things about praying.<br>
Keep reading, and we will look into prayer some more in just a moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Gospel (this is what makes you a Christian):<br>
<br>
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. -- Romans 10:9 (KJV)<br>
<br>
If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. -- Romans 10: 9 & 10 (NLT)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jesus is with his disciples, and the disciples ask Jesus this question...<br>
<br>
Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. -- John 6: 28 & 29 (KJV)<br>
<br>
John 6: 28 & 29 -- NLT:<br>
They replied, "We want to perform God's works, too. What should we do?"<br>
Jesus told them, "This is the only work God wants from you: Believe in the one he has sent."<br>
<br>
Did you notice that his disciples just happen to use the word, "works" -- worksssss, with an S on the end, as in, more than one?<br>
Jesus only used the word, "work" -- no S on the end -- singular. One.<br>
Commentary:  I think they were expecting Jesus to give them a list of works, but Jesus only had one single work that He wanted them to do.<br>
that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  All the work that needed to be done so that we can go to Heaven, instead of hell, Jesus did that work on the Cross for us.  That is why...<br>
<br>
...He said, It is finished: and he bowed his head... John 19:30 (KJV)<br>
<br>
The Greek word that was translated into, finished, is pronounced, Teh-LAY-Oh.<br>
It means...<br>
to complete, fulfil, accomplish, a fulfilment<br>
I end, accomplish, pay<br>
I end, finish,<br>
I fulfill, accomplish,<br>
I pay.<br>
to end, complete, execute, conclude, to discharge (a debt)<br>
<br>
Commentary: The debt was paid in full. <br>
Since the wages of sin is death, Jesus paid that wage for you, and he paid it in full, because He loves you, to death.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:&nbsp; Looking again at Romans 10:9, according to this verse, the only work you have to do to get into Heaven is to say out loud with your mouth, and believe it is true in your heart that Jesus died on the cross for your sins, that God raised him up from the grave, and that Jesus is Lord, which means that you believe that Jesus Christ and God are one and the same.&nbsp; That's it!&nbsp; Being able to be completely forgiven, saved and knowing for sure that you are going to heaven has nothing to do with you being good enough, working hard enough, following all the rules or obeying all the laws.&nbsp; It's a free gift, not a paycheque.&nbsp; You did not earn it, and you don't deserve it, but you get to be saved and live forever in heaven, not because you are good enough, but because He is good enough.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Look at the second thief that was hanging on a cross next to Jesus:<br>
At first, the second thief is talking to the first thief, then he talks to Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 23, verses 40 through 43, KJV:<br>
...Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?<br>
And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.<br>
And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.<br>
And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
"...Don't you fear God even when you have been sentenced to die?<br>
We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man hasn't done anything wrong."<br>
Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom."<br>
And Jesus replied, "I assure you, today you will be with me in paradise."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, ask yourself this question:&nbsp; What good work did that second thief do to get into heaven?&nbsp; Did he start being a good person?&nbsp; Did he start reading his Bible every day and going to church every Sunday?&nbsp; Did they take him off of the cross, baptize him, then put him back up on the cross so that Jesus could tell him that, later today, he would be in paradise?&nbsp; Now, these are all good things to do.&nbsp; It's good to read your Bible and pray every single day, and to stay plugged into a church (which is what we are told to do in Hebrews 10:25), and the Bible does say in Acts 2:38 to "Repent and be Baptized".&nbsp; And, I'm sure we could list hundreds of "good" things to do.&nbsp; But, what work did this thief "do" to get into heaven (paradise)?&nbsp; In only a short number of hours later after speaking those words to Jesus, he would be dead.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
Only his body would be dead.&nbsp; When you beleive in Jesus and are saved, your earthly body dies, and yet, according to the scriptures, you will not die, but, instead, you will be instantly in heaven, you will be given a new name and a new, perfect body that will stay new and perfect forever.&nbsp; Every bad thing you ever did, said, thought about, imagined in your mind, fantasied about or desired, or clicked on when nobody else was looking, all of those bad mistakes will be instantly and permanently forgiven and forgotten by the Lord.&nbsp; He will wipe away every tear from your eye, and he will take away all of the pain that you have suffered here on this Earth.&nbsp; You will see God face-to-face, you will be "like" God, and you will live forever with Him in His kingdom.&nbsp; That is what it means to be saved.&nbsp; It seems so simple and easy because He did all the work for us on the cross.&nbsp; Just take Romans 10:9, stick it into a prayer, pray it out loud, believe it is true in your heart, and you will be saved.&nbsp; Your salvation does not need to be a question mark.&nbsp; Turn it into an exclamation point.&nbsp; Do what Romans 10:9 says to do.&nbsp; Do it right now if you have not done so already.&nbsp; You'll be glad you did, forever.<br>

<br>
That's one of the most important, life changing prayers you could ever pray.&nbsp; Speaking of prayer, the Bible tells us many amazing things about prayer, and gives us several good examples of what to say in a prayer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
An example of a prayer:<br>
1 Chronicles 4:10 <br>
KJV: And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested. -- 1 Chronicles 4:10 (KJV)<br>
<br>
NLT: He was the one who prayed to the God of Israel, "Oh, that you would bless me and expand my territory! Please be with me in all that I do, and keep me from all trouble and pain!" And God granted him his request. -- 1 Chronicles 4:10 (NLT)<br>
<br>
What happens when you pray?<br>
Daniel 9: 21 - 23<br>
KJV:  Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding. At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved....<br>
NLT:  As I was praying, Gabriel, whom I had seen in the earlier vision, came swiftly to me at the time of the evening sacrifice. He explained to me, "Daniel, I have come here to give you insight and understanding. The moment you began praying, a command was given. And now I am here to tell you what it was, for you are very precious to God. <br>
Again, it says, "The moment you began praying, a command was given."<br>
Imagine that every time you pray, in response to your prayers, up in Heaven, the Lord gives out commands, and orders are issued, actions are taken, and angels are dispatched, all because of your prayer.  Why? Because, "you are very precious to God."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The bible commands us to go to church.<br>
In the Bible, it is called, "the assembling of ourselves together."<br>
When we choose to deliberately avoid going to church, we are disobeying what the Bible says to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:24-25<br>
KJV: And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.<br>
NLT: Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.<br>
<br>
<br>
In other words, go to church.  Keep going. The Bible tells us to.<br>
But there are Christians who choose not to go to church. That's another big topic that we will look at here in just a moment.<br>
<br>
Before we talk more about going and not going to church, let's look at a few more verses that tell us more about praying.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jesus gave us advice and an example of how to pray:<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:5-8 (KJV)<br>
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:9-13 (KJV) commonly known as The Lord's Prayer:<br>
After this manner therefore pray ye: <br>
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<br>
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us this day our daily bread.<br>
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<br>
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
If we keep reading, we see that Jesus talks more about verse 12 where it says, "forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."<br>
Matthew 6:14 & 15 (KJV)<br>
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:<br>
But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:5-15 again in NLT:<br>
"When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell you the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get. But when you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father in private. Then your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.<br>
"When you pray, don't babble on and on as people of other religions do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again. Don't be like them, for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him! Pray like this:<br>
Our Father in heaven,<br>
may your name be kept holy.<br>
May your Kingdom come soon.<br>
May your will be done on earth,<br>
as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us today the food we need,<br>
and forgive us our sins,<br>
as we have forgiven those who sin against us.<br>
And don't let us yield to temptation,<br>
but rescue us from the evil one.<br>
"If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you. But if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is how that prayer is remembered in the book of Luke:<br>
<br>
Luke 11:1-4 (KJV)<br>
And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.<br>
And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.<br>
Give us day by day our daily bread.<br>
And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11:1-4 (NLT)<br>
Once Jesus was in a certain place praying. As he finished, one of his disciples came to him and said, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."<br>
Jesus said, "This is how you should pray:<br>
"Father, may your name be kept holy.<br>
May your Kingdom come soon.<br>
Give us each day the food we need,<br>
and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.<br>
And don't let us yield to temptation."<br>
<br>
From a famous old song (an old hymn) called, "What a Friend we have in Jesus"<br>
 Written by Joseph M. Scriven in 1855:<br>
<br>
"O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear, All because we do not carry Everything to God in prayer."<br>

Commentary: There can be challenges when trying to attend church.  Everyone on the entire planet is not perfect, and if you spend enough time being around someone, anyone great or small, you will eventually see that they are sinners, just like you and me.  They say and do wrong things, and make mistakes.  It does not matter if they are the highest, most respected pastor, or the lowliest, junior assistant janitor, or anyone in between, a volunteer, anyone on staff, or even just an unknown or random person also attending church.  If you spend enough time around them, you will discover that they are merely sinners, like everyone else on the entire planet.  That's why the Bible tells us not to judge others, and that we should not esteem others as being better or worse than us, but instead, we are to love them, pray for them as their weaknesses and imperfections are revealed to us, and to forgive them.  As we just saw in the Lord's Prayer that we need to forgive others and in doing so the Lord will also forgive us.  In summary, don't be surprised when another's shortcomings, limitations and sin are finally revealed to you, and when that moment happens again, love them, forgive them (they don't know what they are doing), don't judge them, and what the Lord has revealed to you about them, keep praying about those things.<br>
<br>
Satan is trying to figure out ways to stop people from going to church.  One of his strategies is to sow discord among the brethren.  The brethren are fellow brothers and sisters attending church, which is an old-fashioned way of referring to all the other people also attending church. Here is the Bible verse that tells us about this:<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 6: 16-19 (KJV)
These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:  A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,  An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 6: 16-19 (NLT)
There are six things the lord hates--<br>
no, seven things he detests:<br>
haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that kill the innocent, a heart that plots evil, feet that race to do wrong, a false witness who pours out lies, a person who sows discord in a family.<br>
<br>
<br>
Strong's Hebrew Definition of Discord is "strife, contention."<br>
<br>
The definition of Discord from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, Advanced Learner's Dictionary is, "disagreement or arguing between people."<br>
The Chambers 21st Century Dictionary says that Discord is, "disagreement; conflict; failure to get on, an uproarious noise. (In music, it is) an unpleasant-sounding combination of notes; lack of harmony."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Some people may be led to start their own church.  Many of the big and famous churches around the world started as a simple Bible study in someone's home, which grew into a small, weekly church service.  For those that decide to start and do their own church service, there can be challenges with that, along with responsibility and accountability to the Lord.  Some people decide to stop attending church because of the discord mentioned earlier, which leads to anger, judging, bitterness and un-forgiveness.  Some people decide that their selfishness and sin are more important than what the Lord says about their sin.  There can be many reasons why some stop or leave Christian church services.  Some people decide that giving value, worth, glory, honour and worship to the Kingdom of Self is more important than giving value, worth, glory, honour and worship to the Kingdom of God. God does not save us so that we can stay exactly the same.  He wants to change us, transform us and make us into new creations.  Some people don't want to change direction.<br>
<br>
Doing one's own church service can have its own challenges.  The Bible does give a clear warning to pastors that misrepresent the Lord and His heart of the matter, and teach things about the Lord that are not true, being in direct opposition to what the Bible says.  If people leave and avoid church due to inaccurate or false teachings, the Lord sees that.  Here is the warning that the Bible gives to pastors:<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 23: 1 & 2 (KJV)<br>
Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the Lord.  Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the Lord.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 23: 1 & 2 (NLT)<br>
"What sorrow awaits the leaders of my people--the shepherds of my sheep--for they have destroyed and scattered the very ones they were expected to care for," says the lord. Therefore, this is what the lord, the God of Israel, says to these shepherds: "Instead of caring for my flock and leading them to safety, you have deserted them and driven them to destruction. Now I will pour out judgment on you for the evil you have done to them."<br>
<br>
Commentary: Shepherds need to have an active relationship and connection with their flock, with knowledge and awareness of how their flock is doing, as indicated in the following verse:<br>
<br>
Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds. Proverbs 27:23 (KJV)<br>
<br>
Know the state of your flocks, and put your heart into caring for your herds.... Proverbs 27:23 (NLT)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  People stop going to church for many, many reasons, some reasons being good and some bad.  Just because someone stops going to church does not mean that it is automatically the pastor's fault.  If the Lord is never changing, and you feel like your heart has moved far away from the Lord, guess who moved?  However, as we just saw there, a moment ago, in Jeremiah 23: 1 & 2, if a pastor is actually to blame for causing someone to now avoid church because they were pushed away from the Lord due to a pastor mis-representing the Lord and what the Bible says, the Lord is very aware of this when it happens, and He will initiate a response and consequence upon "pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep."  Therefore, as I said before, when starting your own, doing your own, and leading your own church services, there will be challenges, responsibility and accountability issues for any and all present and future pastors. Remember to not judge them, but instead, love them, look for ways to help them, and be prepared to forgive them again and again.  Whatever is revealed to you as an imperfection, mistake or other weakness, that exact flaw shown to you is why you should keep praying for him or her.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There could be another reason why more Christians may stop going to church.
<br>
The Bible tells us that, in the end times, the church becomes lukewarm.<br>
<br>
If church does not seem to be as good today as it used to be, the Bible indicates that this may be something that is supposed to happen before Christ's return.<br>

The Seven Phases, Ages and Stages of a Church<br>
And Also the seven kinds of churches that have always been around since the first century.<br>
And Also the seven kinds of churches that you can find today.<br>
And Also, The Seven Stages of Church History<br>
1 of 7. The Loveless Church (Ch. 2, verses 1 to 7)<br>
2 of 7. The Persecuted Church (Ch. 2, verses 8 to 11)<br>
3 of 7. The Compromising Church (Ch. 2, verses 12 to 17)<br>
4 of 7. The Corrupt Church (Ch. 2, verses 18 to 29)<br>
5 of 7. The Dead Church (Ch. 3, verses 1 to 6)<br>
6 of 7. The Faithful Church (Ch. 3, verses 7 to 13)<br>
7 of 7. The Lukewarm Church (Ch. 3, verses 14 to 22)<br>
<br>
Commentary:&nbsp; If this is a historical timeline of Church history, then, perhaps, we could say that Phase 6 of 7, The Faithful Church, was back in the mid-20th Century, with Billy Graham, and the Jesus Movement, which was featured on the cover of Time magazine (it's the red cover briefly shown in the 2015 Christian film, "Woodlawn").<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:&nbsp; Then, if Jesus is to return and the rapture is to happen, then the church would need to become The Lukewarm Church, where the quality of service diminishes, where churches feel like they are filled with fake, disconnected, hypocritical believers that are just going through the motions, doing the same old songs, traditions and rituals, stuck on an endless, repeating loop, pretending to be Christians, feeling unauthentic, un-genuine, with an absence of the holy spirit, and a lack of joy and true love, where fellowship never goes deeper than a polite smile, a handshake and "Good morning."<br>
<br>
Has anyone ever felt like they have recently gone to a Lukewarm Church?&nbsp; If the answer is Yes, then that's a good sign that Jesus will be coming for us soon and that the rapture is about to happen.<br>
<br>
What if the lukewarm church is a sign and indication of Christ's return?&nbsp; If it is, then it needs to happen, and is required to happen, to show that we are moving towards his return, and moving through the book of Revelation, even more into the end times and closer to the tribulation.<br>
<br>
If you want to hear how Jesus describes The Lukewarm Church, here is Revelation, Chapter 3, verses 15 through 22...<br>
<br>
KJV:
And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;<br>
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.<br>
So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.<br>
Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:<br>
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.<br>
As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.<br>
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.<br>
To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.<br>
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
"Write this letter to the angel of the church in Laodicea.&nbsp; This is the message from the one who is the Amen -- the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's new creation:<br>
"I know all the things you do, that you are neither hot nor cold.&nbsp; I wish that you were one or the other! But since you are like lukewarm water, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth!&nbsp; You say, 'I am rich.&nbsp; I have everything I want.&nbsp; I don’t need a thing!'&nbsp; And you don't realise that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.&nbsp; So I advise you to buy gold from me -- gold that has been purified by fire.&nbsp; Then you will be rich.&nbsp; Also buy white garments from me so you will not be shamed by your nakedness, and ointment for your eyes so you will be able to see.&nbsp; I correct and discipline everyone I love.&nbsp; So be diligent and turn from your indifference.<br>
"Look! I stand at the door and knock.&nbsp; If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in, and we will share a meal together as friends.&nbsp; Those who are victorious will sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat with my Father on his throne.<br>
"Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:&nbsp; It is possible that you can find all seven kinds of the above Christian churches today, but if many of the churches give the impression of being lukewarm, and if the quality of the service and the quality of the people in those churches seems to be ungenuine, hypocritical and disappointing, and if seems to be difficult or nearly impossible to find a "good" church, a faithful church, the strong presence of lukewarm churches with lukewarm Christians could all be pointing to the return of Jesus Christ, because, according to this area of scripture, most Christian churches will become lukewarm just before the rapture of the church and Jesus Christ's return.
There are still good churches out there, but they will be difficult to find, and may require a long duration of travel time to get to.
<br>
It could be that, because of the spirit of the lukewarm church, many of the church's quality of service may be perceived by many has being diminished.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Older people that have been Christians for several years may compare the church's Quality of Service (QoS) with other church services from years ago, and may be disappointed because the QoS is not as interesting or entertaining or intellectually or musically stimulating as other church services from other past times and places.<br>
<br>
Ezra 3: 11-13 (KJV)<br>
And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.<br>
But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:<br>
So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezra 3: 10-13 (NLT)<br>
When the builders completed the foundation of the lord's Temple, the priests put on their robes and took their places to blow their trumpets. And the Levites, descendants of Asaph, clashed their cymbals to praise the lord, just as King David had prescribed. With praise and thanks, they sang this song to the Lord:<br>
"He is so good! His faithful love for Israel endures forever!"<br>
Then all the people gave a great shout, praising the lord because the foundation of the lord's Temple had been laid.<br>
But many of the older priests, Levites, and other leaders who had seen the first Temple wept aloud when they saw the new Temple's foundation. The others, however, were shouting for joy. The joyful shouting and weeping mingled together in a loud noise that could be heard far in the distance.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  The older people were sad and disappointed, but the younger people were joyful, because the younger people were not comparing the quality of the current temple with the previous one.  People that have gone to church for many years need to stop judging and comparing a current church service with the memory of another past church service from a past time and place.<br>

This reminds me of a song by Sanctus Real.<br>
The song is titled, "On Fire".<br>
This song was released in October 2014<br>
on Sanctus Real's album, The Dream.<br>
<br>
An interesting remix of "On Fire" is also available<br>
on the following album:<br>
Various Artists - Wow Hits Party Mix Deluxe Edition<br>
which was released in March 2015.<br>
<br>
There is a good chance you can do a YouTube video search for<br>
"Sanctus Real On Fire" and listen to the song right now on YouTube.<br>
<br>
Here are the lyrics to the song, "On Fire" by Sanctus Real:<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember when you couldn't wait<br>
to show up early and find your place.<br>
Cause you didn't want to miss a thing.<br>
And your heart was open and ready for change.<br>
Oh, those days.<br>
You were never afraid to sing,<br>
never afraid to lift your hands.<br>
Didn't care what people would think.<br>
<br>
You were on fire,<br>
and church was more than a place,<br>
and people were more than faces,<br>
and Jesus was more than a name.<br>
<br>
Remember when you weren't ashamed.<br>
To tell your friends about your faith.<br>
A time when you felt the pain<br>
of just one lost soul that was slipping away.<br>
Your heart was soft, you had radiant eyes,<br>
but slowly the pressures and burdens of life<br>
pulled you into the dark of the night.<br>
But when did you lose your sight?<br>
<br>
Cause you were on fire,<br>
and church was more than a place,<br>
and people were more than faces,<br>
and Jesus was more than a name.<br>
<br>
Oh you were on fire,<br>
you let life put out the flame.<br>
But he's still calling out for you<br>
cause he wants to light your heart again.<br>
And set it on fire<br>
Set it on fire.<br>
<br>
Turn your eyes, turn your eyes<br>
and don't forget what it was like<br>
Set me on fire, set me on fire<br>
I wanna hold God's people close<br>
wanna feel the power of Jesus' name<br>
<br>
Set me on fire<br>
Set me on fire<br>
<br>
<br>

Luke 9:62 (KJV)<br>
And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
The windscreen (Americans call it the windshield) on a car is really big, and the rear-view mirror is really small.<br>
Why? Because your focus and attention should mainly be on the things ahead of you, not the things behind you.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Lot was told not to look back as he was moved out of an evil city, but his wife looked back at the evil, perhaps longing for the people, places and moments from her past, the good old days, and in doing so, she turned into someone without life, unable to move or move forward toward the new things that God wanted to do with her and her life, because she could not turn away from her past, from the familiar place where many memories were made, perhaps fond memories, what was familiar to her and where she was from.<br>
The Bible does not actually tell us any of this. The only thing the Bible says is this as they were leaving Sodom and Gomorrah:<br>
<br>
Genesis 19:26 (KJV)<br>
But (Lot's) wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 17:32 (KJV)<br>
Remember Lot's wife.<br>
<br>
Luke 17, Verses 31 through 33 (KJV):<br>
(Here we have Jesus talking about that day when the Kingdom of God should come, when the Son of Man is revealed and returns.)
...he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.<br>
32 Remember Lot's wife.<br>
33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.<br>
<br>
NLT of Luke 17, Verse 32 and 33:<br>
Remember what happened to Lot's wife! If you cling to your life, you will lose it, and if you let your life go, you will save it. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 8: 21 & 22 (KJV)<br>
And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.<br>
<br>
Matthew 8: 21 & 22 (NLT)
Another of his disciples said, "Lord, first let me return home and bury my father." But Jesus told him, "Follow me now. Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead."
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 9:59-62 (KJV)<br>
And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
<br>
<br>
Luke 9:59-62 (NLT)<br>
He said to another person, "Come, follow me."<br>
The man agreed, but he said, "Lord, first let me return home and bury my father."<br>
But Jesus told him, "Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead! Your duty is to go and preach about the Kingdom of God."<br>
Another said, "Yes, Lord, I will follow you, but first let me say good-bye to my family."<br>
But Jesus told him, "Anyone who puts a hand to the plough and then looks back is not fit for the Kingdom of God."<br>
<br>
So if we are not supposed to look back, then what or whom should we fix our eyes on?<br>
Instead of looking back we should look forward, like an athlete running a race, with Jesus standing there at the Finish line.<br>
Someone in a race does not spend all their time looking back at where they used to be, and they don't spend their time looking back and around to see where everybody else is and what they are doing.<br>
When it comes to doing church and going to church, don't look back or compare the present with the past.  Look at what is in front of you and see what you can do to help.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 9:22-26 (KJV)<br>
To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.<br>
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 9:22-26 (NLT)<br>
When I am with those who are weak, I share their weakness, for I want to bring the weak to Christ. Yes, I try to find common ground with everyone, doing everything I can to save some. I do everything to spread the Good News and share in its blessings. Don't you realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run to win! All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize. So I run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 1 - 3 (KJV)<br>
Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.<br>
<br>
Verse 3 may be easier to understand in the NLT:<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 1 - 3 (NLT)<br>
Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith, let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially the sin that so easily trips us up. And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us. We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus, the champion who initiates and perfects our faith. Because of the joy awaiting him, he endured the cross, disregarding its shame. Now he is seated in the place of honour beside God's throne. Think of all the hostility he endured from sinful people; then you won't become weary and give up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:5 (KJV)<br>
And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:5 (NLT)<br>
And the one sitting on the throne said, "Look, I am making everything new!" And then he said to me, "Write this down, for what I tell you is trustworthy and true."<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 5:17 (KJV)<br>
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 5:15-18 (NLT)<br>
He died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves. Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them. So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now! This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun! And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 42:9 (KJV)<br>
Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 48:6 (KJV)<br>
Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 48:6 (NLT)<br>
You have heard my predictions and seen them fulfilled, but you refuse to admit it. Now I will tell you new things, secrets you have not yet heard.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 48:8 (NLT)<br>
"Yes, I will tell you of things that are entirely new, things you never heard of before.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 4:17 (NLT)<br>
That is what the Scriptures mean when God told (Abraham), "I have made you the father of many nations." This happened because Abraham believed in the God who brings the dead back to life and who creates new things out of nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 3: 4 - 7 (KJV)<br>
...the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,<br>
Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 3:5 (NLT)<br>
he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 42:16 (KJV)<br>
And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 42:16 (NLT)<br>
I will lead blind Israel down a new path, guiding them along an unfamiliar way. I will brighten the darkness before them and smooth out the road ahead of them. Yes, I will indeed do these things; I will not forsake them.<br>
<br>
To repent means to change direction.  How do we repent?<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (KJV)<br>
...the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.<br>
<br>
Strong's Greek Definition for Goodness comes from the Greek word "chrestos"<br>
which means, kind, easy, better, gracious, fit for use, useful, virtuous, good, benevolent, manageable, mild, pleasant (as opposed to being harsh, hard, sharp or bitter)<br>
<br>
The word, "benevolent" is an interesting word.<br>
<br>
The Chambers 21st Century Dictionary says that benevolent is "showing or involving kindness and generosity... for the benefit of others rather than for profit; charitable."<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (NLT)<br>
Can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (NIV)<br>
...do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?<br>
<br>
Strong's Greek Definition for Repentance is based on the Greek word<br>
"metanoia", which is based on "metanoeo"<br>
which means, "a change of mind, to change one's mind for the better"<br>
<br>
When you want to change your mind and change direction, just turn to and look upon Jesus and he will kindly lead you in the right direction.  His kindness and his goodness is intended to be used for that very purpose of helping you go in the right direction.<br>

<br>
Let's look again at what the original church service looked like.
The early church service consisted of four things:<br>
1. "continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine" --- continuing to Read the Bible<br>
2. Breaking of bread -- the Lord's Supper -- Communion<br>
3. Fellowship -- Gathering Together, meeting together, being together as a group of people<br>
4. Praying<br>
<br>
We have looked at Communion, Fellowship and Prayer, and we see that the Bible tells us that we need to go to church.<br>
One more thing to think about is how they "continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine," which was reading the Bible.<br>
If reading the Bible was an important part of having a church service, how much more important would it be for us personally, as individuals?<br>
<br>
Commentary:  My advice to you is to read your Bible and pray, every single day.  Read the entire Bible from cover-to-cover, and don't give up.  Go to a "through-the-Bible" church, which is a church that reads the entire Bible to the church, not skipping around, not hovering only here and there, and avoiding other areas.  That's like only eating dessert, and avoiding the meats, fruits and veg that will make you strong when storms and troubles come your way.  For you, read the Bible and pray every single day.  Try to just read a page a day.  Read one page each day. Read every page completely, and don't skim or skip anything.  If you are a new Christian, start in the New Testament if you need to, and go all the way to the end.  Read all of the Old and New Testament, from cover to cover, and repeat this cover-to-cover, through the Bible daily reading until you are safely deposited into Heaven.  If what you read does not make any sense, and you don't understand it, keep reading.  It will make more sense the next time through. If all you are reading sounds kind of boring, keep reading.  You will realise its value and significance the next time through.  If all you are reading are just a bunch of names and places that you cannot pronounce, that's OK, just keep reading. Jesus knows you by name, calls you by name and prays for you by name, and He was doing that even before you had a name! Try to pronounce it, then just keep going.  It's OK. Don't stop and don't give up.  If a day or a whole week even go by where you were too busy to read a page each day, that's OK. You are thinking about it right now, so how about reading a page today, right now?  If you don't have a Bible, there are many churches and places that will give you one for free, and there are many websites where you can read the entire Bible on the Internet, for free, so you are without excuse.<br>

Again, these translations are accurate and trustworthy:<br>
King James Version (KJV) (1611)<br>
New King James Version (NKJV) (1982)<br>
New International Version (NIV) (1978)<br>
New Living Translation (NLT) (1996, with revisions published in 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2015.)<br>
New American Standard Bible (NASB) (1995)<br>
<br>
Any other translation should be avoided.  There are some fake and inaccurate translations out there, so just stick with the above.  The most enjoyable way to read your page-a-day is to have a Parallel Bible.  Check your local or online bookstore for a Parallel Bible.  Make sure it only has any of the above translations only.  When doing your page-a-day reading, I would suggest that you read the NLT first, then immediately read the same thing in KJV.  Find out what a Parallel Bible is and how it works, and read a page of NLT followed by the same page in KJV, and you will be blessed, and your knowledge and wisdom will increase.  If you can't afford or find a Parallel Bible, then at least read a page each day in one of the above translations.  Even if it didn't seem to do much for you, you were at least taking a moment to focus your attention on the Lord, by letting his word enter into you, even if it's just a page each day.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are at least five different editions out there of the New Living Translation<br>
First edition: 1996<br>
Second edition: 2004<br>
Third edition: 2007<br>
Fourth edition: 2013<br>
Fifth edition: 2015<br>

The first edition is still considered to be a fairly good translation, but the newer editions are additional attempts to help improve the accuracy and precision of the NLT.<br>
The NLT is not just a word-for-word translation, but a thought-for-thought translation, trying to help give more thoughtful meaning and understanding of what was trying to be originally communicated.<br>
<br>
Different people all reading from the NLT may not each see the exact same wording in the NLT, due to the multiple revisions published.<br>

<br>
It's interesting how, the first thing we looked at, and the first thing the book of Acts mentioned, was the importance of reading the Bible, and now we bring this study to a close by seeing what other people have to say about the importance of reading the Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some various sayings about the Bible.<br>
Some of these quotations and sayings have been mentioned by various pastors over the years.<br>
Others are actual quotes by famous people that can be found on the Internet.<br>
The famous person's year of birth and year of death are enclosed in round brackets.<br>
<br>
Go through the entire Bible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go through the Bible, so that the Bible can go through you.<br>
<br>
Don't judge the Bible, let the Bible judge you.<br>
<br>
The greatest, most trusted authority on the Bible, is the Bible.<br>
<br>
Either the Bible will keep you away from sin, or sin will keep you away from the Bible.&nbsp; (This was likely a quote originally said by Dwight L. Moody)<br>
<br>
The Bible is not something that you use to hit people over the head with, and it's not something that you rub so you can get your three wishes.<br>
<br>
The Bible is an acronym.&nbsp;  B I B L E stands for, Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth.&nbsp; When all else fails, read the instruction manual.<br>
<br>
The Bible is not an instruction manual, it's more like a love letter.<br>
<br>
"A Bible that's falling apart usually belongs to someone (who's not)."  -- Charles H. Spurgeon<br>

<br>
<br>
Spoken by Donald Trump on the morning of 08 February 2018.<br>
<br>
"Faith is central to American life and to liberty.  Our founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence.  Our currency declares, "In God We Trust."  And we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance and proclaim we are "One Nation Under God."<br>
<br>
"Our rights are not given to us by man; our rights come from our Creator.  No matter what, no Earthly force can take those rights away.  That is why the words "Praise be to God" are etched atop the Washington Monument, and those same words are etched into the hearts of our people.<br>
<br>
"So today, we praise God for how truly blessed we are to be American.  Across our land, we see the splendour of God's creation.  Throughout our history, we see the story of God's providence.  And in every city and town, we see the Lord's grace all around us, through a million acts of kindness, courage and generosity.  We love God.<br>
<br>
"We see the Lord's grace in the servicemembers who risk their lives for our freedom.  We see it in the teachers who work tirelessly for their students, and the police who sacrifice for our communities -- and sacrifice they do.<br>
 <br>
"And we see the Lord's grace in the moms and dads who work two and three jobs to give their children the chance for a better and much more prosperous and happier life.<br>
<br>
"As the Bible tells us, for we are God's handiwork, created in Jesus Christ to do good works."<br>
<br>
Quoted from Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States, (born in 1946)<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2:10 (KJV)<br>
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. <br>

<br>
Let's end this Bible Study with a good prayer.<br>
My Father in Heaven, My Dear, Heavenly Father, Almighty, Holy God, Messiah, Lord Jesus Christ:  Thank you for letting me have this moment of searching the Scriptures to learn more about you, your name and your nature. You have shown me what the original, first church service looked like. It can be a challenge trying to make it to church with a happy heart, ready to gladly receive you and take you in.  Don't let Satan use me before church.  Don't let Satan try to get me in a bad mood before or on the way to church.  Help me find and stay plugged in to a church that reflects or imitates all of the qualities and characteristics of the original church service that is modelled and demonstrated here in the Bible.  Help me to read my Bible, my entire bible again and again, and to pray every single day.  I pray for all of the pastors, deacons, elders, and other people in leadership, on staff or volunteering for my church.  Help us all to walk with you, and represent you.  Show us how we can help others get closer to you and become more like you.  Help us not cause others to be pushed farther away from you, by mis-representing you or even by just making a mistake or saying or doing something accidentally that could cause someone to trip or stumble.  I pray for all of those that used to go to my church, and now are someplace else.  If any of those people are not going to any church, go to them now, and minister unto them, heal them, and let there be forgiveness.  There were many Bible verses in this study, and help me remember and actually do them.  Reading a Bible verse is one thing, but I need help actually doing what the Bible commands me to do. May they all be written on my heart and reflected in my actions and desires.  I thank you for the work you did on the cross, I praise you for your mercy enduring forever, and your grace being enough for me.  I thankfully receive your forgiveness.  Enter into my mind, my heart and my soul, and guide me, pilot me and direct me. I pray blessing and protection upon our church, everyone that attends and is in leadership at my church, and all of the marriages and families. Help churches boldly preach the gospel message, making sure that the random, one-time church visitor is given the Romans 10:9 opportunity to receive, accept and believe in Jesus and receive the free gift of Eternal life before he or she walks out that door never to be seen in that church again. Help me not be shy or afraid to do proper, Godly fellowship. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to read the Bible, and thank you for helping me attend church.  I lift all these prayers up to you, in the name of Jesus Christ, and I ask for these things in Jesus' most precious name, Amen, so be it, let it become true.  Hallelujah!<br>

<p>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God -- Romans 3:23 (KJV)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BREED FETCH</p>
<p>It's an acronym:</p>
<p>B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we back-up these BREED FETCH items with some Scripture? Oh Yeah.  Watch this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B - Believe IN THE LORD<br />
  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. -- Romans 10:9 (KJV)</p>
<p>If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. -- Romans 10: 9 &amp; 10 (NLT)</p>
<p>Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. -- John 6: 28 &amp; 29 (KJV)</p>
<p>Commentary:&nbsp; All the work that needed to be done so that we can go to Heaven, instead of hell, Jesus did that work on the Cross for us.&nbsp; That is why...</p>
<p>...He said, It is finished: and he bowed his head...  John 19:30 (KJV)</p>
<p>And (Abraham) believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.  Genesis 15:6 (KJV)</p>
<p>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.  -- Mark 9:23 &amp; 24 (KJV)</p>
<p>&quot;Anything is possible if a person believes.&quot; The father instantly cried out, &quot;I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief!&quot;  -- Mark 9:23 &amp; 24 (NLT)<br />
</p>
<p>R - Rest IN THE LORD</p>
<p>Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not...  Psalms 37:7 (KJV)</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve. -- Isaiah 14:3 (KJV)</p>
<p>Help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. -- 2 Chronicles 14:11 (KJV)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E - Eyes on THE LORD</p>
<p>Commentary:&nbsp; Peter was walking on water and he did not sink until he took his eyes off of The Lord, focusing on his predicament and the physical, worldly circumstances around him.<br />
  Like walking on water, too many bills, and not enough money, you can be in a physically and financially impossible situation and you will be alright as long as you keep your eyes on the Lord.</p>
<p>And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.  -- Matthew 14:26-32 (KJV)</p>
<p>When the disciples saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. In their fear, they cried out, &quot;It's a ghost!&quot; But Jesus spoke to them at once. &quot;Don't be afraid,&quot; he said. &quot;Take courage. I am here!&quot; Then Peter called to him, &quot;Lord, if it's really you, tell me to come to you, walking on the water.&quot; &quot;Yes, come,&quot; Jesus said.  So Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. But when he saw the strong wind and the waves, he was terrified and began to sink. &quot;Save me, Lord!&quot; he shouted. Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him. &quot;You have so little faith,&quot; Jesus said. &quot;Why did you doubt me?&quot; When they climbed back into the boat, the wind stopped.  -- Matthew 14:26-32 (NLT)</p>
<p>So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him. -- Matthew 20:34 (KJV)</p>
<p>Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the Lord will do before your eyes. -- 1 Samuel 12:16 (KJV)</p>
<p>For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. -- Psalms 26:3 (KJV)</p>
<p>Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. -- Matthew 24:42 (KJV)</p>
<p>Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. -- Mark 13:33 (KJV)</p>
<p>And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. -- Mark 13:37 (KJV)</p>
<p>Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. -- 1 Thessalonians 5:6 (KJV)<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E - Ears listening to THE LORD</p>
<p>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. -- Revelation 2:7 (KJV)</p>
<p>In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice. -- 2 Samuel 22:7 (KJV)</p>
<p>Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. -- Psalms 78:1 (KJV)</p>
<p>The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. -- Isaiah 50:5 (KJV)</p>
<p>But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. -- Matthew 13:16 (KJV)</p>
<p>Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord. -- Deuteronomy 6:4 (KJV)</p>
<p>Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. -- Proverbs 8:33 (KJV)</p>
<p>Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord. -- Ezekiel 16:35 (KJV)</p>
<p>Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. -- Ezekiel 34:7 &amp; 9 (KJV) and</p>
<p>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. -- Ecclesiastes 7:5 (KJV)</p>
<p>I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? -- John 9:27 (KJV)</p>
<p>And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord. -- 2 Kings 20:16 (KJV)</p>
<p>Listen to what the lord our God says. -- Deuteronomy 5:27 (NLT)</p>
<p>You must give them my messages whether they listen or not. -- Ezekiel 2:7 (NLT)</p>
<p>Anyone who belongs to God listens gladly to the words of God. -- John 8:47 (NLT)</p>
<p>My children, listen when your father corrects you. Pay attention and learn good judgment... -- Proverbs 4:1 (NLT)</p>
<p>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. -- Romans 10:17 (KJV)<br />
</p>
<p>D - Delight IN THE LORD</p>
<p>
<br>
Psalms 37:4 (KJV)<br>
Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.<br>
<br>
Psalms 37:4 (NLT)<br>
Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you your heart's desires.<br>
<br>
Commentary: It is possible that a more accurate way of looking at this verse is that, if you delight yourself in the Lord, then the Lord will put into your heart the desires that you are supposed to have in your heart.  The desires that you should have in your heart, God will put those desires into your heart when you delight yourself in the Lord.  Some may get this wrong when they think that whatever desires are sitting in their heart right now, the Lord will give you want you want when you delight yourself in the Lord.  That is not quite accurate.  The Lord is not a genie where you rub your Bible and make three wishes. The purpose of our existence is for his pleasure, as indicated in the book of Revelation. He is not our genie, we are here for Him and for the fulfilment of His plans, His purposes, His kingdom and His glory. <br>
<br>
A Bible verse that backs this up is...<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:13 (KJV)<br>
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:13 (NLT)<br>
For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, if the Bible commands us to delight ourselves in the Lord, how do we go about doing that? Isaiah 58 gives us several ideas on how to do this. We will only look at a few right now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 58:14 (KJV)<br>
If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord....<br>
<br>
Isaiah 58:13 & 14 (NLT)<br>
"Keep the Sabbath day holy. Don't pursue your own interests on that day, but enjoy the Sabbath and speak of it with delight as the lord's holy day. Honour the Sabbath in everything you do on that day, and don't follow your own desires or talk idly. Then the lord will be your delight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 58:2 (KJV)<br>
Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  In Fact, all of Isaiah, Chapter 58, is a great chapter to study. Doing good things does not get a person saved, but if you wanted to think of good things to do that will help you make the Lord become your delight, and help you delight yourself in the Lord, read all of Isaiah 58 for some suggestions.<br>
As Isaiah 58 indicates, just pretending to be a good Christian by only going to church is not actually true worship.<br>
<br>
<br>
Delighting ourselves in the Lord can go both ways. It's a two-way street. It's a relationship. The Lord can also delight Himself in us.<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 22:20 (KJV)<br>
...he delivered me, because he delighted in me.<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 22:20 (NLT)<br>
He led me to a place of safety; he rescued me because he delights in me.<br>
<br>
All of Psalms 1 is beautiful. Here is just a little sample:<br>
<br>
Psalms 1:2 (KJV)<br>
But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.<br>
<br>
Psalms 1:2 (NLT)<br>
...delight in the law of the lord, meditating on it day and night.<br>
<br>
<br>
A Short Prayer:  Lord, show me right now how I can delight myself in you even more. Take out desires in my heart that don't belong there, and put into me the desires that you want me to have in my heart. In Jesus' Name, Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some other Bible verses where it talks about how we can take delight in the Lord, and how the Lord delights in us.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 15:8 (KJV)<br>
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.<br>
NLT<br>
verse 8<br>
The Lord detests the sacrifice of the wicked,<br>
but he delights in the prayers of the upright.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 16:3 (KJV)<br>
But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.<br>
NLT<br>
The godly people in the land<br>
are my true heroes!<br>
I take pleasure in them!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 16, verses 1 through 5<br>
Michtam of David. (A golden Psalm of David.)<br>
(The Hebrew word, miktam, or Michtam, may be a literary or musical term.)<br>
1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.<br>
2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;<br>
3 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.<br>
4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied (that give gifts to another god,) that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.<br>
5 (The Lord is the portion of my part of mine inheritance.) The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 16, verses 1 through 5<br>
NLT<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
Keep me safe, O God,<br>
for I have come to you for refuge.<br>
2<br>
I said to the Lord, "You are my Master!<br>
Every good thing I have comes from you."<br>
3<br>
The godly people in the land<br>
are my true heroes!<br>
I take pleasure in them!<br>
4<br>
Troubles multiply for those who chase after other gods.<br>
I will not take part in their sacrifices of blood<br>
or even speak the names of their gods.<br>
5<br>
Lord, you alone are my inheritance, my cup of blessing.<br>
You guard all that is mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3:12 (KJV)<br>
For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3:12<br>
NLT:<br>
12<br>
For the Lord corrects those he loves,<br>
just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights.<br>
<br>
The Greek version of Proverbs 3:12 NLT:<br>
For the Lord corrects those he loves, <br>
and he punishes those he accepts as his children. <br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 5, 6, and 7 NLT<br>
5<br>
And have you forgotten the encouraging words God spoke to you as his children? (as his sons?)<br>
He said,<br>
"My child, (my son,) don't make light of the Lord's discipline,<br>
and don't give up when he corrects you.<br>
6<br>
For the Lord disciplines those he loves,<br>
and he punishes each one he accepts as his child."<br>
7<br>
As you endure this divine discipline, remember that God is treating you as his own children....<br>
<br>
This spot right here in Hebrews 12, verse 6, is quoting the Greek version of Proverbs 3:12.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 42:1 (KJV)<br>
(The Lord was talking in Isaiah 41, and continues to talk as we go into Isaiah 42. The Lord continues to speak as He says...)<br>
Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: <br>
NLT:<br>
1<br>
"Look at my servant, whom I strengthen.<br>
He is my chosen one, who pleases me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 62:4 (KJV)<br>
Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi–bah, and thy land Beulah: for the Lord delighteth in thee,<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
<br>
4<br>
Never again will you be called "The Forsaken City"<br>
<br>
(The Hebrew name there is, Azubah, which means "forsaken.")<br>
or "The Desolate Land."<br>
(The Hebrew name, Shemamah, means "desolate.")<br>
Your new name will be "The City of God's Delight"<br>
<br>
(The Hebrew name there, Hephzibah, which means "my delight is in her.")<br>
and "The Bride of God,"<br>
(That Hebrew name there, Beulah, means "married.")<br>
<br>
for the Lord delights in you<br>
and will claim you as his bride.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT again of Isaiah 62, verses 1 through 5 without the Hebrew notes that we just looked at...<br>
NLT:<br>
1<br>
Because I love Zion,<br>
I will not keep still.<br>
Because my heart yearns for Jerusalem,<br>
I cannot remain silent.<br>
I will not stop praying for her<br>
until her righteousness shines like the dawn,<br>
and her salvation blazes like a burning torch.<br>
2<br>
The nations will see your righteousness.<br>
World leaders will be blinded by your glory.<br>
And you will be given a new name<br>
by the Lord's own mouth.<br>
3<br>
The Lord will hold you in his hand for all to see--<br>
a splendid crown in the hand of God.<br>
4<br>
Never again will you be called "The Forsaken City"<br>
or "The Desolate Land."<br>
Your new name will be "The City of God's Delight"<br>
and "The Bride of God,"<br>
for the Lord delights in you<br>
and will claim you as his bride.<br>
5<br>
Your children will commit themselves to you, O Jerusalem,<br>
just as a young man commits himself to his bride.<br>
Then God will rejoice over you<br>
as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride.<br>

<p>
<br>
Now let's examine the second acronym, F E T C H.<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>F - Faith IN THE LORD</p>
<p>And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. -- Mark 11:22 (KJV)</p>
<p>And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. -- Luke 17:5 (KJV)</p>
<p>For we walk by faith, not by sight.  -- 2 Corinthians 5:7 (KJV)<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E - Encouragement IN THE LORD<br />
  And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. -- 1 Samuel 30:6 (KJV)</p>
<p>May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope, encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word. -- 2 Thessalonians 2: 16 &amp; 17 (NIV)</p>
<p>Therefore encourage one another with these words. -- 1 Thessalonians 4:18 (NIV)</p>
<p>Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled. -- Titus 2:6 (NIV)</p>
<p>T - Trust IN THE LORD<br />
  Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil. -- Proverbs 3: 5-7 (KJV)</p>
<p>Trust in the lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take.  Don't be impressed with your own wisdom.  Instead, fear the lord and turn away from evil. -- Proverbs 3: 5-7 (NLT)</p>
<p>It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.  It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes. -- Psalms 118:8 &amp; 9 (KJV)</p>
<p>Commentary:&nbsp; If you are saved, your Heavenly Father is your dad, and he is The King of kings and The Lord of lords.  He is the king of all the earth.  So, if he's the king and you are his son, the son of a king is a prince.  That makes every Christian man a prince (and every Christian woman would be a princess). Think about that last verse again.</p>
<p>The verse is repeated just in case you think a Christian (a prince) is the exception to the rule. Also, a literal prince, such as a ruler or government leader, is also not an exception, because they are also just men.  Don't put your confidence in man, just because he's a Christian (a prince) and has a fish symbol on his business card and automobile does not mean to just automatically put your confidence in him.  Do you remember the first two Bible verses here at the very beginning from Romans 3?<br />
  Here they are again...</p>
<p>There is none righteous, no, not one -- Romans 3:10 (KJV)</p>
<p>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God -- Romans 3:23 (KJV)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you should not put your confidence in man (and even Christian man), then who should you put your confidence in?  You should put your confidence in...<br />
</p>
<p>C - Confidence IN THE LORD</p>
<p>For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken. -- Proverbs 3:26 (KJV)</p>
<p>In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. -- Proverbs 14:26 (KJV)</p>
<p>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. -- Philippians 1:6 (KJV)</p>
<p>And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us. -- 1 John 5:14 (KJV)</p>
<p>...for the Lord is your security. He will keep your foot from being caught in a trap.  -- Proverbs 3:26 (NLT)<br />
</p>
<p>H - Hope IN THE LORD</p>
<p>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace. -- 2 Thessalonians 2: 16 (KJV)</p>
<p>Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord. -- Psalms 31:24 (KJV)<br />
</p>
<p>So, there you have it.  BREED FETCH.</p>
<p>The troubles, the storms and the winds are going to try to knock your BREED FETCH out of alignment. When my reception goes bad, I call the great repair man:<br />
  &quot;Lord, help me keep my BREED FETCH focused on you, tuned into you, and following you.&quot;</p>
<p>How can you tell when it's out of alignment?  When you think stuff like this:<br />
  &quot;I need to figure out how I'm going to ______.&quot;  Wait!  WHO is going to figure that out?</p>
<p>Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.  Psalms 55:22 (KJV)</p>
<p>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.  1 Peter 5:7 (KJV)</p>
<p>Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you. 1 Peter 5:7 (NLT)<br />
<br>
To keep the Sin OFF of you, just remember, OFF.<br>
O F F<br>
<br>
Obey the Lord<br>
Fear the Lord<br>
Follow the Lord<br>
<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, I may not remember all the Bible verses that tell me how important it is to Obey the Lord, Fear the Lord and Follow the Lord, even though you have written them all in my heart.  I'm not even sure what it means to have a Fear of the Lord. So, please help me do the things that you want me to do for you and for others, and help me stay away from all of the sin and the evil out there, and the people, places and situations that could be toxic, harmful and destructive to me, unless it is your will that I do, equipped with the full armour of God, like a soldier or first repsonder that runs towards the evil, the disaster and the danger while everyone else is running away from it. In the name of Jesus, I pray, Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are a few Bible verses coming up that do touch on obeying, fearing and following the Lord.<br>

<p>It's not very much fun taking the same pills every day, but what would happen if you stopped taking all of your pills;<br />
  All vitamins, all herbs, all nutrients, all medicines, and all prescription drugs?</p>
<p>Well, taking in the Word of God is like vitamins for your soul, you need that same old Vitamin G and Vitamin J to enter into you everyday.</p>
<p>I know you have taken these pills a bunch of times before, but don't you feel better every time you do?</p>
<p>Well, you might as well finish your plate, here.  I'd hate to see all this good food go to waste... </p>
<p>He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. -- Proverbs 13:20 (KJV)</p>
<p>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels. -- Proverbs 1:5 (KJV)</p>
<p>Those who follow the right path fear the lord; those who take the wrong path despise him. -- Proverbs 14:2 (NLT)</p>
<p>A prudent person foresees danger and takes precautions. The simpleton goes blindly on and suffers the consequences. -- Proverbs 22:3 (NLT)</p>
<p>A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished. -- Proverbs 22:3 (KJV)</p>
<p>Wisdom and money can get you almost anything, but only wisdom can save your life. -- Ecclesiastes 7:12 (NLT)</p>
<p>Pride leads to disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom. -- Proverbs 11:2 (NLT)</p>
<p>Fear of the lord teaches wisdom; humility precedes honour. -- Proverbs 15:33 (NLT)</p>

<p>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- John 14:6 (KJV)</p>
<p>Jesus told him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me. -- John 14:6 (NLT)</p>

<p>
<p>Let's finish this off with a good prayer:<br></p>
<p>My Father in Heaven, My Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty, Holy God, Messiah, Lord, Jesus Christ:  I receive you, accept you and believe in you.&nbsp;  I believe that you died on the cross for my sins, and that God raised you up from the dead, I believe that Jesus Christ and God are one and the same, and that Jesus Christ is Lord.&nbsp;  Help me now to walk with you.&nbsp; Enter into my mind, into my heart and into my soul.&nbsp;  Pilot me, guide me and direct me.&nbsp;  I pray for your blessing and your protection upon me and my family.&nbsp;  Give me instruction, understanding, revelation, guidance and wisdom.&nbsp;  Take my list of right and wrong, and change it, so that it matches your list of right and wrong.&nbsp;  Take my list of priorities, my list of what I think is important and unimportant, and change it, so that it matches your list of what you say is important and not important.&nbsp;  Show me each day what I can do for you, for your glory, for your kingdom, and for your purposes.&nbsp;  </p>
<p>I plead the blood of Jesus on my life and my family.&nbsp; Bless the people that go to my church, and all of those that used to go to my church at one time or another, even if it was just a single visit, and are now someplace else, wherever they are now, they need your help today and every day.&nbsp; Bless them and protect them, and all of their marriages and families.</p>
<p>Lord Jesus, enter into me, and put into me whatever I am lacking or missing.&nbsp;  If I am missing something, physically or spiritually, you can just create it in me.&nbsp;  If you can create the entire universe in just six days, I'm confident that it won't be too hard for you to fix my problems too.&nbsp;  Breathe your way, your truth, and your life into me.&nbsp;  Put into me the thoughts and desires that I should have in me.&nbsp;  Also, as the blood of Jesus is like human blood, travelling throughout the body, as it delivers life into me, I pray you would also carry out and cast out of me anything that does not belong in me, toxins, impurities, toxic thoughts, wasteful desires, and dumb imaginations that have nothing to do with your plans for me.&nbsp;  Bring in the spiritual nutrients, the oxygen, the life, and cast out the wasteful things that waste my time.</p>
<p>I thank you for your mercy, not getting what I do deserve, and your grace, giving me what I don't deserve.&nbsp;  I pray for your mercy, your grace, your compassion, your loving-kindness, and your healing.&nbsp;  I pray for the Spirit of the Lord, the Presence of The Lord, the Glory of The Lord, and the Holy Spirit would enter into me.&nbsp; I may not know what all of those things are, but I know I need all of that every day.&nbsp; I thankfully receive your forgiveness.&nbsp; Thank you for saving me.&nbsp;  Thank you for making me a Christian.&nbsp; I pray for all these things, by the power, and the authority, in the name and the nature of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; In Jesus name, Amen.&nbsp; So be it.&nbsp;  Let it become true.&nbsp; Hallelujah!</p>

Commentary:<br>
The Lord led the Hebrews out of Egypt.<br>
<br>
After the Lord got the Hebrews out of Egypt, He had to get Egypt out of the Hebrews.<br>
<br>
Egypt is a picture, a symbol, that represents the World.<br>
<br>
The Lord led the Hebrews out of and away from the World.<br>
<br>
After the Lord got the Hebrews out of the World, He had to get the World out of the Hebrews.<br>
<br>
As a saved believer, He is preparing a forever-home for you in His Kingdom, and He is preparing you for living in your forever-home in His Kingdom of Heaven.<br>
<br>
Until we finally get to be in Heaven forever, He is preparing the next campsite for you, and He is preparing you for the next Campsite.<br>

Jeremiah 23: 25-27 KJV<br>
25 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.<br>
26 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;<br>
27 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 23: 25-28 NLT<br>
25 "I have heard these prophets say, 'Listen to the dream I had from God last night.' And then they proceed to tell lies in my name.<br>
26 How long will this go on? If they are prophets, they are prophets of deceit, inventing everything they say.<br>
27 By telling these false dreams, they are trying to get my people to forget me, just as their ancestors did by worshipping the idols of Baal.<br>
28<br>
"Let these false prophets tell their dreams,<br>
but let my true messengers faithfully proclaim my every word.<br>
There is a difference between straw and grain!<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Baal is the name of a fake god that was worshipped by the Phoenicians or Canaanites.<br>
They worshiped this fake god in the form of a tall wood stove that had the shape of a statue<br>
that held its arms stretched out forward.<br>
They would heat up the hollow, wood stove metal statue until it started to glow red hot.<br>
And then they would set their babies on the arms and watch them burn to death.<br>
The Bible referred to this as passing their son or daughter through the fire.<br>
The word, Baal, also means, lord.<br>
<br>
It says there in verse 27 that, their fathers have forgotten my name, for Baal.<br>
If Baal can also mean, Lord, then it would be possible to interpret this verse<br>
to be understood like this<br>
their fathers have forgotten my name, Yaw-Who-Wah for Lord.<br>
<br>
This verse predicted, more than 2500 years ago, that, in our English Bibles that we are reading today,<br>
The actual name of our Heavenly Father, Yaw-Who-Wah, would be replaced with the word, Lord.<br>
their fathers have forgotten my name, Yaw-Who-Wah for Lord.<br>
their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Someone took our Heavenly Father's actual name out of our Bibles, and replaced it with the Lord, which is a Hebrew word, pronounced, Baal which is the name of a fake god!<br>
<br>
The name of the LORD is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
We have read many of these next Bible verses previously.<br>
Let's see what they sound like if we place the actual name of the Lord in these Bible verses.<br>
We'll also place the actual, Hebrew name of Jesus Christ, pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw, in the following Bible verses, where Jesus Christ used to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 18:10<br>
The name of Yaw-Who-Wah is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.<br>
<br>
Matthew 28:19<br>
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father Yaw-Who-Wah, and of the Son Yaw-Who-Shaw, and of the Holy Ghost: Hawk-Oh-Desh Roo-Awk, Roo-awk Hawk-Oh-Desh<br> 
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2:19<br>
Nevertheless the foundation of Yaw standeth sure, having this seal, Yaw-Who-Wah knows them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Yaw-Who-Shaw depart from iniquity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 10:13<br>
For whosoever shall call upon the name of Yaw-Who-Wah shall be saved.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 2:21<br>
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Yaw-Who-Wah shall be saved.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 2:38<br>
...Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Yaw-Who-Shaw for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Hawk-Oh-Desh Roo-Awk, Roo-awk Hawk-Oh-Desh.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 3:18 -- KJV<br>
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of Yaw-Who-Shaw, the only begotten Son of Yaw (Jah).<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 5:13<br>
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of Yaw; that ye may know that ye have eternal life?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"There is salvation in no one else! There is no other name in all of heaven for people to call on to save them."<br>
Acts 4:12 (NLT)<br>
<br>
<br>
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.<br>
Acts 4:12 (KJV)<br>

<br>
Some Personal Beliefs<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a list of some personal beliefs and preferences on what we would prefer to see at church meetings and Bible study meetings and gatherings.<br>
<br>
These are preferences and opinions only, which are supported by Bible verses that we will quote and share with you here shortly, but these are not firm laws or rules.<br>
<br>
We happen to include the Bible verses here that support the views and perspectives that we prefer, but there are plenty of other Bible verses that can also support or uphold other perspectives and viewpoints that are different from what we prefer.<br>
<br>
For example, we prefer to attend Bible studies and other meetings and gatherings and feasts where there is no consumption of alcohol.<br>
There are Bible verses that support the perspective of not drinking any alcohol at all, especially if you are an elder or king.<br>
However, there are other Bible verses that do support a moderate and carefully responsible consumption of alcohol.<br>
So, since it is our opinion to preferably avoid all alcohol consumption, and to not attend the feasts, Bible studies, church services or other gatherings that are including alcohol consumption, we will therefore quote the verses that support this no-alcohol perspective, but people have the optional right to include the drinking of alcoholic drinks in the feasts and gatherings they attend, if they choose to, and there are verses that support careful, responsible drinking.<br>
<br>
We are not going to mention the other Bible verses that support the other preferences and beliefs.<br>
<br>
<br>
We are including the verses here that support our particular preferences and perspectives, but there are other Bible verses that support other alternate perspectives which we are not going to also discuss here.<br>
<br>
So, to summarise this, we are going to share our personal beliefs and preferences that we would prefer to have, and not have, at Bible studies, feasts and other fellowship gatherings.<br>
<br>
But, since these are opinions and personal beliefs, please do remember that there are other, different opinions, views and perspectives on how meetings and gatherings should be conducted, and these other, alternate views and opinions can also be backed-up and supported with other Bible verses that we will not be mentioning at this time.<br>
<br>
When we attend Bible studies, Torah studies, Sabbaths, feast gatherings and other fellowship gatherings and meetings,<br>
Here are the things that we would prefer to see at the gatherings, along with content that we would rather not see at church meetings, Bible studies and other fellowship gatherings.<br>
<br>
Well, like we just said a moment ago, when we attend meetings and gatherings,<br>
We do not drink alcohol.<br>
We are not interested in being in meetings with alcohol consumption.<br>
<br>
Mark 14:25 KJV<br>
I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
Mark 14:25 NLT<br>
I tell you the truth, I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We observe Saturdays as a holy, set-apart day of rest.<br>
The Chambers Dictionary definition for the word, Saturday...<br>
the seventh day of the week, dedicated by the Romans to Saturn.<br>
the Jewish Sabbath.<br>
Who changed it to Sunday? The Bible never did.<br>
The Bible says that it is on Saturday, and so do we.<br>
We understand, respect and appreciate that some people may not always be able to make Saturday be their Sabbath day of rest -- people like, doctors, hospital workers, soldiers and emergency responders.<br>
<br>
<br>
no titles, no rabbi<br>
We do not want to attend meetings where people use titles like, rabbi, teacher or master.<br>
Matthew 23: 8-10 KJV<br>
8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.<br>
9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.<br>
10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
unknown language - English please, along with a bit of ancient Hebrew.<br>
If there's going to be some Hebrew, we would prefer to study the ancient Hebrew.<br>
<br>
<br>
When it comes to the actual name of the Heavenly Father, the name of his only begotten Son, and the Holy Ghost, the Spirit that is Holy, we usually like to also say those actual names in the ancient Hebrew language, as well as we can.<br>
But, we like to sometimes say the commonly-known English names, to keep ourselves prepared, in case we have a chance to share with those who only know Him by his common English name.<br>
We like some Hebrew, but we like English to keep us prepared and relatable to English audiences in case we get to share and minister to those that only know English and don't know Him as well as we do.<br>
<br>
<br>
We speak English.  We live in an English-speaking country. We read English Bibles.<br>
We would like to know some of the Ancient Hebrew, which is the same ancient Hebrew that is found in the Old Testament.<br>
We know a few of the Hebrew words and names, but we would prefer to mainly hear, read and study English, in English Bible studies, reading English Bible translations.<br>
Yet, we also like to say His name in Hebrew, as well as we can.<br>
If people speak any Hebrew, we would like to also hear the English equivalent.<br>
Your audience can become lost and disengaged if you talk in an unknown language, making sounds with your voice that no one can understand, making sounds and saying words have no meaning to your audience.<br>
We call Hebrew an unknown language if the English translation is not provided.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 14 KJV -- verse 9, verse 13 and verse 19<br>
9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.<br>
13 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.<br>
19 Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT of 1 Corinthians 14 -- verse 9 and verse 19<br>
9 It's the same for you. If you speak to people in words they don't understand, how will they know what you are saying? You might as well be talking into empty space.<br>
19 But in a church meeting I would rather speak five understandable words to help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
no quarrelling -- mid-rash is not in the Bible<br>
2 Timothy 2: 24 & 25 KJV<br>
24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,<br>
25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2: 23-25 NLT<br>
23 Again I say, don't get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights.<br>
24 A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people.<br>
25 Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people's hearts, and they will learn the truth.<br>
<br>
Titus 3: verse 2 and 9 -- NLT -- -- In the NLT, Titus is being told to Remind the believers that...<br>
2 They must not slander anyone and must avoid quarrelling. Instead, they should be gentle and show true humility to everyone.<br>
9 Do not get involved in foolish discussions about spiritual pedigrees (or spiritual genealogies, and do not get involved) in quarrels and fights about obedience to Jewish laws.<br>
These things are useless and a waste of time.<br>
<br>
<br>
We like to sometimes consider some other books that are not in the Bible, or are no longer in the Bible.<br>
But, we do not want to always place them up as high or higher as the books that are actually in the Bible.<br>
They might be sometimes interesting, and they may sometimes be as valuable and important as the 66 books in the Holy Bible.<br>
The book that we are most interested in studying that is not in the Bible, would be the Book of Enoch.<br>
There may be some books that could just about be as valuable and important as the 66 books in the Holy Bible.<br>
Some books not in the Bible or no longer in the bible, like the book of Enoch, Jasher, Jubilees, and some others, may be worth including in some Bible studies.<br>
We need to be cautious and careful when considering books that are not in the Bible.<br>
We like reading the Eth Cepher in our studies.<br>
We like to cautiously consider and study the additional books provided in the Eth Cepher.<br>
We want a careful balance between studying in the Bible and not in the Bible, not spending too much time not in the Bible, to the point that we neglect to keep studying the 66 books in the Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
We also want full and fair coverage of the entire Old Testament and New Testament.<br>
We do not want to be in meetings where they only park in some areas, and avoid other areas in the Bible all the time.<br>
We need to be going through the entire Bible from cover to cover, so that the entire full counsel of God, the entire Bible, can go through us.<br>
One example of what we do not want to see is a study where they are only studying the Old Testament and completely avoiding the New Testament, or saying diminishing, disrespectful words of criticism about the New Testament all the time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4:2 -- KJV<br>
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4:2 -- NLT<br>
Do not add to or subtract from these commands I am giving you. Just obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 12:32 (KJV)<br>
What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 12:32 (NLT)<br>
So be careful to obey all the commands I give you. You must not add anything to them or subtract anything from them.<br>
<br>
We are not wishing to fully participate in not-in-the-Bible traditions.<br>
We are not interested in traditions, customs and rituals that are not found in the 66 books of the Bible.<br>
We like to observe the Saturday Sabbaths and other Sabbaths associated with the Seven Feasts of the Lord.<br>
We want to study and observe the seven feasts listed in Leviticus 23.<br>
We do not want to do traditions and rituals not mentioned in the Bible for these seven feasts.<br>
We want to do what's in the Bible, and we do not wish to do that which is not in the 66 books of the Bible.<br>
<br>
Placing scripture on your doorpost is in the Bible.<br>
Deliberately posting it crooked and slightly diagonal is not in the bible.<br>
Passover is in the Bible, the Seder feast is man-made and not in the Bible.<br>
Not-in-the-Bible might be interesting, but we do not want to seriously observe and participate fully if it is not in the Bible.<br>
<br>
Mark 7:8 (NLT)<br>
For you ignore God's law and substitute your own tradition."<br>

Some topics and YouTube channels that we like (in 2022), include...<br>

Eth Cepher and the Cepher Publishing Group<br>
Book of Enoch<br>
Zachary Bauer<br>

We would love to learn and observe the seven feasts.<br>
We would love to learn and observe the Sabbaths.<br>
We would love to learn and do and obey the entire Bible, all of the commandments and promises, all of the old testament and all of the new testament.<br>
We need to keep, guard and obey the Old Testament, and we need the mercy, grace, faith and salvation of the New Testament so that we are saved and forgiven, for the remission of sin.<br>
<br>
It is our opinion that the teachings on the YouTube videos from Steve Berkson are false and are in disagreement with the Bible.<br>
<br>
We reject Steve Berkson and his Messianic Torah Observant Israel (MTOI) studies.<br>
If you can't back up what you say and teach with an actual quote of some Bible verses that are in the Bible, then maybe you should not be saying and teaching that.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In summary,<br>
We are basically, mainly consisting of the following characteristics, and we want to be more and more like this, and do more and more of this...<br>
I may not be always perfect at doing all of these things, but I am saved and I am perfectly forgiven.<br>
<br>
I am a<br>
Messiah Following, Torah Seeking,<br>
Sabbath Resting, Feast Keeping,<br>
Shofar Blowing, Clean Eating,<br>
Tzitzit Wearing, Praise Dancing,<br>
Worship Singing, Messiah Awaiting,<br>

Bread of Life Eating, Living Water Drinking<br>
Blood Covered, Spirit Filled,<br>
Grafted In, Born Again, Saved and Forgiven,<br>
Genesis to Revelation, Scripture Believer,<br>
Eternal Life Receiver!<br>
<br>
I am not alone.<br>
I am Redeemed, I am Chosen, I am Accepted,<br>
I Am Loved.<br>
<br>
I Am Israel!<br>

This is the end of the Christian Essays, Page 1.<br>
There are also some Christian Essays on the Christian Page and on the Parallel Bible page.<br>
<br>
All of these Bible studies are generally given the unofficial nickname of, The Bible's Greatest Hits.<br>
Although you can read the Christian Essay pages in whatever order you choose, if you want to basically read them in the regular, default sequence, then you may read them in the following order...<br>
Start with the Parallel Bible, and read straight down to the end.<br>
(The Parallel Bible is unofficially known as chapter zero, with the top 500 Bible verses.)<br>
Next, read Christian Essays 1, which is page 1 or, unofficially, chapter 1.<br>
After you finish Christian Essays 1, go to the Christian Page, and jump down to the Christian Essays that are near the bottom.<br>
The essays on the Christian Page are unofficially referred to as the chapter 1 Bonus Verses.<br>
When you reach the end of the Christian Page, go next to Christian Essays 2, which is also thought of as page 2, or unofficially, chapter 2.<br>
From there you can carry on in the normal numerical sequence, with Christian Essays 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on, all the way to the end.<br>
<br>
Although all of this Bible study content is mainly presented in a random or unpredictable style, you may more likely encounter more advanced topics and Bible studies once you go past Christian Essays 8, also referred to as chapter 8. All of the studies are designed to be easy to learn and understand, for both the new believer, and the more advanced, mature Christian that has already read his or her entire Bible from cover to cover.  The studies will sometimes try to push you past the normal stopping points where most basic, elementary Church services refuse to ascend above in their simple levels of truthful teachings. These studies are not designed to make a church more money and increase their attendance; they are designed to tell you the full truth about topics that churches are too afraid to reveal. If you want to read some true Bible verses that churches would never want you to read, then you've come to the right place.<br>
Keep reading and don't give up, and never stop praying.<br>
