Nehemiah 9: 5-15 -- KJV<br>
...Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.<br>
9:6 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.<br>
9:7 Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;<br>
9:8 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:<br>
9:9 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;<br>
9:10 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.<br>
9:11 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.<br>
9:12 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.<br>
9:13 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven,<br>
and gavest them right judgements, (and laws of truth,) and true laws, good statutes and commandments:<br>
9:14 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:<br>
9:15 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.<br>
(and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst lift up thine hand to give them.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 9: 5-15 -- NLT<br>
"Stand up and praise the Lord your God, for he lives from everlasting to everlasting!" Then they prayed:<br>
"May your glorious name be praised! May it be exalted above all blessing and praise!<br>
6 "You alone are the Lord. You made the skies and the heavens and all the stars. You made the earth and the seas and everything in them. You preserve them all, and the angels of heaven worship you.<br>
7 "You are the Lord God, who chose Abram and brought him from Ur of the Chaldeans and renamed him Abraham.<br>
8 When he had proved himself faithful, you made a covenant with him to give him and his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites. And you have done what you promised, for you are always true to your word.<br>
9 "You saw the misery of our ancestors in Egypt, and you heard their cries from beside the Red Sea (also known as the sea of reeds).<br>
10 You displayed miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh, his officials, and all his people, for you knew how arrogantly they were treating our ancestors. You have a glorious reputation that has never been forgotten.<br>
11 You divided the sea for your people so they could walk through on dry land! And then you hurled their enemies into the depths of the sea. They sank like stones beneath the mighty waters.<br>
12 You led our ancestors by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night so that they could find their way.<br>
13 "You came down at Mount Sinai and spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and instructions that were just, and decrees and commands that were good.<br>
14 You instructed them concerning your holy Sabbath. And you commanded them, through Moses your servant, to obey all your commands, decrees, and instructions.<br>
15 "You gave them bread from heaven when they were hungry and water from the rock when they were thirsty. You commanded them to go and take possession of the land you had sworn to give them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Elohim is the word, God, in Hebrew. It is pronounced, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah is the name of the Lord, the Heavenly Father's actual name in the ancient Hebrew language.<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 9: 5-15 -- TS2009<br>
"Rise, bless Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim forever and ever! And let them bless Your esteemed Name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise!<br>
6 "You are Yaw-Who-Wah, You alone. You have made the heavens, the heavens of the heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that are on it, the seas and all that are in them, and You give life to them all. And the host of the heavens are bowing themselves to You.<br>
7 "You are Yaw-Who-Wah, the Elohim who chose Abram, and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham,<br>
8 and found his heart trustworthy before You, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Kena'anites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites – to give it to his seed. And You have established Your words, for You are righteous,<br>
9 and saw the affliction of our fathers in Mitsrayim (Egypt), and heard their cry by the Sea of Reeds,<br>
10 and gave signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land. For You knew that they acted proudly against them. And You made a Name for Yourself, as it is this day.<br>
11 "And You split the sea before them, and they passed over into the midst of the sea on the dry land. And their pursuers You threw into the deep as a stone into the mighty waters.<br>
12 "And You led them by day with a cloudy column, and by night with a column of fire, to give them light in the way they were to go.<br>
13 "And You came down on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from the heavens, and gave them straight right-rulings and Torot of truth, good laws and commands.<br>
(and gave them straight right-rulings and Torot of truth, -- Torot is the plural of Torah, teaching, good laws and commands, laws of truth, as the truth in the law.)<br>
14 "And You made known to them Your set-apart Sabbath, and You commanded them commands and laws and Torot, by the hand of (Moses) Mosheh (Moe-Shay) Your servant.<br>
15 "And You gave them bread from the heavens for their hunger, and brought them water out of the rock for their thirst, and said to them to go in to possess the land which You had sworn to give them.<br>

Commentary:<br>
The spiritual does not always mix well with the physical, and can cause a sour tummy.<br>
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak, so if you think you have the stomach for these spiritual matters, then this Bible study is for you.<br>
Here again are some Bible verses that talk about how, we need to take, the Old Testament, the New Testament, the old covenant, the new covenant, the Rock, the Bible, the commandments, the Scriptures, the Law, the set of instructions, the Torah, and let it all enter into us, into you, and into me.<br>
We need to take the Torah, and let it enter into us, and when we do, it will be enjoyable, and it will taste good, like eating sweet honey, but it can be sometimes difficult to digest and process and understand.<br>
We taste and eat and trust and obey Torah even if we don't understand why.<br>
Even if you know it's going to give you a sour stomach, eat it anyway.<br>
Some nutritional supplements may cause varying amounts of digestion difficulties, but we know we eventually need those nutritional results and benefits anyway.<br>
Sometimes, Torah is hard to understand.<br>
Eat it anyway. Study, trust and obey Torah anyway, even if you don't understand why sometimes.<br>
Sometimes, Torah is not very happy, with warnings, lamentations, mourning, woe, funeral songs, words of sorrow, and pronouncements of doom.<br>
Eat it anyway. Study, trust and obey Torah anyway, even if it is not happy or fun to read sometimes.<br>
We will see two examples of someone eating a scroll or book.<br>
If this book, this scroll, could possibly be a symbol or representation of the commandments in the Bible, the Torah, then maybe this thought could be true.<br>
If that is the case, and if the scroll or book was Torah, then here is something to think about.<br>
In one example, we will see that the scroll or book, Torah, can be upsetting to digest or process or understand as it enters into you and becomes one with you after eating it.<br>
In the other example, the words written on the scroll or book are upsetting or difficult to process or digest as they enter into your eyes as you read it.<br>
In one example, it enters in through your eyes, and in the other, it enters in through your mouth.<br>
Interesting. Fixing your eyes on him, confessing with your mouth, taste and see, mouth and eyes, taste and see that Torah is good.<br>
Gold is pretty good on the eyes, and honey is good on the tongue.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 19:9-11 (NLT)<br>
9<br>
Reverence for the Lord is pure,<br>
lasting forever.<br>
The laws of the Lord are true;<br>
each one is fair.<br>
10<br>
They are more desirable than gold,<br>
even the finest gold.<br>
They are sweeter than honey,<br>
even honey dripping from the comb.<br>
11<br>
They are a warning to your servant,<br>
a great reward for those who obey them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 19:7-11 (KJV)<br>
(The doctrine of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul:)<br>
19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.<br>
19:8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.<br>
19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgements of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.<br>
(the judgements of the LORD are truth and righteous altogether.)<br>
19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.<br>
(and the dropping of honeycombs.)<br>
19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 19:7-14 (going to the end of Psalms 19)  (TS2009)<br>
7 The Torah of Yaw-Who-Wah is perfect, bringing back the being; The witness of Yaw-Who-Wah is trustworthy, making wise the simple;<br>
8 The orders of Yaw-Who-Wah are straight, rejoicing the heart; The command of Yaw-Who-Wah is clear, enlightening the eyes;<br>
9 The fear of Yaw-Who-Wah is clean, standing forever; The right-rulings of Yaw-Who-Wah are true, They are righteous altogether,<br>
10 More desirable than gold, Than much fine gold; And sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br>
11 Also, Your servant is warned by them, In guarding them there is great reward.<br>
12 Who discerns mistakes? Declare me innocent from those that are secret,<br>
13 Also keep Your servant back from presumptuous ones, Do not let them rule over me. Then shall I be perfect, and innocent of great transgression.<br>
14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be pleasing before You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, my rock and my redeemer.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:101 (TS2009)<br>
I have restrained my feet from every evil way, That I might guard Your word.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119: 101-104 (NLT)<br>
101<br>
I have refused to walk on any evil path,<br>
so that I may remain obedient to your word.<br>
102<br>
I haven't turned away from your regulations,<br>
for you have taught me well.<br>
103<br>
How sweet your words taste to me;<br>
they are sweeter than honey.<br>
104<br>
Your commandments give me understanding;<br>
no wonder I hate every false way of life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119: 101-105 (KJV)<br>
119:101	I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.<br>
119:102	I have not departed from thy judgements: for thou hast taught me.<br>
(How sweet are thy words unto my palate!)<br>
119:103	How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!<br>
119:104	Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.<br>
(Thy word is a candle unto my feet, and a light unto my path.)<br>
119:105	Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34:8 (NLT)<br>
Taste and see that the Lord is good. Oh, the joys of those who take refuge in him!<br>
<br>
Psalms 34:8 (KJV)<br>
34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 34:8 (TS2009)<br>
Tet Oh, taste and see that Yaw-Who-Wah is good; Blessed is the man that takes refuge in Him!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 81: verses 13 and 16 (KJV)<br>
81:13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!<br>
(He should have fed them also with the fat of wheat)<br>
81:16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 81: verses 13 and 16 (TS2009)<br>
13 "O, if My people had listened to Me, Yis-Rye-ELL would walk in My ways,<br>
16 He would feed them with the finest of wheat; And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 81: 13 through 16 (NLT)<br>
13<br>
Oh, that my people would listen to me!<br>
Oh, that Israel would follow me, walking in my paths!<br>
14<br>
How quickly I would then subdue their enemies!<br>
How soon my hands would be upon their foes!<br>
15<br>
Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him;<br>
they would be doomed forever.<br>
16<br>
But I would feed you with the finest wheat.<br>
I would satisfy you with wild honey from the rock."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 32: 12 & 13 (NLT)<br>
12<br>
The Lord alone guided them;<br>
they followed no foreign gods.<br>
13<br>
He let them ride over the highlands<br>
and feast on the crops of the fields.<br>
He nourished them with honey from the rock<br>
and olive oil from the stony ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 32: 12 & 13 (KJV)<br>
32:12 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.<br>
32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 32: 11-13 (TS2009)<br>
11 "As an eagle stirs up its nest, Flutters over its young, Spreading out its wings, taking them up, Bearing them on its wings.<br>
12 "Yaw-Who-Wah alone led him, And there was no strange mighty one with him.<br>
13 "He made him ride in the heights of the earth, And he ate the fruit of the fields, And He made him to draw honey from the rock, And oil from the flinty rock,<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 2:6, and we will keep reading into Ezekiel 3, stopping at verse 4 -- KJV<br>
2:6 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though (rebels and) briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.<br>
2:7 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear:<br>
for they are most rebellious.<br>
(for they are most rebellion.)<br>
2:8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.<br>
2:9 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;<br>
2:10 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.<br>
3:1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.<br>
3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.<br>
3:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.<br>	 		 
3:4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 2:6, and we will keep reading into Ezekiel 3, stopping at verse 4 -- NLT<br>
6 "Son of man, do not fear them or their words. Don't be afraid even though their threats surround you like nettles and briers and stinging scorpions. Do not be dismayed by their dark scowls, even though they are rebels. <br>
7 You must give them my messages whether they listen or not. But they won't listen, for they are completely rebellious! <br>
8 Son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not join them in their rebellion. Open your mouth, and eat what I give you."<br>
9 Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me. It held a scroll,<br>
10 which he unrolled. And I saw that both sides were covered with funeral songs, words of sorrow, and pronouncements of doom.<br>
1 The voice said to me, "Son of man, eat what I am giving you -- eat this scroll! Then go and give its message to the people of Israel."<br>
2 So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll.<br>
3 "Fill your stomach with this," he said. And when I ate it, it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.<br>
4 Then he said, "Son of man, go to the people of Israel and give them my messages.<br>
<br>
<br>
Israel, in the Hebrew language, is pronounced, Yis-Rye-ELL.<br>
The Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, is speaking to Ezekiel, calling Ezekiel, son of man.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 2:6, and we will keep reading into Ezekiel 3, stopping at verse 4 -- TS2009<br>
6 "And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or discouraged by their looks, for they are a rebellious house.<br>
7 "And you shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they are rebellious.<br>
8 "And you, son of man, hear what I am speaking to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house, open your mouth and eat what I am giving you."<br>
9 And I looked and saw a hand stretched out to me. And see, a scroll of a book was in it,<br>
10 and He spread it before me, and it was written on the inside and on the outside. And written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.<br>
1 And He said to me, "Son of man, eat what you find, eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Yis-Rye-ELL."<br>
2 And I opened my mouth, and He fed me the scroll.<br>
3 And He said to me, "Son of man, feed your stomach, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I am giving you." And I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.<br>
4 And He said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Yis-Rye-ELL, and you shall speak to them with My words.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 10: 1-10 (NLT)<br>
1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, surrounded by a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face shone like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.<br>
(And in his hand was a small book that had been opened.)<br>
2 And in his hand was a small scroll that had been opened. He stood with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.<br>
3 And he gave a great shout like the roar of a lion. And when he shouted, the seven thunders answered.<br>
4 When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Keep secret what the seven thunders said, and do not write it down."<br>
(Seal up what the seven thunders said, and do not write it down.)<br>
5 Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward heaven.<br>
6 He swore an oath in the name of the one who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and everything in them, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. He said, "There will be no more delay.<br>
7 When the seventh angel blows his trumpet, God's mysterious plan will be fulfilled. It will happen just as he announced it to his servants the prophets."<br>
8 Then the voice from heaven spoke to me again: "Go and take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."<br>
9 So I went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll. "Yes, take it and eat it," he said. "It will be sweet as honey in your mouth, but it will turn sour in your stomach!"<br>
10 So I took the small scroll from the hand of the angel, and I ate it! It was sweet in my mouth, but when I swallowed it, it turned sour in my stomach.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 10: 1-10 (KJV)<br>
10:1 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:<br>
10:2 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,<br>
10:3 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.<br>
10:4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.<br>
10:5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,<br>
10:6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:<br>
10:7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.<br>
10:8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.<br>
10:9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.<br>
10:10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 10: 1-10 (TS2009)<br>
1 And I saw another strong messenger coming down from the heaven, robed in a cloud, and a rainbow on his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like columns of fire,<br>
2 and having in his hand a little book opened. And he placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,<br>
3 and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. And when he cried out, seven thunders spoke their sounds.<br>
4 And when the seven thunders spoke their sounds, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from the heaven saying to me, "Seal up what the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them."<br>
<br>
5 And the messenger whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the heaven,<br>
6 and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there shall be no further delay,<br>
<br>
7 but in the days of the sounding of the seventh messenger, when he is about to sound, the secret of Elohim shall also be ended, as He declared to His servants the prophets.<br>
8 And the voice which I heard out of the heaven spoke to me again and said, "Go, take the little book which is opened in the hand of the messenger standing on the sea and on the earth."<br>
9 And I went to the messenger and said to him, "Give me the little book." And he said to me,<br>
(Take it, and let it enter into you to receive knowledge, and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth.)<br>
"Take and eat it, and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth."<br>
10 And I took the little book out of the messenger's hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.<br>

Enoch Review<br>
<br>
In this study, we will look again at some verses from the Book of Enoch,<br>
and then, after reading a few other things, we will finish up by looking at something interesting<br>
that can be seen in The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) translation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look again at some selected verses from The Book of Enoch.<br>
The previously lost Book of Enoch is not in the Holy Bible today, but many experts believe that it used to be.<br>
And several experts may argue that it should be put back into the Bible.<br>
The Book of Enoch is referenced in the New Testament at least 40 times.<br>
Jesus Christ actually quotes and refers to The Book of Enoch in some of his conversations, teachings and sermons.<br>
<br>
We also did some studying of The Book of Enoch back in Christian Essays 4 and in Christian Essays 7.<br>
<br>
<br>
In fact, we have had here at least four other Bible studies where we looked at the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
When we were in Christian Essays 4 -- We did a Bible study, titled, Enoch Samples.<br>
That study had a short outline of the Book of Enoch,<br>
and it compared The Eth Cepher English Translation, the 2017 Cepher, 3rd Edition,<br>
with the Archbishop Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation.<br>
We will look at some of those verses again, here, in just a moment.<br>
This time, however, we will be reading from an updated 2020 edition of the Eth Cepher.<br>
<br>
<br>
When we were in Christian Essays 7 -- We did a Bible study, titled, Enoch in the Bible.<br>
In that study, we looked at the places that talk about Enoch in the Bible,<br>
and this study mentioned the areas in the Bible of several other Bible books that are no longer in our Bible.<br>
We saw there how the Bible gives us titles of Bible books that are not in our Bible anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
When we were in Christian Essays 10 -- We did a Bible study, titled, Evil Knowledge.<br>
We asked the question, What is evil knowledge?<br>
The book of Enoch tells us. The fallen angels brought the evil knowledge to earth and gave this evil knowledge to humans.<br>
We found out what their names were, and what types of evil knowledge each one shared and delivered to the Earth.<br>
The knowledge of the sweet and the bitter could be pointing to herbology, which is the study of herbs and nutrients, sweet herbs and bitter herbs.<br>
Herbs and nutrients can be used for good, and they can be used for evil, as in making a pregnant woman have an abortion,<br>
or alchemy, making witchcraft spells and potions, which, as we saw in that study, when used in that way, is clearly sin and is an example of knowledge used for evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
And when we were in Christian Essays 22 -- We did a Bible study, titled, Seven Feast Dates and Calculations.<br>
The Book of Enoch had some interesting verses that can be used for calculating when to do the Seven Feasts, which the Bible commands us to do.<br>
It also talked about the position of the sun in the sky, and how it changes throughout the year.<br>
We mentioned in that study that Enoch is 100% equating the month to the cycle of the moon, as well as confirming the exit of light from the moon being equivalent to the month ending.<br>
In other words, the Book of Enoch tells us how the moon light and moon cycles define when a month starts and ends.<br>
<br>
<br>
Since we will be looking at some Enoch verses again in the Eth Cepher, let's review some words and names in the ancient Hebrew language.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some approximate ways to pronounce and spell some words and names in the ancient Hebrew language, using English letters.<br>
Enoch is pronounced, EE-Knock. Enoch's name in Hebrew is pronounced, Haw-Nook.<br>
Using English letters instead of Hebrew characters,<br>
Enoch is spelled, E n o c h .<br>
Again, Enoch's name in Hebrew is pronounced, Haw-Nook.<br>
To spell Haw-Nook with English letters, it may end up being spelled like this.<br>
Haw-Nook can be spelled, C h a n o k .<br>
So if you see the word, Chanok, it looks like it would be pronounced, Cha-Knock,<br>
but it is actually pronounced, Haw-Nook, which is Enoch's name in Hebrew.<br>
<br>
The name of the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob, the name of the Lord, our heavenly Father, is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah if spelled using English letters, could possibly be spelled like this: Y a h u a h .<br>
In Hebrew, The Lord of Hosts is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat.<br>
So, every time there was the Hebrew words, Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat, we use the English term, The Lord of Hosts.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat, which is, the Lord of Hosts, can also mean, God of Hosts, Lord Yaw-Who-Wah God of Hosts, The Lord of Armies, The Lord of Heaven's Armies, The Lord of the Angel Armies, the God of Angel Armies, and the God of the Armies of Heaven.<br>
To spell Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat using English letters, it could be spelled like this, Y a h u a h (space) T s e v a (apostrophe) o t h .<br>
<br>
The name of Jesus in Hebrew is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, is known as the Elect One in the book of Enoch.<br>
Jesus is Salvation.  To say that in Hebrew, we would say, Yaw-Who-Shaw is Yeh-Shoe-Uh.<br>
Yeh-Shoe-Uh means, Salvation in Hebrew.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for God, is, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
To spell ELL-Low-Heem with English letters, it could be spelled like this, E L o h i y m ,<br>
or sometimes, with an I instead of a Y, like this: E l o h i m .<br>
Elohim, with the letter I, is how it is spelled in the TS2009.<br>
In the Eth Cepher, it is spelled with a Y, like this, E L o h i y m .<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 42:1 (KJV)<br>
Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgement to the Gentiles.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:18 (KJV)<br>
Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; My beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, And he shall shew judgement to the Gentiles.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45:4 (KJV)<br>
For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 43:10 (KJV)<br>
Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 1:1 -- English translation from the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1<br>
The word of the blessing of Enoch, how he blessed the elect and the righteous, who were to exist in the time of trouble; rejecting all the unrighteous and wicked. Enoch, a righteous man, who with God, answered and spoke, whilst his eyes were open, and he saw a holy vision in the heavens.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Most of these Enoch verses are the same ones that we have studied<br>
when we did the Bible study, titled, Enoch Samples<br>
back in Christian Essays 4.<br>
<br>
This time, we will only be reading them out of the<br>
Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1, by Cepher Publishing Group.<br>
Eth is pronounced, eht, as in the word, set, without the s sound.<br>
<br>
Remember that other English translations of the book of Enoch<br>
will have different chapter numbers and verse numbers<br>
which are usually off by one.<br>
<br>
You can find a few more English translations for free on the internet<br>
but their chapter numbers and verse numbers will not be matching up with each other.<br>
<br>
By the way, at the end of Dr Stephen Pidgeon's Preface of the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1<br>
He mentions something interesting about his analysis of the word, the people and the nation of Israel.<br>
As for the correct pronunciation of the word, Israel, he says this:<br>
"Therefore, we have concluded that the word spelled with the letters yod-shin-resh-aleph-lamed is to be pronounced "Yashar'el".<br>
<br>
So, in English, we say Is-Real.<br>
In the TS2009 translation, they say Yis-Rye-ELL.<br>
and the preface that we just quoted from, says, that Israel, if pronounced with precise technical accuracy, is supposed to be pronounced, Yaw-Shaw-Rell.<br>
So, Is-Real, Yis-Rye-ELL, Yaw-Shaw-Rell, are all referencing the nation, and the people of Israel.<br>
Since this entire Bible Greatest Hits Bible study series is an English study targeting an English audience,<br>
we say and pronounce names and places in the English language, even though those English pronunciations are technically wrong or inaccurate.<br>
So, when we say that we worship the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob,<br>
In English, those names of Abraham, Issac and Jacob -- that is not how they would be pronounced in the ancient Hebrew language.<br>
So, just keep that in mind, that, all of these English name pronunciations of Hebrew people and Hebrew cities, these English pronunciations are wrong in one way or another.<br>
Perhaps by a lack of education, ignorance, or just having a lack of access to this language information.<br>
Maybe, there were those that don't want you to know how to say those names, and they deliberately changed the name spelling a little bit?<br>
Research would need be done to investigate that further as to why we pronounce these names incorrectly in the English language.<br>
<br>
So, to summarise this...<br>
Is-Real, is instantly understood in English, but technically wrong.<br>
Yis-Rye-ELL, is more accurate, and it is found that way in the TS2009, but that may still not be exactly, perfectly accurate.<br>
Yaw-Shaw-Rell, is the most technically perfect way of saying Israel in the ancient Hebrew language, but most people may not know this, and most people and most audiences may not be able to understand, stay engaged and keep following along in a Bible study if this most correct pronunciation is used, unless the audience is educated about this, like we are doing right now.<br>
<br>
We need to be careful and sensitive to those that only know English, because, the ancient Hebrew language, as beautiful and important as it is, can technically be an unknown language to an English audience.<br>
<br>
NLT of 1 Corinthians 13 -- verse 9 and verse 19<br>
9 It's the same for you. If you speak to people in words they don't understand, how will they know what you are saying? You might as well be talking into empty space.<br>
19 But in a church meeting I would rather speak five understandable words to help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language.<br>
<br>
These are the same selections that were chosen by Dr Stephen Pidgeon in May 2020, as being some of the most important and significant verses in the the Book of Enoch.<br>
These selected Enoch verses are also all listed in the Preface of the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1 .<br>
and almost all of these are the verses that we looked at before<br>
when we did the Bible study, titled, Enoch Samples<br>
back in Christian Essays 4.<br>
<br>
Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One quotes from the book of Enoch many times, which proves that Enoch is valid Scripture and is an official book of the Bible.<br>
<br>
The Eth Cepher only says the names in Hebrew. We will insert the English names here, so you can easily associate the English names with their corresponding Hebrew names.<br>
So, let's begin. These verses, the chapter numbers and verse numbers, all come from<br>
-- the English translation from the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 62:1<br>
Thus, The Lord, Yahuah commanded the kings, the princes, the exalted, and those who dwell on earth, saying: Open your eyes, and lift up your horns, if you are capable of comprehending Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 39: 5 & 6<br>
5 At that time my eyes beheld the dwelling of the elect, of truth, faith, and righteousness.<br>
6 Countless shall be the number of the holy and the elect, in the presence of God, Elohiym forever and ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 40: 3-7<br>
3 Then I heard the voices of those upon the four sides magnifying The Lord, Yahuah of glory.<br>
4 The first voice blessed The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth forever and ever.<br>
5 The second voice I heard blessing Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One, and the elect who suffer on account of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth.<br>
6 The third voice I heard petitioning and praying for those who dwell upon earth and supplicate the name of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth.<br>
7 The fourth voice I heard expelling the impious angels and prohibiting them from entering into the presence of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth, to accuse the inhabitants of the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 45: 3 & 4<br>
3 In that day shall Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One sit upon a throne of glory; and shall choose their conditions and countless habitations, whilst their spirit within them shall be strengthened, when they behold Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, my Elect One, for those who have fled for protection to my holy and glorious name.<br>
4 In that day I will cause Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, my Elect One to dwell in the midst of them; will change heaven; will bless it and illuminate it forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 45:3 gets quoted by Jesus himself, when he quotes it in<br>
John 14: 2 & 3 -- KJV<br>
14:2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<br>
14:3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 49: 1-4<br>
1 Wisdom is poured forth like water, and glory fails not before him forever and ever; for potent is he in all the secrets of righteousness.<br>
2 But iniquity passes away like a shadow and possesses not a fixed station: for Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One stands before The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth; and his glory is forever and ever; and his power from generation to generation.<br>
3 With him dwells the Spirit of knowledge and wisdom, the Spirit of Instruction and the Spirit of Power and (the Roo-Awk) the spirit of those who sleep in righteousness; he shall judge secret things.<br>
4 Nor shall any be able to utter a single word before him; for Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One is in the presence of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth, according to his own pleasure.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 51: 1-3<br>
1 In those days shall the earth deliver up from her womb, and Hell, Hades, She'ol deliver up from hers, that which it has received; and destruction shall restore that which it owes.<br>
2 He shall select the righteous and holy from among them; for the day of their salvation, has approached.<br>
(for the day of their Yeh-Shoe-Uh, has approached.)<br>
3 And in those days shall Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One sit upon his throne, whilst every secret of intellectual wisdom shall proceed from his mouth, for The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth has gifted and glorified him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Satan, the devil, has several names in the Bible, and in other books that used to be in the Bible.<br>
Satan, is also known as, Haw-Saw-Tawn, and also as Ah-Zah-Zell.<br>
Ah-Zah-Zell can be spelled like this: A z a (apostrophe) z e L .<br>
<br>
Enoch 55:5<br>
O you kings, O you mighty, who inhabit the world you shall behold Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, my Elect One, sitting upon the throne of my glory. And he shall judge Satan, Aza'zel, all his associates, and all his hosts, in the name of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth.<br>
<br>
In Hebrew, The Most High God, is pronounced, EL-ELLE-ON.<br>
With English letters, it gets spelled with a letter Y, like this, E L (space) E L y o n .<br>
<br>
Enoch 61: 8-12<br>
8 Then they received the commandment, all in the heavens above; to whom a combined power, voice, and splendour, like fire, were given.<br>
9 And first, with voice, they blessed him, they exalted him, they glorified him with wisdom, and ascribed to him wisdom with the word, and with the breath of life.<br>
10 Then The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth seated upon the throne of his glory Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One;<br>
11 Who shall judge all the works of the holy, in heaven above, and in a balance shall he weigh their actions. And when he shall lift up his countenance to judge their secret ways in the word of the name of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth, and their progress in the path of the righteous judgement of The Most High God, El Elyon (EL-ELLE-ON);<br>
12 They shall all speak with united voice; and bless, glorify, exalt, and praise, in the name of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezra, is a scribe and priest of the 5th century BC,<br>
4 Ezra 2 Esdras is a book that is not in the Bible.<br>
It is thought that this book was written by Ezra,<br>
but some who have analysed it may argue that it may have actually been written by someone else, sometime, it is estimated, between 70 and 218 AD.<br>
Be that as it may, even with that argument in mind, here is a quote from 4 Ezra 2 Esdras, which is also mentioned in the Eth Cepher preface.<br>
<br>
(4 Ezra 2 Esdras) chapter 14: verses 44 through 48 -- English translation from the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1<br>
44 In forty days they wrote ninety-two books.<br>
45 And it came to pass, when the forty days were filled, that The Most High God, El Elyon spoke, saying, The first that you have written publish openly, that the worthy and unworthy may read it:<br>
46 But keep the seventy last, that you may deliver them only to such as be wise among the people:<br>
47 For in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of knowledge.<br>
48 And I did so.

Commentary:<br>
Baruch is pronounced, Bah-Roo-K.<br>
Baruch and Jeremiah witnessed the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem of 587-586 BC.<br>
Baruch, known as, Baruch ben Neriah, who was around back in the 6th century BC, wrote the Book of Baruch.<br>
The second book of Baruch was not written by Baruch.<br>
The books of Baruch are not in the Bible.<br>
The second book of Baruch, known as 2 Baruch, is not Scripture, and was never a book in the Bible.<br>
Its author is unknown.<br>
It was likely written in the late 1st century AD or early 2nd century AD, after the destruction of the Temple in AD 70.<br>
The Eth Cepher preface quotes from 2 Baruch, and 2 Baruch is in the Eth Cepher.<br>
However, because of the author being possibly fake or fraudulent, and since this is a Bible study,<br>
we will not looking at this book here, because it was never one of the books in the Bible historically,<br>
and it is not in our Holy Bibles today, due to this reason.<br>
Generally, it is a good idea to be extra careful and cautious with not-in-the-Bible books, as they can try to sneak in content that is not true.<br>
When the creation of the book is centuries away from the life and death of its supposed author, watch out and be sceptical, as there are some that have tried to write fake or fictional versions of the ancient books, claiming that they are these original, lost books, when, in fact, they are filled with mistakes which prove that they are fake, fictional books which someone was trying to promote as being the real deal.<br>

May ELL-Low-Heem our Ah-Buh Father and our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck give you grace and peace.<br>

<br>
<br>
Galatians 1: 3-7 (NLT)<br>
(May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.)<br>
3 May God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.<br>
4 Jesus gave his life for our sins, just as God our Father planned, in order to rescue us from this evil world in which we live.<br>
5 All glory to God forever and ever! Amen.<br>
6 I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself (through loving mercy) through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News<br>
7 but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4: 12-15 (NLT)<br>
12 ...equip God's people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.<br>
13 This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.<br>
14 Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth.<br>
15 Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Notice here, in just a moment, how the word, Church, will disappear when we read this again in the TS2009.<br>
If one was to do further research and investigation into having the word, Church, in our English translations,<br>
one might conclude that it may not be as good of a word as we might think.<br>
Was this word, Church, inserted into our New Testament English translations?<br>
There are some discussions and arguments about the word, Church, not technically being in the New Testament.<br>
There might be something about the word, Church, that may not be good.<br>
Could some research and investigation reveal a secret hiding behind that word?<br>
It could be a good thing how the TS2009 was careful to avoid inserting the word, Church, into their scriptures.<br>
Let's read that area again in the TS2009, and listen to how it sounds with the word, Church, not being in there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4: 10-21 (TS2009)<br>
10 He who went down is also the One who went up far above all the heavens, to fill all.<br>
11 And He Himself gave some as emissaries, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers<br>
12 for the perfecting of the set-apart ones, to the work of service to a building up of the body of the Messiah,<br>
13 until we all come to the unity of the belief and of the knowledge of the Son of Elohim, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the completeness of Messiah,<br>
14 so that we should no longer be children, tossed and borne about by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of men, in cleverness, unto the craftiness of leading astray,<br>
15 but, maintaining the truth in love, we grow up in all respects into Him who is the head, Messiah,<br>
16 from whom the entire body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the working by which each part does its share, causes growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.<br>
17 So this I say, and witness in the Master, that you should no longer walk as the nations walk, in the futility of their mind,<br>
18 having been darkened in their understanding, having been estranged from the life of Elohim, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart,<br>
19 who, having become callous, have given themselves up to indecency, to work all uncleanness with greediness.<br>
20 But you have not so learned Messiah,<br>
21 if indeed you have heard Him and were taught by Him, as truth is in Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Revelation) 1:8 (TS2009)<br>
"I am the 'Aleph' and the 'Tav', Beginning and End,” says Yaw-Who-Wah "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."<br>
<br>
(Revelation) 1:8 -- English translation from the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1<br>
I am the Aleph and the Tav, the beginning and the ending, says The Lord God, Yahuah Elohiym, which is, and which was, and which is to come, The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth.<br>

<br>
The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew,<br>
and the New Testament was originally written in Greek.<br>
<br>
This is what pastors and Christian Churches have been stating as fact for many years.<br>
<br>
Evidence continues to mount which indicates more and more that the New Testament was originally written in Hebrew, then translated into Greek.<br>
<br>
All of our English Bible translations are translations from Greek, which are really Greek translations from Hebrew.<br>
<br>
If that is so, then, where are the Hebrew copies?<br>
<br>
In January 2020, Justin J. Van Rensburg and The Van Rensburg family did some extensive searching and found that<br>
the Cambridge University Library in the United Kingdom, and in the Vatican Library in Italy<br>
had digital colour photographs of an actual New Testament Hebrew manuscript, which are available online.<br>
<br>
<br>
Justin J. Van Rensburg and The Van Rensburg family have since been carefully translating Hebrew New Testament books<br>
from Hebrew into English.<br>
<br>
<br>
As of December 2021, only a few Hebrew New Testament books have had their English translations completed.<br>
<br>
In December 2021, they had completed their Hebrew-to-English translation of the book of Revelation.<br>
It was published in December 2021, as Version 1.1.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew manuscript used for this Hebrew-to-English translation of the book of Revelation is from the Cambridge University Library.<br>
A similar manuscript was also found in 1806 in one of the Jewish Synagogues in Cochin, India.<br>
Unfortunately, these two manuscripts have not received much attention over the past 200 years since they were brought to the UK.<br>
<br>
<br>
Justin J. Van Rensburg, gives their translation the title, Ele Ha-Sodot – The Hebrew Revelation, which is found at www.HebrewGospels.com.<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Revelation has the English translation on one page, and then the actual Hebrew text on the adjacent page.<br>
The pages alternate back and forth like this.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, that has me curious about something.<br>
What did the Hebrew New Testament do with the Mark of the Beast, 666?<br>
<br>
Let's find out.<br>
<br>
We have previously talked about this, when we studied that number 666<br>
in Christian Essays 18,<br>
when we did a Bible study, titled,<br>
Two hundred and sixteen thousand genes.<br>
<br>
When we studied that number 666 at that time,<br>
we mentioned that it is actually three Greek words right there.<br>
Three Greek Characters.<br>
The first Greek character would mean, six hundred,<br>
the second Greek character would mean, sixty,<br>
and the third Greek character would mean, six.<br>
<br>
And so, in that study, we also mentioned,<br>
<br>
<br>
In the Greek translation,<br>
The first Greek character is pronounced, Schee<br>
The second character is pronounced, See<br>
and the third one is, Steeg-Mah<br>
<br>
What does it say in the Hebrew-to-English translation?<br>
<br>
Let's now look at these verses from the Hebrew-to-English translation by Justin J. Van Rensburg, titled, Ele Ha-Sodot -- The Hebrew Revelation, December 2021, Version 1.1, available at www.HebrewGospels.com<br>
<br>
Revelation 14: 9-12<br>
9 And after this, the third messenger came and said with a great voice, "If one does his prayer (to the image,) to the carved image and to the animal, and take the sign on his hand or on his forehead -<br>
10 this one will drink of the wine of the fury of Yaw-Who-Wah, which is in the cup of fury, and he will be punished with fire and brimstone before his set-apart messengers and the Lamb.<br>
11 And the smoke of their punishment will go up from everlasting and unto everlasting, (forever and ever) and they will not have rest, day or night, those who took the sign and prayed to the carved image."<br>
12 Here is the hope of the set-apart ones, and here are those who do the commandments of Yaw-Who-Wah, and believe in Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 13:18<br>
Here is wisdom and understanding: whosoever has insight needs to reckon the number of the animal, for it is the number of a man, and the amount is found, (and he will find that the amount is) six hundred and sixty and six.<br>
<br>
Here are the Hebrew letters that make up<br>
<br>
six hundred and sixty and six<br>
<br>
<br>
600<br>
Vahv<br>
Tov<br>
Mem<br>
Saudi<br>
All-if<br>
<br>

Salmick<br>
Raysh<br>
<br>
6<br>
Hey<br>
Yould<br>
All-if<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Since Hebrew letters are based on pictures,<br>
do these pictures, presented in this particular sequence, tell us anything about 666?<br>
<br>
<br>
600<br>
Vahv -- Hook, nail (secure)<br>
Tov -- Mark (sign)<br>
Mem -- Water (Chaos)<br>
Saudi -- Fish hook, man on side, catch<br>
All-if -- Head, Strength, crown, first<br>
<br>
<br>
60<br>
Tet -- Tent, wall, force, separation<br>
Salmick -- hand on staff, support, prop<br>
Raysh -- Man's head, first chief, Highest<br>
<br>
6<br>
Hey -- Window, Behold!, Reveal<br>
Yould -- Hand, Work, Deed<br>
All-if -- Head, Strength, crown, first<br>
<br>
Here is a possible or potential way to produce some meaning or interpretation.<br>
These are just some ideas to consider, based on the Hebrew letter pictures and the order presented.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
<br>
The short summary is, the Sign of the Animal, the Mark of the Beast, when hooked into and secured into a man, brings about chaos, taking away man's thinking and strength, and what he seeks first.<br>
It puts up walls of separation.<br>
The Mark of the Beast is a window that can reveal the hand and the head of the Beast, that is, the works and the thoughts of the Beast, and his strategies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
600<br>
Vahv -- Hook, nail (secure)<br>
Tov -- Mark (sign)<br>
Mem -- Water (Chaos)<br>
Saudi -- Fish hook, man on side, catch<br>
All-if -- Head, Strength, crown, first<br>
<br>
600<br>
The Mark of the Beast uses a sharp instrument, like a hook or a nail, to secure itself.<br>
This is in the same way how a hook in a fish secures itself into the fish, securing the direction that the fish will go.<br>
Satan is also trying to be a fisher of men, as he goes fishing with this special hook.<br>
Securing this mark into the self will bring about chaos into the world, as well as chaos into the one who is hooked on it or addicted to worshipping it.<br>
Once the hook is secured, it can weaken and take a man's strength, and make a man lie down on his side, forcing him to take a side.<br>
It catches the man, and, once caught, his head is caught, what he thinks is caught.<br>
His strength is caught, what comes first to mind is now caught and secured.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
60<br>
Tet -- Tent, wall, force, separation<br>
Salmick -- hand on staff, support, prop<br>
Raysh -- Man's head, first chief, Highest<br>
<br>
<br>
60<br>
The Mark of the Beast will cause a wall of separation.<br>
People will be forced to be walled in, forced to live in a tent, or in a walled city or facility.<br>
People will be forced to keep themselves separated.<br>
(That makes me also think about a set-apart people being set-apart.)<br>
The Good Shepherd will have his hand on His staff.  His rod and His staff will comfort us.<br>
He will continue to support us and keep us propped up so we can be victorious.<br>
We will help prop each other up, in the same way how Moses had his arm and staff propped up so they would have the upper hand and the victory.<br>
The Mark of the Beast will force people to separate themselves.<br>
Because they can buy and sell with it, it will appear to prop up the beast, exalting the beast, showing support and allegiance to the beast.<br>
Man's head and what he thinks will be to think of the beast as the first chief, the primary leader, the most high, the highest, the greatest.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6<br>
Hey -- Window, Behold!, Reveal<br>
Yould -- Hand, Work, Deed<br>
All-if -- Head, Strength, crown, first<br>
<br>
6<br>
The Mark of the Beast will eventually be a way to look into the beast.<br>
It will be a window where one can look into and behold what the beast is really doing and thinking.<br>
What the beast's hand is doing, the works he is working and the deeds that he is performing.<br>
That which is going on inside the head of the beast, how the mark strengthens him, and makes him feel glorious and prideful.<br>
The mark of the beast is something that will show and reveal what the beast's hand is really doing, and what the beast's mind is really thinking.<br>
<br>
If the Mark of the Beast is something technological, then this might suggest that, if one can hack into this technology, one can access the thoughts, actions, plans and strategies of the beast.<br>
This hacked, revealing window might be a way to access helpful intelligence to stay one step ahead.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:8<br>
yes Ah-Main! (Yes, surely, truly)<br>
8 "I am the first and the last, the beginning and the end," says the mighty (majestic) Adon, (Ah-Doe-Nye, lord, master) who was and is and will be.<br>

<br>
This first verse is some random advice that comes from a letter from Paul, writing to God's church in Corinth, which was the capital city of Achaia, in the southern region of the Greek peninsula.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 7:27 (NLT)<br>
If you have a wife, do not seek to end the marriage. If you do not have a wife, do not seek to get married.<br>
<br>
Commentary: In other words, do not try really hard to get married, and do not try really hard to get divorced.<br>
You should be be obeying the Lord, God and His son Jesus, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw and the Spirit that is Holy.<br>
You follow Him and His plans. You do not try to make him follow you and your selfish plans. He is the master and you are His servant, not the other way around.<br>
When it comes to major stuff like this, there is a difference in the attitude you have, between getting married and getting divorced,<br>
and trying and seeking to get married, and trying and seeking to get divorced.<br>
The KJV refers to divorcement as putting away.<br>
The Lord clearly communicates to us in Malachi 2, verses 15 and 16, that He really hates divorce.<br>
We studied that during a random moment, about one third of the way down in Christian Essays 4.<br>
Does He really want you to do something that He hates to see done?<br>
If the Lord guides you and directs you to do major stuff like that, and you know that it is His will, then that's good to do that and follow Him and obey Him if you know that He is clearly telling you to do that.<br>
You will have peace in your heart if you know that you are obeying Him.<br>
You follow Him and trust Him. You will see later on why it was always good for you to do so.<br>
He has the better plan. He already knows in advance what will happen if you go in that direction or not.<br>
In just a moment, we will talk about some people in the Bible that decided to obey someone else other than the Lord and His commandments.<br>
Just because you have done great things for the Lord in the past does not mean that you are not susceptible to deceptions and satanic influences.<br>
Keep praying about things, especially if it seems like the words that you are hearing from someone, and the direction that you are going, do not seem to be matching up with the Lord's directions and commandments.<br>
Does the Lord have to insert weaknesses, limitations, controls and restrictions into your life to keep you under control?<br>
Does the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah have to use a bit and bridle to keep you under control?<br>
<br>
Psalms 32:9 (NLT)<br>
Do not be like a senseless horse or mule that needs a bit and bridle to keep it under control."<br>
<br>
<br>
John 21: 19-22 KJV<br>
...And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.<br>	 
21:20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?<br>
21:21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?<br>
21:22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.<br>
<br>
John 21: 19-22 NLT<br>
...Then Jesus told him, "Follow me."<br>
20 Peter turned around and saw behind them the disciple Jesus loved -- the one who had leaned over to Jesus during supper and asked, "Lord, who will betray you?"<br>
21 Peter asked Jesus, "What about him, Lord?"<br>
22 Jesus replied, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? As for you, follow me."<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word, Keipha, is The Aramaic name for 'Peter,' and via Greek transliteration: 'Cephas.'<br>
A number of Aramaic nouns were used in post-exilic Hebrew.<br>
<br>
in Hebrew, Talmid is a disciple,<br>
and the talmidim (pronounced, Tahl-Muh-Deem) is the Plural word that is usually translated as "disciples."<br>
The Hebrew 'Talmid' is a student who learns from his teacher and follows his example.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yeshua means, Salvation, and is used by some as a Hebrew name for 'Jesus.'<br>
Some may argue that Yeshua just means, salvation,<br>
and Yaw-Who-Shaw is the actual Hebrew name for Jesus.<br>
The Van Rensburg Hebrew-to-English translator family argues that 'Yeshua' they believe is short for 'Yehoshua,' which means 'Yah is Salvation,'<br>
<br>
Hebrew-to-English Translation of John<br>
Translated by the Van Rensburg family<br>
Version 1.1 -- April 2021<br>
John 21: 19-22 -- Hebrew-to-English Translation<br>
...And when he had said this, he said to Keipha (Peter), "Come after me!"<br>
20 Then Keipha turned himself back, and saw that talmid (that disciple) whom Yaw-Who-Shaw loved exceedingly, going after him -- he who reclined on his chest at the meal.<br>
21 So when Keipha saw this, he asked Yaw-Who-Shaw (Yeshua),<br>
"What will become of this man?"<br>
22 So Yaw-Who-Shaw said unto him, "I want that he abides here until I will come -- what is it to you? You, come after me!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7:15 (NLT)<br>
"Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves.<br>
<br>
<br>
With all of those things in mind, let's also read something again from the book of 1 Kings, chapter 11.<br>
We were looking at this in more detail back in Christian Essays 25, when we did the study, titled, Leadership Qualifiers.<br>
<br>
Let's read this little snip to remember again what was in 1 Kings, chapter 11, verse 3, verse 4, followed by verses 9 and 10 -- NLT<br>
3 He (King Solomon) had 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines. And in fact, they did turn his heart away from the Lord.<br>
4 In Solomon's old age, they turned his heart to worship other gods instead of being completely faithful to the Lord his God, as his father, David, had been.<br>
9 The Lord was very angry with Solomon, for his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.<br>
10 He had warned Solomon specifically about worshiping other gods, but Solomon did not listen to the Lord's command.<br>
<br>
and so, the Lord raised up Solomon's Adversaries,<br>
Solomon's own official, Jeroboam, Rebels against Solomon,<br>
After Solomon's death, The Northern Tribes Revolt, and Jeroboam Makes Gold Calves.<br>
<br>
This brings us to the chapters that we are going to look at today, in 1 Kings, chapters 12 and 13.<br>
<br>
1 Kings, chapter 12 starting at verse 25, and we keep reading deep into the next chapter, until we get to chapter 13, verse 33 -- KJV<br>
12:25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.<br>
12:26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:<br>
12:27 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.<br>
12:28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.<br>
12:29 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.<br>
12:30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.<br>
12:31 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.<br>
<br>
12:32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and (he went up to the altar, and) he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, (to sacrifice unto the calves that he had made) sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.<br>
<br>
12:33 So (he went up to the altar, and) he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: (and he went up to the altar to burn incense) and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.<br>
<br>
13:1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar (to offer and) to burn incense.<br>
13:2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.<br>
13:3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.<br>
13:4 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.<br>
13:5 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.<br>
<br>
13:6 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, (the man of God besought the face of the LORD,) and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.<br>
13:7 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.<br>
13:8 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:<br>
13:9 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.<br>
13:10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.<br>
13:11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.<br>
13:12 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.<br>
13:13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,<br>
13:14 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.<br>
13:15 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.<br>
13:16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:<br>
(For a word was said to me by the word of the LORD,)<br>
13:17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.<br>
13:18 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.<br>
13:19 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.<br>
13:20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:<br>
13:21 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,<br>
13:22 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the LORD did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.<br>
13:23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.<br>
13:24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.<br>
13:25 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.<br>
<br>
13:26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, (and hath broken him,) and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.<br>
13:27 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.<br>
13:28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass (nor broken the ass).<br>
<br>
13:29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.<br>
13:30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!<br>
13:31 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:<br>
13:32 For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.<br>
13:33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Kings, chapters 12 and 13 -- NLT<br>
1 Kings, chapter 12 starting at verse 25, and we keep reading into the next chapter, reading all of chapter 13 this time, all 34 verses -- NLT<br>
<br>
25 Jeroboam then built up the city of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and it became his capital.<br>
Later he went and built up the town of Peniel (also known as, Penuel).<br>
<br>
26 Jeroboam thought to himself, "Unless I am careful, the kingdom will return to the dynasty of David.<br>
27 When these people go to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices at the Temple of the Lord, they will again give their allegiance to King Rehoboam of Judah. They will kill me and make him their king instead."<br>
<br>
28 So on the advice of his counsellors, the king made two gold calves. (He said to them,) He said to the people, "It is too much trouble for you to worship in Jerusalem. Look, Israel, these are the gods who brought you out of Egypt!"<br>
29 He placed these calf idols in Bethel and in Dan -- at either end of his kingdom.<br>
30 But this became a great sin, for the people worshiped the idols, travelling as far north as Dan to worship the one there.<br>
31 Jeroboam also erected buildings at the pagan shrines and ordained priests from the common people -- those who were not from the priestly tribe of Levi.<br>
<br>
(And Jeroboam instituted a religious festival in Bethel, held on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in imitation of the annual Festival of Shelters in Judah. This day of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late October or early November, exactly one month after the annual Festival of Shelters in Judah, which is talked about in Leviticus 23:34).<br>
<br>
32 And Jeroboam instituted a religious festival in Bethel, held on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in imitation of the annual Festival of Shelters in Judah. There at Bethel he himself offered sacrifices to the calves he had made, and he appointed priests for the pagan shrines he had made.<br>
33 So on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a day that he himself had designated, Jeroboam offered sacrifices on the altar at Bethel. He instituted a religious festival for Israel, and he went up to the altar to burn incense.<br>
1 At the Lord's command, a man of God from Judah went to Bethel, arriving there just as Jeroboam was approaching the altar to burn incense.<br>
2 Then at the Lord's command, he shouted, "O altar, altar! This is what the Lord says: A child named Josiah will be born into the dynasty of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests from the pagan shrines who come here to burn incense, and human bones will be burned on you."<br>
3 That same day the man of God gave a sign to prove his message. He said, "The Lord has promised to give this sign: This altar will split apart, and its ashes will be poured out on the ground."<br>
4 When King Jeroboam heard the man of God speaking against the altar at Bethel, he pointed at him and shouted, "Seize that man!" But instantly the king's hand became paralysed in that position, and he couldn't pull it back.<br>
5 At the same time a wide crack appeared in the altar, and the ashes poured out, just as the man of God had predicted in his message from the Lord.<br>
6 The king cried out to the man of God, "Please ask the Lord your God to restore my hand again!" So the man of God prayed to the Lord, and the king's hand was restored and he could move it again.<br>
7 Then the king said to the man of God, "Come to the palace with me and have something to eat, and I will give you a gift."<br>
8 But the man of God said to the king, "Even if you gave me half of everything you own, I would not go with you. I would not eat or drink anything in this place.<br>
9 For the Lord gave me this command: 'You must not eat or drink anything whilst you are there, and do not return to Judah by the same way you came.'"<br>
10 So he left Bethel and went home another way.<br>
<br>
11 As it happened, there was an old prophet living in Bethel, and his (son or) sons came home and told him what the man of God had done in Bethel that day. They also told their father what the man had said to the king.<br>
<br>
12 The old prophet asked them, "Which way did he go?"<br>
(They had seen which road the man of God had taken.)<br>
So they showed their father which road the man of God had taken.<br>
<br>
13 "Quick, saddle the donkey," the old man said. So they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it.<br>
14 Then he rode after the man of God and found him sitting under a great tree. The old prophet asked him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?"<br>
"Yes, I am," he replied.<br>
15 Then he said to the man of God, "Come home with me and eat some food."<br>
16 "No, I cannot," he replied. "I am not allowed to eat or drink anything here in this place.<br>
17 For the Lord gave me this command: 'You must not eat or drink anything whilst you are there, and do not return to Judah by the same way you came.'"<br>
18 But the old prophet answered, "I am a prophet, too, just as you are. And an angel gave me this command from the Lord: 'Bring him home with you so he can have something to eat and drink.'" But the old man was lying to him.<br>
19 So they went back together, and the man of God ate and drank at the prophet's home.<br>
20 Then whilst they were sitting at the table, a command from the Lord came to the old prophet.<br>
21 He cried out to the man of God from Judah, "This is what the Lord says: You have defied the word of the Lord and have disobeyed the command the Lord your God gave you.<br>
22 You came back to this place and ate and drank where he told you not to eat or drink. Because of this, your body will not be buried in the grave of your ancestors."<br>
23 After the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the old prophet saddled his own donkey for him,<br>
24 and the man of God started off again. But as he was travelling along, a lion came out and killed him. His body lay there on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it.<br>
25 People who passed by saw the body lying in the road and the lion standing beside it, and they went and reported it in Bethel, where the old prophet lived.<br>
26 When the prophet heard the report, he said, "It is the man of God who disobeyed the Lord's command. The Lord has fulfilled his word by causing the lion to attack and kill him."<br>
27 Then the prophet said to his sons, "Saddle a donkey for me." So they saddled a donkey,<br>
28 and he went out and found the body lying in the road. The donkey and lion were still standing there beside it, for the lion had not eaten the body nor attacked the donkey.<br>
29 So the prophet laid the body of the man of God on the donkey and took it back to the town to mourn over him and bury him.<br>
30 He laid the body in his own grave, crying out in grief, "Oh, my brother!"<br>
31 Afterward the prophet said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.<br>
32 For the message the Lord told him to proclaim against the altar in Bethel and against the pagan shrines in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true."<br>
33 But even after this, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil ways. He continued to choose priests from the common people. He appointed anyone who wanted to become a priest for the pagan shrines.<br>
34 This became a great sin and resulted in the utter destruction of Jeroboam's dynasty from the face of the earth.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Even though we might mess up and disobey, the Lord can still use us for great things, and we can still do great things for His glory and for His kingdom.<br>
Even though you might have messed up and made mistakes and disobeyed commandments in the past, the Lord can still use you for His glory and for His kingdom today, and in the future.<br>
In spite of what happened in the past, He can still use you in the present and in the future.<br>
He's more concerned about your future than your past.  That's why He did that work and finished that work in the past on the cross, before you were even born later on in the future.<br>
In the past, he fixed your future.<br>
<br>
From the time King Solomon's reign was done, and King Josiah started his reign later on, those two events could be about 291 years apart from each other, give or take a few decades.<br>
Back in Christian Essays 9, we read about how all of those predictions about that altar did come true approximately 250 to 300 years later.<br>
Here is a little snip from that study.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
2 Kings 23: 15-18<br>
15 The king (Josiah) also tore down the altar at Bethel -- the pagan shrine that Jeroboam son of Nebat had made when he caused Israel to sin. He burned down the shrine and ground it to dust, and he burned the Asherah pole.<br>
16 Then Josiah turned around and noticed several tombs in the side of the hill. He ordered that the bones be brought out, and he burned them on the altar at Bethel to desecrate it. (This happened just as the Lord had promised through the man of God when Jeroboam stood beside the altar at the festival.)<br>
Then Josiah turned and looked up at the tomb of the man of God who had predicted these things.<br>
<br>
17 "What is that monument over there?" Josiah asked.<br>
And the people of the town told him, "It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted the very things that you have just done to the altar at Bethel!"<br>
18 Josiah replied, "Leave it alone. Don't disturb his bones." So they did not burn his bones or those of the old prophet from Samaria.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3:8 (KJV)<br>
But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:17 (KJV)<br>
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 3: 11 & 12 KJV<br>
3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?<br>
3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 3: 11 & 12 NLT<br>
11 "Who told you that you were naked?" the Lord God asked. "Have you eaten from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat?"<br>
12 The man replied, "It was the woman you gave me who gave me the fruit, and I ate it."<br>
<br>
Commentary: Since a day is 1000 years, because of Adam's sin, mankind could not live longer than a day, which is 1000 years.<br>
You will then notice, after this point, that no one lived longer than 1000 years.<br>
<br>
And then, later on, the Lord knocks the setting down to 120 years, which is the setting that it's at today.<br>
Today, no one is allowed to live longer than 120 years, in your physical body, in this physical world.<br>

1 Samuel 15:24 (NLT)<br>
Then Saul admitted to Samuel, "Yes, I have sinned. I have disobeyed your instructions and the Lord's command, for I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
All of these people, King Solomon, and a man of God from Judah, and Adam, and King Saul, they all did the same sin.<br>
King Solomon decided to obey his many wives instead of obeying the Lord's commandment.<br>
A man of God from Judah obeyed some random stranger instead of obeying the Lord's commandment.<br>
Adam decided to obey Eve instead of obeying the Lord's commandment.<br>
Saul decided to obey the people around him instead of obeying the Lord's commandment.<br>
<br>
What about you?<br>
Are you a husband that decides to obey his wife instead of obeying the Lord's commandment?<br>
Are you a parent that decides to obey your child instead of obeying the Lord's commandment?<br>
Are you trying to do things for the Lord, but instead, you obey the demands of some random stranger, instead of obeying the Lord's commandment?<br>
Are you the leader of a church, of a city, of a state, of a nation, and you obey the demands of the people, and the demands of your secret brotherhood, instead of obeying the Lord's commandment?<br>
You'd better check yourself, before you wreck yourself.<br>

Ezekiel 11:5 -- TS2009<br>
And the Spirit of Yaw-Who-Wah fell upon me, and said to me, "Speak! 'Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, "Thus you have said, O house of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL). For I know what comes up in your spirit.<br>

<br>
Commentary:<br>
We have also studied parts of John 15 when we did the Bible study, titled,<br>
Fruitful, in Christian Essays 8,<br>
and we share many samples of John 15 in random areas towards the end of Christian Essays 11.<br>
We will read all of John 15 in the NLT in a random moment when we get to Christian Essays 32.<br>
The Book of John, chapters 14 and 15, is a very good place to read on a regular basis,<br>
as it contains a high concentration of many powerful Bible verses that connect<br>
His love and our successful relationship with the Father and the Son<br>
through faith, belief and Bible commandment obedience.<br>
The Bible is the law, and disobeying the Bible's commandments is the same thing as breaking the law!<br>
Receiving and believing in the work that the Son did for us on the cross gives us salvation and forgiveness,<br>
so that now we can have our joy be full in obeying Him, and living our lives for Him, instead of for our own self.<br>
<br>
Joshua 1:8 -- KJV<br>
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.<br>
<br>
Psalms 40:8 -- KJV<br>
I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.<br>

John 1:17 -- KJV<br>
For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.<br>

Part of Ezekiel 11:5 -- KJV<br>
...Thus saith the LORD...I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:13 (KJV)<br>
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:13 (NLT)<br>
Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he is the one to whom we are accountable.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:13 is quoting from the book of Enoch 9: verses 4 through 6. There are more than 40 quotes of Enoch in the New Testament.<br>
<br>
Here are two attempts to translate a passage from Enoch into English.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 9: verses 4 through 6 translated From The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament,<br>
The Ethiopic version of the book of Enoch<br>
by Robert Henry Charles,<br>
published by The Clarendon Press in 1906.<br>
Enoch 9: verses 4 through 6<br>
...Lord of the ages: 'Lord of lords, God of gods, King of kings, and God of the ages, the throne of Thy glory (standeth) unto all the generations of the<br>
5 ages, and Thy name holy and glorious and blessed unto all the ages! Thou hast made all things, and power over all things hast Thou: and all things are naked and open in Thy sight, and Thou seest all<br>
6 things, and nothing can hide itself from Thee....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 9: 4 & 5 -- Translated from the Ethiopic, by Rev. George H. Schodde, Ph. D. -- Professor at Capital University, in Columbus, Ohio.<br>
Published by Warren F. Draper in Andover, Massachusetts in 1882 with a second edition in 1911.<br>
Enoch 9: 4 & 5<br>
4. And they spoke to their Lord, to the King: 'O Lord of lords, God of gods, King of kings, the throne of thy majesty is among all the generations of the world, and thy name, holy and glorious, among all the generations of the world. Thou art blessed and praised!<br>
5. Thou hast made all things and all power is with thee, all things are open before thee and uncovered, and thou seest all things and nothing can hide itself from thee.<br>
<br>
In case you were wondering, it was also found in Enoch chapter 9 in the Eth Cepher.<br>
Sometimes, chapter numbers don't match up when looking at different English translations of the book of Enoch.<br>
They start to be off by one, especially somewhere around or after chapter 48.<br>
The Book of Enoch contains about 105 to 107 chapters. Different translators numbered some of the chapters slightly different, causing some chapter number locations to not be in agreement with different English translations.<br>
<br>
You'd better check yourself, before you wreck yourself, is a quote from a 1970's slogan from the Nationwide Safti-Break Centre which was later made famous in 1993 in Ice Cube's sexually-explicit rap song, Check Yo Self.<br>

<br>
A List of Needs<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 12:12<br>
Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Instant in prayer does not mean to walk away and pray about it later, or add someone to a prayer list.<br>
The Bible does not ever talk about having a prayer list or having a prayer team pray about it later.<br>
Think about what that means; Instant in prayer, as in pray instantly, without delay or postponement.<br>
Instantly, as in, pray about it right now, this very instant, immediately, or sooner.<br>
<br>
How do you fellowship?<br>
When we did our study on A Christian Church, back in Christian Essays 1, we studied the definition of fellowship.<br>
<br>
I cannot know what your needs are if you do not communicate those needs to me.<br>
How can I pray for you and look for ways to help you if you don't communicate to me what's going on in your life?<br>
We all have some part of our life that is not the way how we want it to be.<br>
It will always be like that for all of us, in one way or another, until we get to heaven.<br>
We all have some area of our life that is in need of prayer and is in need of help.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is how you do fellowship.<br>
You walk up to someone in your fellowship gathering meeting, and you say to him or her...<br>
Hi.  My name is (tell them your name), and could you pray for me?<br>
I need some prayer for... (and you think of one or two areas of your life that you really need help with, problems that you can't seem to get solved, et cetera)<br>
What could some of those things be?<br>
<br>
<br>
Grabbing material from Matthew 25, verses 29 through the end of the chapter, verse 46,<br>
and in Isaiah 58,<br>
From these two areas of Scripture, let's make a list of a person's needs.<br>
Original List...<br>
food<br>
water, drink<br>
place to sleep, spend the night, provide housing, hospitality, give shelter<br>
bring to your house the poor that are cast out<br>
bring to your house the poor that are afflicted<br>
provide clothing,<br>
sick, in hospital, health care, medical care<br>
in prison, mobility, transportation<br>
Free those who are wrongly imprisoned -- loose the bands of wickedness<br>
undo the heavy burdens<br>
lighten the burden of those who work for you.<br>
Let the oppressed go free,<br>
and remove the chains that bind people.<br>
help those in trouble.<br>
satisfy the afflicted soul<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's also come up with some questions that we can ask each other, to help us communicate and fellowship better.<br>
To help the people in your group become more involved in sharing and communicating their needs, here are some questions to think about or ask individuals, or even speak them out loud for consideration in a group setting.<br>
People can be a good resource.<br>
Is there anyone among us that might have some special knowledge, have access to resources, special skills, talent or some good and perfect giftings in helping or providing in any of these areas?<br>
<br>
<br>
Expanded List.<br>
Let's take the list and expand it out a bit.<br>
This is now a commentary, since we are now building upon what we found in the Bible.<br>
<br>
food -- Do you have enough food?  Can you store it, and keep it cold or frozen?<br>
Do you have a good can opener? Do you have dishes, pots, pans?<br>
Is it easy to keep the dishes clean?<br>
Can you heat the food and cook it easily?<br>
<br>
Can you store everything safely?<br>
Is everything that you have and are storing up and have all stocked up, is it all safe from extreme temperatures, moisture, mould, and mildew?<br>
Is it safe from thieves, insects, rodents and bears and wild animals and predators?<br>
If you are growing any food or have any animals or livestock, is it all healthy, safe and protected?<br>
Does the agricultural food, animals or livestock all appear to be healthy? Are they all safe from thieves, insects, rodents and bears and wild animals and predators?<br>
When was the last time your carefully examined your fence from end to end?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Are your utilities all paid up?<br>
Do you need help with paying the electric bill, gas, water and sewer bill?<br>
Is your bill paid for the trash collection?<br>
Do you need fuel for heat?<br>
Do you need firewood for heating and cooking?<br>
Should you be concerned about a fire for heat consuming the oxygen in your sleeping area, and posing a risk of death from carbon monoxide poisoning?<br>

<br>
Free those who are wrongly imprisoned -- loose the bands of wickedness --<br>
Are there any addictions that are trying to have a stronghold on you, that you want to be set free from?<br>
You can be vague about the addiction.  The Lord Yaw-Who-Wah knows all about what it is, and he came here to set us free from all addictions, and enslavements.<br>
<br>
Can you help someone...<br>
undo the heavy burdens --<br>
lighten the burden of those who work for you. --<br>
Let the oppressed go free, --<br>
and remove the chains that bind people. --<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, show us what we can do to help people that are bound up, depressed and oppressed,<br>
bless us and provide for us, with finances, and fellowships, because you know that we have needs,<br>
guide us and direct us according to your will and according to your good wisdom from above,<br>
in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 4 tells us that, when Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures.<br>
The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the Greek version of Isaiah 61: verses 1 & 2, followed by Isaiah 58:6.<br>
Here He tells us some of the reasons why He came here, why He died on the cross and why He was resurrected from the grave.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 61: 1-3 KJV<br>
1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;<br>
2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;<br>
3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 61: 1-3 NLT<br>
1<br>
The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon me,<br>
for the Lord has anointed me<br>
to bring good news to the poor.<br>
He has sent me to comfort the brokenhearted<br>
and to proclaim that captives will be released<br>
and prisoners will be freed (and the blind will see).<br>
2<br>
He has sent me to tell those who mourn<br>
that the time of the Lord's favour has come (to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord).<br>
and with it, the day of God's anger against their enemies.<br>
3<br>
To all who mourn in Israel (in Zion).<br>
he will give a crown of beauty for ashes,<br>
a joyous blessing instead of mourning,<br>
festive praise instead of despair.<br>
In their righteousness, they will be like great oaks<br>
that the Lord has planted for his own glory.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 58:6 (KJV)<br>
Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?<br>
<br>
Isaiah 58:6 (NLT)<br>
"No, this is the kind of fasting I want: Free those who are wrongly imprisoned; lighten the burden of those who work for you. Let the oppressed go free, and remove the chains that bind people.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Can you help someone in these areas?<br>
Even if you don't have the money to give them, and even if you don't have the time to be with them, we can at least pray for them.<br>
Never underestimate the power of interceding with intercessory prayer.<br>
<br>
Romans 8:26 (KJV)<br>
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6:18 (NLT)<br>
Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2:1 (NLT)<br>
I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 7:25 (NLT)<br>
Therefore he (Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw) is able, once and forever, to save those who come to God through him. He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf.<br>
<br>
The NLT of Isaiah 53:12 is talking about Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, but maybe it's also talking about us, and what many of us have also gone through.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 53:12 (NLT)<br>
I will give him the honours of a victorious soldier, because he exposed himself to death. He was counted among the rebels. He bore the sins of many and interceded for rebels.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: When your body dies, all of your earthly wealth, all of your real estate, your property, your vehicles, your money, your possessions, and your physical objects that you own, all of your college degrees and certifications, you will instantly lose all of that forever when your body dies.<br>
You never see a U-Haul being towed behind a hearse (that's the vehicle used for transporting a coffin to a funeral).<br>
<br>
Earthly wealth can go down in value as time goes by, thieves can steal it, it can become old, worn-out and deteriorated,  moths can make holes in clothing, metals can rust, and even if you can preserve it, when your body dies, you instantly lose it anyway.<br>
<br>
How can you have wealth and treasure that lasts forever? You can't take it with you, but you can send it on up ahead of you. You can accumulate and build-up wealth, rewards and treasure in heaven that will be yours forever, it never gets old, it never loses its value over time, moths and rust and deterioration will never happen there, and no one will ever steal it or take it away from you.<br>
<br>
How do you accumulate and build-up wealth, rewards and treasure in heaven? Love others, give your money and wealth to others, and help other people with their List of Needs. You can't help someone if you don't fellowship with them and communicate with them to find out what their needs are.<br>
<br>
If you can't give them money, can you give them something?  Extra food? Read this List of Needs again.<br>
<br>
If you can't give them money or anything, can you give them some of your time?  Spend time with them and look for ways to help them.<br>
Even if you just sit with them and talk with them, and show yourself to be friendly.<br>
<br>
If you can't give them anything, and you can't spend time with them, you can still lift up intercessory prayers for them.<br>
Pray for their needs.<br>
<br>
Use this List of Needs as a guide. Store up treasure for yourself in heaven by selling your possessions and give to those in need.<br>
This is a New Testament commandment, given to us by God, delivered to us directly out of the spoken, quoted words of Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 33 and 34 -- NLT<br>
33 "Sell your possessions and give to those in need. This will store up treasure for you in heaven! And the purses of heaven never get old or develop holes. Your treasure will be safe; no thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it.<br>
34 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 32-38 -- KJV<br>
12:32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.<br>
12:33 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.<br>
12:34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<br>
12:35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;<br>
12:36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.<br>
12:37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.<br>
12:38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.<br>
<br>
Luke Chapter 12 is quoting the words of Jesus, as Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, gives a Teaching about Money and Possessions.<br>
Then Jesus tells us to Be Ready for the Lord's Coming.<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 29-38 -- NLT<br>
29 "And don't be concerned about what to eat and what to drink. Don't worry about such things.<br>
30 These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers all over the world, but your Father already knows your needs.<br>
31 Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and he will give you everything you need.<br>
32 "So don't be afraid, little flock. For it gives your Father great happiness to give you the Kingdom.<br>
33 "Sell your possessions and give to those in need. This will store up treasure for you in heaven! And the purses of heaven never get old or develop holes. Your treasure will be safe; no thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it.<br>
34 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.<br>
35 "Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning,<br>
36 as though you were waiting for your master to return from the wedding feast. Then you will be ready to open the door and let him in the moment he arrives and knocks.<br>
37 The servants who are ready and waiting for his return will be rewarded. I tell you the truth, he himself will seat them, put on an apron, and serve them as they sit and eat!<br>
<br>
(He may come in the second or third watch, which would be in the middle of the night or just before dawn.)<br>
38 He may come in the middle of the night or just before dawn. But whenever he comes, he will reward the servants who are ready.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, finishing up the list, and finishing this little Bible study,<br>
help those in trouble. --<br>
satisfy the afflicted soul --<br>
Tell me about the troubles that you are having.<br>
Can I just spend some time with you?<br>
Look for ways to help one another.<br>
Go to their house, do some laundry, bring a meal, cook a meal, wash some dishes, mow the lawn, fix the computer, fix the car, learn about them, listen carefully, watch, pray, minister, love, forgive.<br>

<a name="JAH27PRAY4PARTSBCCBPT"></a><h2>A Prayer in Four Parts</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
A Prayer in Four Parts<br>
<br>
This is a Bible study that has a Big Prayer at the end, which contains four parts to it.<br>
The four parts that we will pray about later, are...<br>
being Bored, Course Correction, Bad Programming, and Technicalities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:16 (KJV)<br>
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<br>
<br>
Luke 6:27 (KJV)<br>
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,<br>
<br>
Luke 6:28 (KJV)<br>
bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 12:14 (KJV)<br>
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.<br>
<br>
A portion selected from Matthew 5:44 (KJV)<br>
...bless them that curse you....<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is all of Matthew 5:44 (KJV)<br>
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;<br>
<br>
Psalms 18:3 (KJV)<br>
I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:11 (KJV)<br>
Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 54:17 (KJV)<br>
No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgement thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4: 17-18 -- KJV<br>
4:17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,<br>
4:18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:<br>
(because of the hardness of their heart:)<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28: 13 & 14 -- KJV<br>
28:13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.<br>
28:14 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Looking at those two passages that we were just in just now, if we put Ephesians 4:18 and Proverbs 28:14 together,<br>
We can say, trying to walk like everyone else, like the nations, in the vanity of their mind, will cause you to be alienated from the life of God, because of the hardness of your heart.<br>
He that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.<br>
Confess your sins and forsake your sins and you shall have mercy and grace to help in time of need.<br>
Hardening your heart will cause you to fall into mischief, and it will also push you away from the life that God wants you to have.<br>
Whosoever shall confess that Yaw-Who-Shaw is the Son of ELL-Low-Heem, ELL-Low-Heem dwells in him or her, and he or she dwells in ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 5:16 -- KJV<br>
Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.<br>
<br>
1 John 1:9 -- KJV<br>
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
<br>
1 John 4:15 -- KJV<br>
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's go back to Ephesians 4 again and read a little bit more of that area.<br>
Ephesians 4: 17-24 -- KJV<br>
4:17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,<br>
<br>
4:18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:<br>
(because of the hardness of their heart:)<br>
4:19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.<br>
4:20 But ye have not so learned Christ;<br>
4:21 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:<br>
4:22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;<br>
4:23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;<br>
4:24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.<br>
(which after God is created in righteousness and holiness of truth.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 6:13 (KJV)<br>
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 10: 13 & 14 (KJV)<br>
10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.<br>
10:14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.<br>
<br>
<br>
We just read this next verse a moment ago. Think carefully about this verse again.<br>
Ephesians 4:23 -- KJV<br>
4:23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;<br>
<br>
And now look at this part of this verse here,<br>
Romans 12:2 -- KJV<br>
...but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind....<br>
<br>
be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and be transformed by the renewing of your mind.<br>
<br>
Here is all of Romans 12:2 -- KJV<br>
12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 15: 33 & 34 -- KJV<br>
15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.<br>
15:34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not....<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 14:13 -- KJV<br>
14:13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling-block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.<br>
<br>
Revelation 4:11 (KJV)<br>
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.<br>
<br>
Revelation 4:11  -- NLT: "You are worthy, O Lord our God,<br>
to receive glory and honour and power.<br>
For you created all things,<br>
and they exist because you created what you pleased."<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:13 (KJV)<br>
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:13 -- NLT:<br>
For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's send up some prayers right now. In English, I would call upon the name of the Lord, Jesus.  In Hebrew that would be me calling upon the name of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
This part of my prayer is a prayer about being Bored.<br>
I remember a child actress that was in a popular TV series.  When the series eventually ended, which was when she was at the age of 14, she became depressed and started drinking alcohol and dabbling into drugs and such, because her sense and her foundation of her value and importance rested upon her identity of her fictional character in the TV series. The character was fictional.  The person that she played in that TV series did not actually exist, and that fake person was invented and controlled by the imagination of worldly TV show writers. So, she started heavy drinking and pill popping. Somebody asked her, why did you start doing this?  Her answer?  She simply said, I was bored.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, sometimes I look at myself and my life, and I feel stuck, trapped, and bored. Running this race, this race course can feel kind of dry and boring.  I feel tempted to run off the race course, just to see what would happen and what it would look like and feel like, looking for distractions, entertainment, stimulation, something that will make me feel like I'm having fun, something, someone or someplace that will make me laugh and be amused, or inspired or invigorated or stimulated. Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, I am here to give you pleasure, not to give myself pleasure, and I am here for your glory, for your purposes, to carry out your plans and I am here for your kingdom. I am set apart for these special and precious purposes. Please help me run the race, get in and stay in the race and stay on course, with purpose, with focus, and determination, persistence and integrity, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's glorious, majestic name, Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This part of my prayer is a prayer about Course Correction.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, you are my Heavenly Father, you are the perfect Father, and, the dad that I wished that I would have had, you are that dad that loves me with an everlasting love, and nothing can ever separate your love from me. When a good father sees his child going off course, or starting to be disobedient, he begins with giving, teaching, and dispensing into that child, wisdom, guidance, understanding, piloting, guiding and directing that child, to help the child get back on course, going down the path and the way that he or she should go, and when they get older, they will stay on course and remain upon the path, the way they should and must go, the truth that they must follow and the life, the eternal life. Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw is the way, the truth, and the life. Yaw-Who-Shaw is the Bible, the Torah. The Bible, the Torah, is the way, the truth, and the life.<br>
<br>
If a child goes off course, either by accident or on purpose, by rebellion and disobedience and a dabbling into the spirit of lawlessness, directing and teaching has to become correction, discipline and punishment. When a good father detects that it is needed, he will carefully and lovingly administer correction, discipline and punishment. If I'm running a race on a race course, and I get off track, there needs to be a  course correction to repent and change direction to get back on track and get back onto the course so that I can continue running the race with patience, so I can receive the prize of salvation, forgiveness, perfection and everlasting life.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, I really do not like the idea of having to receive correction, discipline and punishment. I would rather be smart enough and obedient enough to just follow you, listen to you, trust you and obey you and your leading, teaching, guiding, piloting, driving, and directing, rather than having to be forcefully controlled and shoved around like a senseless animal that has to have a bit and bridle, a lead, a leash, a harness and a choke collar just to keep it under control. Please help me have integrity and wisdom, and a responsive, disciplined heart that just does the right thing the first time around. I will not need a course correction if I just would stay on course to begin with, with my heart, mind, soul, memories, desires and imaginations being kept careful and stable. Integrity is doing the right thing even when nobody else is looking. But, you are the God who Sees, and you would see me do it even if nobody else sees me do it. Moses taught me something. If you have to look left and right to see if anybody is about to see what you are going to do next, then, maybe you should not do it. Maybe that is the Holy Spirit telling you not to do it. Help us all stay on course with a heart, mind and soul of integrity and obedience, so that we can joyfully learn, obey and follow your good leading, teaching, guiding, piloting, driving, and directing, and may we continually receive your good wisdom from above, but if I have to, I am also thankful for your necessary correction, discipline and punishment, because you love us and you do not want us to get off course.  Help me stay on course to begin with, so that I will faithfully  stay on course, with purpose, with focus, and determination, persistence and integrity, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's glorious, majestic name, Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This part of my prayer is a prayer about Bad Programming.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, when victims of sexual abuse talk about that time in the past when the abuse started, one thing they may mention is how the abuser made them think that it is good, that it feels good, that it is a form of pleasure, and that, by doing those activities, they are being loved, they are giving and receiving love, and that it made them feel like they are loved and that they are valuable and important. He gave me attention, he spent time with me, he made me feel special and valuable, like I was important to him, and that is the way how he loved me.  And so, the victim, being deceived, will usually say, I liked it.  Later on, when they eventually learn the truth about it, they are left with very severe damages and injuries, mentally, emotionally and spiritually, that can have a very lasting or permanent impact on their relationships and families.<br>
<br>
I once was at the grocery store, and I was in the queue at the till, waiting to pay for my food, and I happen to see a little girl walk into the store.  She was about 8 or 9 years old.  It was obvious that she was a girl that had not yet started puberty, and yet, as soon as she entered the store, she scanned the room, looking for any man, and then she would look and stare at every man she saw, with a longing look of lust, as though she was trying to transmit and infect a spirit of lust, adultery and sexual immorality into every man she saw, even the older men in the store that are 30, 40, or even 50 years older than her. Where did she learn to look at men like that, and desire old men like that? My guess would be that she had received bad programming, from someone that abused her, or from porn on the internet, or from other kids sending and receiving messages and images on social media, or from public schools, TV, online streaming videos, porn websites, movies and sexual rap music.<br>
<br>
How many more children have received this bad programming and are trying to infect others with this same disease of sin? They don't even know that they are sick, and that they are trying to make others sick. I've seen kids like this, abused like that, and within minutes of being around them, they start to transmit and communicate, verbally or non-verbally, directly or indirectly, the sexual immorality that is installed and running on their operating system, from receiving bad programming. The infected children with the bad programming are trying to infect anyone else, young or old, with their virus of sexual immorality, because they do not even know that it is bad, wrong, harmful and destructive to who they are now, and the future possible marriage or relationships that they want to have in the future.<br>
<br>
Bad Programming is like installing a virus or some form of malware on a computer, or installing a virus or bad app on a phone.  I'm trying to run a race and this is slowing me down, it's weighing me down, trying to make me go off course, off track.  The bad app or virus is making my computer think and process things that I don't want it to, it is a disease that is passed around in all sorts of ways. I even was just happening to hear on a random FM radio station, I was not even on the station for 10 seconds when a rap song with the f-word was spoken and broadcasted on the FM radio, and that is probably so ordinary these days, that no one even cares about hearing f-bombs on FM radio or the explicit sexual instructions that they are singing and rapping to any child that can operate a simple FM radio anywhere.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, set us free from toxic people, poisonous people, those that try to imprison us, suffocate us, restrict us and infect us with lies and deceptions of bad programming, set us free and give us freedom from those people, and be our antidote that neutralises and cancels all of the poisonous effects and poisonous ways of thinking that we might have had from them.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, by the power and authority of your name, rebuke and cast out, all witches, all wizards, all of those practising satanic rituals and magical arts, and rebuke and cast out all of their curses, hexes, spells, incantations, alchemies, and take away all of their power and authority so that their attempts to attack us will have no effect, and may it all backfire upon them tenfold, and that you would put a permanent end to all of their attacks, curses, spells, and quarrellings, arguments, separation attempts, division attempts, divorce attempts, and that they would never again be able to cause any discord, strife or contention or divisions or separations from, with or between fellow Torah fellowship believers. Help us have discernment and be able to detect, deflect and keep away any people that try to sneak in as wolves in sheep's clothing. Do not allow them into our property or into our community or fellowship gatherings.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, we all have been exposed to this disease, this virus of sin, this bad programming, and so we have people that think that they are ugly or not valuable if they don't wear that make-up or appear sexy with that certain kind of tight, low-cut, revealing or immodest clothing, and that if they are not being noticed for their sexuality, then they are not loved, valued and appreciated. I know I could spend another whole hour coming up with 100 more paragraphs about this problem, but I would rather just pray to you, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the one who can heal, fix, repair, remove, rebuke and cast out of us, this bad programming, and please replace it with good programming, and install into us, into our operating system, into our minds, hearts, souls, our feelings, attitudes, our memories, our past, our present, our future and into our imaginations, healing and casting out, followed by controls, protections and shields, like installing an anti-virus software app on our computer or phone, to remove now, and then stop and protect future spiritual attacks and future infection attempts, and attempts to install and run these bad apps, these forms of bad programming, so I will not be slowed down, or weighed down, so I can have the integrity to keep running the race with patience, and faithfully stay on course, with purpose, with focus, and determination, persistence and integrity, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's glorious, majestic name, Ah-Main.<br>

This part of my prayer is a prayer about Technicalities.<br>
I have told this story before, and allow me to tell you this parable again. Let's say that, I go to a school, and I happen to see a 5-year-old girl pretending to be a doctor. She has a pretend white lab coat on, the same kind a doctor or hospital worker might wear, and a toy stethoscope, and some other pretend doctor and medical things that you might see at a doctor's office or hospital examination room, all inside her doctor's medical bag.  She says to me with a big smile, when I grow up I want to be a doctor!<br>
<br>
And so I point to an area at the top of my arm, next to my head, and I ask her, what is this called?  She says, that is your shoulder. And then I say to her, that is wrong! You are incorrect, and I am very offended that you call that a shoulder!  This exact spot right here is called, the clavicle, and that is the medically correct term for this particular area that you call a shoulder. How can you call yourself a doctor when you don't even know the how to pronounce the correct names?  And so, she runs away, crying, and decides to never be a doctor because of how mean and cruel I was to her, even though I was technically correct in calling that the clavicle and not a shoulder.  We need to be sensitive and supportive to those that don't know what we know at this point of their life, and we need to encourage people to keep learning and growing in their knowledge of the person that they want to become.<br>
<br>
Are you like that with people?  Are you mean and cruel to those that don't know what you know?  You're not? Are you sure?  Let me tell the story again, and I will change a few things, and let's see what happens here.<br>
<br>
Let's say that, I go to a church, and I happen to see a 5-year-old girl pretending to read a children's Bible. She has a neat Bible with pictures in it, and she has next to her some pictures that she coloured that illustrate stories in the Bible, and her Bible bookmark has a Christian cross on it with John 3:16 quoted on it.  She says to me with a big smile, when I die, I'm going to live forever in the kingdom of heaven! Jesus is the king and he lives in my heart!<br>
<br>
And so I point to her bookmark, and I read part of John 3:16, For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son. I ask her, what is the name of the only begotten Son?  She says, Jesus. And then I say to her, that is wrong! You are incorrect, and I am very offended that you call the only begotten Son Jesus!  His correct name is pronounced Yaw-Who-Shaw. How can you call yourself a saved, believing Christian going to heaven when you don't even know the how to pronounce the correct names?  And so, she runs away, crying, and decides to never read her Bible or go to church ever again because of how mean and cruel I was to her, even though I was technically correct in calling the only begotten Son Yaw-Who-Shaw and not Jesus.  We need to be sensitive and supportive to those that don't know what we know at this point of their life, and we need to encourage people to keep learning and growing in their knowledge of the Bible and in their development and strengthening of their marriage relationship with the Heavenly Father, and his only begotten Son and in the Spirit that is Holy, his Sevenfold Spirit, so that people can walk even more deeply, strongly and intimately in the way they need to go, in the truth that they need to believe and receive, and in the eternal, everlasting life that they need in order to live, forever.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 13:8 -- KJV<br>
Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 13:8 -- NLT<br>
Prophecy and speaking in unknown languages and special knowledge will become useless. But love will last forever!<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 14 KJV -- verse 9, verse 13 and verse 19<br>
9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.<br>
13 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.<br>
19 Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT of 1 Corinthians 14 -- verse 9 and verse 19<br>
9 It's the same for you. If you speak to people in words they don't understand, how will they know what you are saying? You might as well be talking into empty space.<br>
19 But in a church meeting I would rather speak five understandable words to help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, we live in an English country, surrounded by English people that only have easy access to English Bibles, and only know of your name as it is known in the English language. To them, Hebrew is an unknown tongue, an unknown language, and the Bible warns us not to speak in unknown languages without any interpretation. I'm thankful that we can know you in a deeper and more intimate level by calling on your actual, true Hebrew name, and that you have revealed yourself to us in a clearer and more in-depth way, by showing us more of the truth about what has happened to your word as it was copied and translated throughout the centuries of time, and we love how you are showing us again additional books that were taken away from us in previous centuries, but now, we need your help in loving others around us who don't know you very well. They may have an obvious amount of sin and lawlessness, and we see that sin all around us, but you say to us, I'm holding you to a higher standard because you are actually studying Torah and they are not, so since you know and study Torah, I expect you to follow Torah and obey it, even if everyone else around you does not.<br>
<br>
When we detect these technical mistakes, these technicalities, sometimes we stop at the technical mistake and we do not receive the message, the meaning and the teaching of the communication. It's like, if I get a text in the middle of the night that says, Yor howse is on fyre git out noww!! -- Instead of responding and acting upon the message, I text back and say, you misspelled the word, house, it is not spelled h o w s e, and the word fire is spelled wrong -- it is supposed to be spelled, f i  r e and not f y r e, and by the time you send that, those extra seconds you spent doing that could cost you your life. I mean, did you look beyond the immediate, and pull out the message that was behind all of those technical mistakes? Your house is on fire, get out now! Did you actually get the message? In that example, the person is not receiving the message because he or she is tripping and stumbling on the technical mistakes. Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, we need wisdom and knowledge on how to pull out the teachings, the learnings, the messages and the meanings that are within even the most basic English Bible translations. We might be in situations where we only have the English Bibles nearby, and we need to communicate your word and your truth and your Torah in the kind of way that encourages and helps others get closer to you and have a better and more obedient relationship with you, our friend and our saviour who sits on the throne forever and ever.<br>
<br>
Help us love others, help us forgive others, for they know not what they do, and help us encourage other believers who may only know about you in the English language with only English names, so that we can help others off track get back in the race, and not be slowed down, or weighed down, so we can all help build each other up so that all believers everywhere can have the integrity to keep running the race with patience, and faithfully stay on course, with purpose, with focus, and determination, persistence and integrity, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's glorious, majestic name, Ah-Main.<br>
