Nehemiah 9: 5-15 -- KJV<br>
...Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.<br>
9:6 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.<br>
9:7 Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;<br>
9:8 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:<br>
9:9 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;<br>
9:10 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.<br>
9:11 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.<br>
9:12 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.<br>
9:13 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven,<br>
and gavest them right judgements, (and laws of truth,) and true laws, good statutes and commandments:<br>
9:14 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:<br>
9:15 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.<br>
(and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst lift up thine hand to give them.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 9: 5-15 -- NLT<br>
"Stand up and praise the Lord your God, for he lives from everlasting to everlasting!" Then they prayed:<br>
"May your glorious name be praised! May it be exalted above all blessing and praise!<br>
6 "You alone are the Lord. You made the skies and the heavens and all the stars. You made the earth and the seas and everything in them. You preserve them all, and the angels of heaven worship you.<br>
7 "You are the Lord God, who chose Abram and brought him from Ur of the Chaldeans and renamed him Abraham.<br>
8 When he had proved himself faithful, you made a covenant with him to give him and his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites. And you have done what you promised, for you are always true to your word.<br>
9 "You saw the misery of our ancestors in Egypt, and you heard their cries from beside the Red Sea (also known as the sea of reeds).<br>
10 You displayed miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh, his officials, and all his people, for you knew how arrogantly they were treating our ancestors. You have a glorious reputation that has never been forgotten.<br>
11 You divided the sea for your people so they could walk through on dry land! And then you hurled their enemies into the depths of the sea. They sank like stones beneath the mighty waters.<br>
12 You led our ancestors by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night so that they could find their way.<br>
13 "You came down at Mount Sinai and spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and instructions that were just, and decrees and commands that were good.<br>
14 You instructed them concerning your holy Sabbath. And you commanded them, through Moses your servant, to obey all your commands, decrees, and instructions.<br>
15 "You gave them bread from heaven when they were hungry and water from the rock when they were thirsty. You commanded them to go and take possession of the land you had sworn to give them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Elohim is the word, God, in Hebrew. It is pronounced, EE-Low-Heem, or, EL-Low-Heem.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah is the name of the Lord, the Heavenly Father's actual name in the ancient Hebrew language.<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 9: 5-15 -- TS2009<br>
"Rise, bless Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim forever and ever! And let them bless Your esteemed Name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise!<br>
6 "You are Yaw-Who-Wah, You alone. You have made the heavens, the heavens of the heavens, with all their host, the earth and all that are on it, the seas and all that are in them, and You give life to them all. And the host of the heavens are bowing themselves to You.<br>
7 "You are Yaw-Who-Wah, the Elohim who chose Abram, and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham,<br>
8 and found his heart trustworthy before You, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Kena'anites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites – to give it to his seed. And You have established Your words, for You are righteous,<br>
9 and saw the affliction of our fathers in Mitsrayim (Egypt), and heard their cry by the Sea of Reeds,<br>
10 and gave signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land. For You knew that they acted proudly against them. And You made a Name for Yourself, as it is this day.<br>
11 "And You split the sea before them, and they passed over into the midst of the sea on the dry land. And their pursuers You threw into the deep as a stone into the mighty waters.<br>
12 "And You led them by day with a cloudy column, and by night with a column of fire, to give them light in the way they were to go.<br>
13 "And You came down on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from the heavens, and gave them straight right-rulings and Torot of truth, good laws and commands.<br>
(and gave them straight right-rulings and Torot of truth, -- Torot is the plural of Torah, teaching, good laws and commands, laws of truth, as the truth in the law.)<br>
14 "And You made known to them Your set-apart Sabbath, and You commanded them commands and laws and Torot, by the hand of (Moses) Mosheh (Moe-Shay) Your servant.<br>
15 "And You gave them bread from the heavens for their hunger, and brought them water out of the rock for their thirst, and said to them to go in to possess the land which You had sworn to give them.<br>

Commentary:<br>
The spiritual does not always mix well with the physical, and can cause a sour tummy.<br>
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak, so if you think you have the stomach for these spiritual matters, then this Bible study is for you.<br>
Here again are some Bible verses that talk about how, we need to take, the Old Testament, the New Testament, the old covenant, the new covenant, the Rock, the Bible, the commandments, the Scriptures, the Law, the set of instructions, the Torah, and let it all enter into us, into you, and into me.<br>
We need to take the Torah, and let it enter into us, and when we do, it will be enjoyable, and it will taste good, like eating sweet honey, but it can be sometimes difficult to digest and process and understand.<br>
We taste and eat and trust and obey Torah even if we don't understand why.<br>
Even if you know it's going to give you a sour stomach, eat it anyway.<br>
Some nutritional supplements may cause varying amounts of digestion difficulties, but we know we eventually need those nutritional results and benefits anyway.<br>
Sometimes, Torah is hard to understand.<br>
Eat it anyway. Study, trust and obey Torah anyway, even if you don't understand why sometimes.<br>
Sometimes, Torah is not very happy, with warnings, lamentations, mourning, woe, funeral songs, words of sorrow, and pronouncements of doom.<br>
Eat it anyway. Study, trust and obey Torah anyway, even if it is not happy or fun to read sometimes.<br>
We will see two examples of someone eating a scroll or book.<br>
If this book, this scroll, could possibly be a symbol or representation of the commandments in the Bible, the Torah, then maybe this thought could be true.<br>
If that is the case, and if the scroll or book was Torah, then here is something to think about.<br>
In one example, we will see that the scroll or book, Torah, can be upsetting to digest or process or understand as it enters into you and becomes one with you after eating it.<br>
In the other example, the words written on the scroll or book are upsetting or difficult to process or digest as they enter into your eyes as you read it.<br>
In one example, it enters in through your eyes, and in the other, it enters in through your mouth.<br>
Interesting. Fixing your eyes on him, confessing with your mouth, taste and see, mouth and eyes, taste and see that Torah is good.<br>
Gold is pretty good on the eyes, and honey is good on the tongue.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 19:9-11 (NLT)<br>
9<br>
Reverence for the Lord is pure,<br>
lasting forever.<br>
The laws of the Lord are true;<br>
each one is fair.<br>
10<br>
They are more desirable than gold,<br>
even the finest gold.<br>
They are sweeter than honey,<br>
even honey dripping from the comb.<br>
11<br>
They are a warning to your servant,<br>
a great reward for those who obey them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 19:7-11 (KJV)<br>
(The doctrine of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul:)<br>
19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.<br>
19:8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.<br>
19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgements of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.<br>
(the judgements of the LORD are truth and righteous altogether.)<br>
19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.<br>
(and the dropping of honeycombs.)<br>
19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 19:7-14 (going to the end of Psalms 19)  (TS2009)<br>
7 The Torah of Yaw-Who-Wah is perfect, bringing back the being; The witness of Yaw-Who-Wah is trustworthy, making wise the simple;<br>
8 The orders of Yaw-Who-Wah are straight, rejoicing the heart; The command of Yaw-Who-Wah is clear, enlightening the eyes;<br>
9 The fear of Yaw-Who-Wah is clean, standing forever; The right-rulings of Yaw-Who-Wah are true, They are righteous altogether,<br>
10 More desirable than gold, Than much fine gold; And sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<br>
11 Also, Your servant is warned by them, In guarding them there is great reward.<br>
12 Who discerns mistakes? Declare me innocent from those that are secret,<br>
13 Also keep Your servant back from presumptuous ones, Do not let them rule over me. Then shall I be perfect, and innocent of great transgression.<br>
14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be pleasing before You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, my rock and my redeemer.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:101 (TS2009)<br>
I have restrained my feet from every evil way, That I might guard Your word.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119: 101-104 (NLT)<br>
101<br>
I have refused to walk on any evil path,<br>
so that I may remain obedient to your word.<br>
102<br>
I haven't turned away from your regulations,<br>
for you have taught me well.<br>
103<br>
How sweet your words taste to me;<br>
they are sweeter than honey.<br>
104<br>
Your commandments give me understanding;<br>
no wonder I hate every false way of life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119: 101-105 (KJV)<br>
119:101	I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.<br>
119:102	I have not departed from thy judgements: for thou hast taught me.<br>
(How sweet are thy words unto my palate!)<br>
119:103	How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!<br>
119:104	Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.<br>
(Thy word is a candle unto my feet, and a light unto my path.)<br>
119:105	Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34:8 (NLT)<br>
Taste and see that the Lord is good. Oh, the joys of those who take refuge in him!<br>
<br>

34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.<br>

Tet Oh, taste and see that Yaw-Who-Wah is good; Blessed is the man that takes refuge in Him!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 81: verses 13 and 16 (KJV)<br>
81:13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!<br>
(He should have fed them also with the fat of wheat)<br>
81:16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 81: verses 13 and 16 (TS2009)<br>
13 "O, if My people had listened to Me, Yis-Rye-ELL would walk in My ways,<br>
16 He would feed them with the finest of wheat; And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 81: 13 through 16 (NLT)<br>
13<br>
Oh, that my people would listen to me!<br>
Oh, that Israel would follow me, walking in my paths!<br>
14<br>
How quickly I would then subdue their enemies!<br>
How soon my hands would be upon their foes!<br>
15<br>
Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him;<br>
they would be doomed forever.<br>
16<br>
But I would feed you with the finest wheat.<br>
I would satisfy you with wild honey from the rock."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 32: 12 & 13 (NLT)<br>
12<br>
The Lord alone guided them;<br>
they followed no foreign gods.<br>
13<br>
He let them ride over the highlands<br>
and feast on the crops of the fields.<br>
He nourished them with honey from the rock<br>
and olive oil from the stony ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 32: 12 & 13 (KJV)<br>
32:12 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.<br>
32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 32: 11-13 (TS2009)<br>
11 "As an eagle stirs up its nest, Flutters over its young, Spreading out its wings, taking them up, Bearing them on its wings.<br>
12 "Yaw-Who-Wah alone led him, And there was no strange mighty one with him.<br>
13 "He made him ride in the heights of the earth, And he ate the fruit of the fields, And He made him to draw honey from the rock, And oil from the flinty rock,<br>
<br>

<br>
Ezekiel 2:6, and we will keep reading into Ezekiel 3, stopping at verse 4 -- KJV<br>
2:6 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though (rebels and) briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.<br>
2:7 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear:<br>
for they are most rebellious.<br>
(for they are most rebellion.)<br>
2:8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.<br>
2:9 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;<br>
2:10 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.<br>
3:1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.<br>
3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.<br>
3:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.<br>	 		 
3:4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 2:6, and we will keep reading into Ezekiel 3, stopping at verse 4 -- NLT<br>
6 "Son of man, do not fear them or their words. Don't be afraid even though their threats surround you like nettles and briers and stinging scorpions. Do not be dismayed by their dark scowls, even though they are rebels. <br>
7 You must give them my messages whether they listen or not. But they won't listen, for they are completely rebellious! <br>
8 Son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not join them in their rebellion. Open your mouth, and eat what I give you."<br>
9 Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me. It held a scroll,<br>
10 which he unrolled. And I saw that both sides were covered with funeral songs, words of sorrow, and pronouncements of doom.<br>
1 The voice said to me, "Son of man, eat what I am giving you -- eat this scroll! Then go and give its message to the people of Israel."<br>
2 So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll.<br>
3 "Fill your stomach with this," he said. And when I ate it, it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.<br>
4 Then he said, "Son of man, go to the people of Israel and give them my messages.<br>
<br>
<br>
Israel, in the Hebrew language, is pronounced, Yis-Rye-ELL.<br>
The Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, is speaking to Ezekiel, calling Ezekiel, son of man.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 2:6, and we will keep reading into Ezekiel 3, stopping at verse 4 -- TS2009<br>
6 "And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though thistles and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or discouraged by their looks, for they are a rebellious house.<br>
7 "And you shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they are rebellious.<br>
8 "And you, son of man, hear what I am speaking to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house, open your mouth and eat what I am giving you."<br>
9 And I looked and saw a hand stretched out to me. And see, a scroll of a book was in it,<br>
10 and He spread it before me, and it was written on the inside and on the outside. And written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.<br>
1 And He said to me, "Son of man, eat what you find, eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Yis-Rye-ELL."<br>
2 And I opened my mouth, and He fed me the scroll.<br>
3 And He said to me, "Son of man, feed your stomach, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I am giving you." And I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.<br>
4 And He said to me, "Son of man, go to the house of Yis-Rye-ELL, and you shall speak to them with My words.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 10: 1-10 (NLT)<br>
1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, surrounded by a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face shone like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.<br>
(And in his hand was a small book that had been opened.)<br>
2 And in his hand was a small scroll that had been opened. He stood with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.<br>
3 And he gave a great shout like the roar of a lion. And when he shouted, the seven thunders answered.<br>
4 When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Keep secret what the seven thunders said, and do not write it down."<br>
(Seal up what the seven thunders said, and do not write it down.)<br>
5 Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward heaven.<br>
6 He swore an oath in the name of the one who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and everything in them, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. He said, "There will be no more delay.<br>
7 When the seventh angel blows his trumpet, God's mysterious plan will be fulfilled. It will happen just as he announced it to his servants the prophets."<br>
8 Then the voice from heaven spoke to me again: "Go and take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."<br>
9 So I went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll. "Yes, take it and eat it," he said. "It will be sweet as honey in your mouth, but it will turn sour in your stomach!"<br>
10 So I took the small scroll from the hand of the angel, and I ate it! It was sweet in my mouth, but when I swallowed it, it turned sour in my stomach.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 10: 1-10 (KJV)<br>
10:1 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:<br>
10:2 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,<br>
10:3 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.<br>
10:4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.<br>
10:5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,<br>
10:6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:<br>
10:7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.<br>
10:8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.<br>
10:9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.<br>
10:10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 10: 1-10 (TS2009)<br>
1 And I saw another strong messenger coming down from the heaven, robed in a cloud, and a rainbow on his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like columns of fire,<br>
2 and having in his hand a little book opened. And he placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,<br>
3 and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. And when he cried out, seven thunders spoke their sounds.<br>
4 And when the seven thunders spoke their sounds, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from the heaven saying to me, "Seal up what the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them."<br>
<br>
5 And the messenger whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the heaven,<br>
6 and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there shall be no further delay,<br>
<br>
7 but in the days of the sounding of the seventh messenger, when he is about to sound, the secret of Elohim shall also be ended, as He declared to His servants the prophets.<br>
8 And the voice which I heard out of the heaven spoke to me again and said, "Go, take the little book which is opened in the hand of the messenger standing on the sea and on the earth."<br>
9 And I went to the messenger and said to him, "Give me the little book." And he said to me,<br>
(Take it, and let it enter into you to receive knowledge, and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth.)<br>
"Take and eat it, and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth."<br>
10 And I took the little book out of the messenger's hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.<br>

<br>
Let's look again at some selected verses from The Book of Enoch.<br>
The previously lost Book of Enoch is not in the Holy Bible today, but many experts believe that it used to be.<br>
And several experts may argue that it should be put back into the Bible.<br>
The Book of Enoch is referenced in the New Testament at least 40 times.<br>
Jesus Christ actually quotes and refers to The Book of Enoch in some of his conversations, teachings and sermons.<br>
<br>
We also did some studying of The Book of Enoch back in Christian Essays 4 and in Christian Essays 7.<br>
<br>
Here are some approximate ways to pronounce and spell some words and names in the ancient Hebrew language, using English letters.<br>
Enoch is pronounced, EE-Knock. Enoch's name in Hebrew is pronounced, Haw-Nook.<br>
Using English letters instead of Hebrew characters,<br>
Enoch is spelled, E n o c h .<br>
Again, Enoch's name in Hebrew is pronounced, Haw-Nook.<br>
To spell Haw-Nook with English letters, it may end up being spelled like this.<br>
Haw-Nook can be spelled, C h a n o k .<br>
So if you see the word, Chanok, it looks like it would be pronounced, Cha-Knock,<br>
but is is actually pronounced, Haw-Nook, which is Enoch's name in Hebrew.<br>
<br>
The name of the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob, the name of the Lord, our heavenly Father, is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah if spelled using English letters, could possibly be spelled like this: Y a h u a h .<br>
In Hebrew, The Lord of Hosts is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat.<br>
So, every time there was the Hebrew words, Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat, we use the English term, The Lord of Hosts.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat, which is, the Lord of Hosts, can also mean, God of Hosts, Lord Yaw-Who-Wah God of Hosts, The Lord of Armies, The Lord of Heaven's Armies, The Lord of the Angel Armies, the God of Angel Armies, and the God of the Armies of Heaven.<br>
To spell Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat using English letters, it could be spelled like this, Y a h u a h (space) T s e v a (apostrophe) o t h .<br>
<br>
The name of Jesus in Hebrew is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, is known as the the Elect One in the book of Enoch.<br>
Jesus is Salvation.  To say that in Hebrew, we would say, Yaw-Who-Shaw is Yeh-Shoe-Uh.<br>
Yeh-Shoe-Uh means, Salvation in Hebrew.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for God, is, EE-Low-Heem.<br>
It can also be pronounced, EL-Low-Heem.<br>
To spell EE-Low-Heem with English letters, it could be spelled like this, E L o h i y m ,<br>
or sometimes, with an I instead of a Y, like this: E l o h i m .<br>
Elohim, with the letter I, is how it is spelled in the TS2009.<br>
In the Eth Cepher, it is spelled with a Y, like this, E L o h i y m .<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 42:1 (KJV)<br>
Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgement to the Gentiles.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:18 (KJV)<br>
Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; My beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, And he shall shew judgement to the Gentiles.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45:4 (KJV)<br>
For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 43:10 (KJV)<br>
Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.<br>

(Enoch) 1:1 -- English translation from the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1<br>
The word of the blessing of Enoch, how he blessed the elect and the righteous, who were to exist in the time of trouble; rejecting all the unrighteous and wicked. Enoch, a righteous man, who with God, answered and spoke, whilst his eyes were open, and he saw a holy vision in the heavens.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Most of these Enoch verses are the same ones that we have studied<br>
when we did the Bible study, titled, Enoch Samples<br>
back in Christian Essays 4.<br>
<br>
This time, we will only be reading them out of the<br>
Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1, by Cepher Publishing Group.<br>
Eth is pronounced, eht, as in the word, set, without the s sound.<br>
<br>
Remember that other English translations of the book of Enoch<br>
will have different chapter numbers and verse numbers<br>
which are usually off by one.<br>
<br>
You can find a few more English translations for free on the internet<br>
but their chapter numbers and verse numbers will not be matching up with each other.<br>
<br>
By the way, at the end of Dr Stephen Pidgeon's Preface of the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1<br>
He mentions something interesting about his analysis of the word, the people and the nation of Israel.<br>
As for the correct pronunciation of the word, Israel, he says this:<br>
"Therefore, we have concluded that the word spelled with the letters yod-shin-resh-aleph-lamed is to be pronounced "Yashar'el".<br>
<br>
So, in English, we say Is-Real.<br>
In the TS2009 translation, they say Yis-Rye-ELL.<br>
and the preface that we just quoted from, says, that Israel, if pronounced with precise technical accuracy, is supposed to be pronounced, Yaw-Shaw-Rell.<br>
So, Is-Real, Yis-Rye-ELL, Yaw-Shaw-Rell, are all referencing the nation, and the people of Israel.<br>
Since this entire Bible Greatest Hits Bible study series is an English study targeting an English audience,<br>
we say and pronounce names and places in the English language, even though those English pronunciations are technically wrong or inaccurate.<br>
So, when we say that we worship the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob,<br>
In English, those names of Abraham, Issac and Jacob -- that is not how they would be pronounced in the ancient Hebrew language.<br>
So, just keep that in mind, that, all of these English name pronunciations of Hebrew people and Hebrew cities, these English pronunciations are wrong in one way or another.<br>
Perhaps by a lack of education, ignorance, or just having a lack of access to this language information.<br>
Maybe, there were those that don't want you to know how to say those names, and they deliberately changed the name spelling a little bit?<br>
Research would need be done to investigate that further as to why we pronounce these names incorrectly in the English language.<br>
<br>
So, to summarise this...<br>
Is-Real, is instantly understood in English, but technically wrong.<br>
Yis-Rye-ELL, is more accurate, as is found that way in the TS2009, but still not exactly perfectly accurate.<br>
Yaw-Shaw-Rell, is the most technically perfect way of saying Israel in the ancient Hebrew language, but most people may not know this, and most people and most audiences may not be able to understand, stay engaged and keep following along in a Bible study if this most correct pronunciation is used, unless the audience is educated about this, like we are doing right now.<br>
<br>
We need to be careful and sensitive to those that only know English, because, the ancient Hebrew language, as beautiful and important as it is, can technically be an unknown language to an English audience.<br>
<br>
NLT of 1 Corinthians 13 -- verse 9 and verse 19<br>
9 It's the same for you. If you speak to people in words they don't understand, how will they know what you are saying? You might as well be talking into empty space.<br>
19 But in a church meeting I would rather speak five understandable words to help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language.<br>
<br>
These are the same selections that were chosen by Dr Stephen Pidgeon in May 2020, as being some of the most important and significant verses in the the Book of Enoch.<br>
These selected Enoch verses are also all listed in the Preface of the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1 .<br>
and almost all of these are the verses that we looked at before<br>
when we did the Bible study, titled, Enoch Samples<br>
back in Christian Essays 4.<br>
<br>
Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One quotes from the book of Enoch many times, which proves that Enoch is valid Scripture and is an official book of the Bible.<br>
<br>
The Eth Cepher only says the names in Hebrew. We will insert the English names here, so you can easily associate the English names with their corresponding Hebrew names.<br>
So, let's begin. These verses, the chapter numbers and verse numbers, all come from<br>
-- the English translation from the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 62:1<br>
Thus, The Lord, Yahuah commanded the kings, the princes, the exalted, and those who dwell on earth, saying: Open your eyes, and lift up your horns, if you are capable of comprehending Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 39: 5 & 6<br>
5 At that time my eyes beheld the dwelling of the elect, of truth, faith, and righteousness.<br>
6 Countless shall be the number of the holy and the elect, in the presence of God, Elohiym forever and ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 40: 3-7<br>
3 Then I heard the voices of those upon the four sides magnifying The Lord, Yahuah of glory.<br>
4 The first voice blessed The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth forever and ever.<br>
5 The second voice I heard blessing Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One, and the elect who suffer on account of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth.<br>
6 The third voice I heard petitioning and praying for those who dwell upon earth and supplicate the name of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth.<br>
7 The fourth voice I heard expelling the impious angels and prohibiting them from entering into the presence of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth, to accuse the inhabitants of the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 45: 3 & 4<br>
3 In that day shall Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One sit upon a throne of glory; and shall choose their conditions and countless habitations, whilst their spirit within them shall be strengthened, when they behold Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, my Elect One, for those who have fled for protection to my holy and glorious name.<br>
4 In that day I will cause Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, my Elect One to dwell in the midst of them; will change heaven; will bless it and illuminate it forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 45:3 gets quoted by Jesus himself, when he quotes it in<br>
John 14: 2 & 3 -- KJV<br>
14:2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<br>
14:3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Enoch) 49: 1-4<br>
1 Wisdom is poured forth like water, and glory fails not before him forever and ever; for potent is he in all the secrets of righteousness.<br>
2 But iniquity passes away like a shadow and possesses not a fixed station: for Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One stands before The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth; and his glory is forever and ever; and his power from generation to generation.<br>
3 With him dwells the Spirit of knowledge and wisdom, the Spirit of Instruction and the Spirit of Power and (the Roo-Awk) the spirit of those who sleep in righteousness; he shall judge secret things.<br>
4 Nor shall any be able to utter a single word before him; for Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One is in the presence of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth, according to his own pleasure.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch 51: 1-3<br>
1 In those days shall the earth deliver up from her womb, and Hell, Hades, She'ol deliver up from hers, that which it has received; and destruction shall restore that which it owes.<br>
2 He shall select the righteous and holy from among them; for the day of their salvation, has approached.<br>
(for the day of their Yeh-Shoe-Uh, has approached.)<br>
3 And in those days shall Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One sit upon his throne, whilst every secret of intellectual wisdom shall proceed from his mouth, for The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth has gifted and glorified him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Satan, the devil, has several names in the Bible, and in other books that used to be in the Bible.<br>
Satan, is also known as, Haw-Saw-Tawn, and also as Ah-Zah-Zell.<br>
Ah-Zah-Zell can be spelled like this: A z a (apostrophe) z e L .<br>
<br>
Enoch 55:5<br>
O you kings, O you mighty, who inhabit the world you shall behold Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, my Elect One, sitting upon the throne of my glory. And he shall judge Satan, Aza'zel, all his associates, and all his hosts, in the name of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth.<br>
<br>
In Hebrew, The Most High God, is pronounced, EL-ELLE-ON.<br>
With English letters, it gets spelled with a letter Y, like this, E L (space) E L y o n .<br>
<br>
Enoch 61: 8-12<br>
8 Then they received the commandment, all in the heavens above; to whom a combined power, voice, and splendour, like fire, were given.<br>
9 And first, with voice, they blessed him, they exalted him, they glorified him with wisdom, and ascribed to him wisdom with the word, and with the breath of life.<br>
10 Then The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth seated upon the throne of his glory Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Elect One;<br>
11 Who shall judge all the works of the holy, in heaven above, and in a balance shall he weigh their actions. And when he shall lift up his countenance to judge their secret ways in the word of the name of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth, and their progress in the path of the righteous judgement of The Most High God, El Elyon (EL-ELLE-ON);<br>
12 They shall all speak with united voice; and bless, glorify, exalt, and praise, in the name of The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezra, is a scribe and priest of the 5th century BC,<br>
4 Ezra 2 Esdras is a book that is not in the Bible.<br>
It is thought that this book was written by Ezra,<br>
but some who have analysed it may argue that it may have actually been written by someone else, sometime, it is estimated, between 70 and 218 AD.<br>
Be that as it may, even with that argument in mind, here is a quote from 4 Ezra 2 Esdras, which is also mentioned in the Eth Cepher preface.<br>
<br>
(4 Ezra 2 Esdras) chapter 14: verses 44 through 48 -- English translation from the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1<br>
44 In forty days they wrote ninety-two books.<br>
45 And it came to pass, when the forty days were filled, that The Most High God, El Elyon spoke, saying, The first that you have written publish openly, that the worthy and unworthy may read it:<br>
46 But keep the seventy last, that you may deliver them only to such as be wise among the people:<br>
47 For in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of knowledge.<br>
48 And I did so.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Baruch is pronounced, Bah-Roo-K.<br>
Baruch and Jeremiah witnessed the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem of 587-586 BC.<br>
Baruch, known as, Baruch ben Neriah, who was around back in the 6th century BC, wrote the Book of Baruch.<br>
The second book of Baruch was not written by Baruch.<br>
The books of Baruch are not in the Bible.<br>
The second book of Baruch, known as 2 Baruch, is not Scripture, and was never a book in the Bible.<br>
Its author is unknown.<br>
It was likely written in the late 1st century AD or early 2nd century AD, after the destruction of the Temple in AD 70.<br>
The Eth Cepher preface quotes from 2 Baruch, and 2 Baruch is in the Eth Cepher.<br>
However, because of the author being possibly fake or fraudulent, and since this is a Bible study,<br>
we will not looking at this book here, because it was never one of the books in the Bible historically,<br>
and it is not in our Holy Bibles today, due to this reason.<br>
Generally, it is a good idea to be extra careful and cautious with not-in-the-Bible books, as they can try to sneak in content that is not true.<br>
When the creation of the book is centuries away from the life and death of its supposed author, watch out and be sceptical, as there are some that have tried to write fake or fictional versions of the ancient books, claiming that they are these original, lost books, when, in fact, they are filled with mistakes which prove that they are fake, fictional books which someone was trying to promote as being the real deal.<br>
<br>
<br>
May EE-Low-Heem our Ah-Buh Father and our Master Jaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck give you grace and peace.<br>
All glory to EE-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah forever and ever! Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 1: 3-7 (NLT)<br>
(May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.)<br>
3 May God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.<br>
4 Jesus gave his life for our sins, just as God our Father planned, in order to rescue us from this evil world in which we live.<br>
5 All glory to God forever and ever! Amen.<br>
6 I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself (through loving mercy) through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News<br>
7 but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4: 12-15 (NLT)<br>
12 ...equip God's people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.<br>
13 This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.<br>
14 Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth.<br>
15 Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Notice how the word, Church, disappears when we read this again in the TS2009?<br>
If one was to do further research and investigation into having the word, Church, in our English translations,<br>
one might conclude that it may not be as good of a word as we might think.<br>
Was this word, Church, inserted into our New Testament English translations?<br>
There are some discussions and arguments about the word, Church, not technically being in the New Testament.<br>
It could be good thing how the TS2009 was careful to avoid inserting the word, Church, into their scriptures.<br>
Let's read that area again in the TS2009, and listen to how it sounds with the word, Church, not being in there.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4: 10-21 (TS2009)<br>
10 He who went down is also the One who went up far above all the heavens, to fill all.<br>
11 And He Himself gave some as emissaries, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers<br>
12 for the perfecting of the set-apart ones, to the work of service to a building up of the body of the Messiah,<br>
13 until we all come to the unity of the belief and of the knowledge of the Son of Elohim, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the completeness of Messiah,<br>
14 so that we should no longer be children, tossed and borne about by every wind of teaching, by the trickery of men, in cleverness, unto the craftiness of leading astray,<br>
15 but, maintaining the truth in love, we grow up in all respects into Him who is the head, Messiah,<br>
16 from whom the entire body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the working by which each part does its share, causes growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.<br>
17 So this I say, and witness in the Master, that you should no longer walk as the nations walk, in the futility of their mind,<br>
18 having been darkened in their understanding, having been estranged from the life of Elohim, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart,<br>
19 who, having become callous, have given themselves up to indecency, to work all uncleanness with greediness.<br>
20 But you have not so learned Messiah,<br>
21 if indeed you have heard Him and were taught by Him, as truth is in Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Revelation) 1:8 (TS2009)<br>
"I am the 'Aleph' and the 'Tav', Beginning and End,” says Yaw-Who-Wah "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."<br>
<br>
(Revelation) 1:8 -- English translation from the Eth Cepher 3rd Edition 2020 Revision 2.1<br>
I am the Aleph and the Tav, the beginning and the ending, says The Lord God, Yahuah Elohiym, which is, and which was, and which is to come, The Lord of Hosts, Yahuah Tseva'oth.<br>

<br>
The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew,<br>
and the New Testament was originally written in Greek.<br>
<br>
This is what pastors and Christian Churches have been stating as fact for many years.<br>
<br>
Evidence continues to mount which indicates more and more that the New Testament was originally written in Hebrew, then translated into Greek.<br>
<br>
All of our English Bible translations are translations from Greek, which are really Greek translations from Hebrew.<br>
<br>
If that is so, then, where are the Hebrew copies?<br>
<br>
In January 2020, Justin J. Van Rensburg and The Van Rensburg family did some extensive searching and found that<br>
the Cambridge University Library in the United Kingdom, and in the Vatican Library in Italy<br>
had digital colour photographs of an actual New Testament Hebrew manuscript, which are available online.<br>
<br>
<br>
Justin J. Van Rensburg and The Van Rensburg family have since been carefully translating Hebrew New Testament books<br>
from Hebrew into English.<br>
<br>
<br>
As of December 2021, only a few Hebrew New Testament books have had their English translations completed.<br>
<br>
In December 2021, they had completed their Hebrew-to-English translation of the book of Revelation.<br>
It was published in December 2021, as Version 1.1.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew manuscript used for this Hebrew-to-English translation of the book of Revelation is from the Cambridge University Library.<br>
A similar manuscript was also found in 1806 in one of the Jewish Synagogues in Cochin, India.<br>
Unfortunately, these two manuscripts have not received much attention over the past 200 years since they were brought to the UK.<br>
<br>
<br>
Justin J. Van Rensburg, gives their translation the title, Ele Ha-Sodot – The Hebrew Revelation, which is found at www.HebrewGospels.com.<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Revelation has the English translation on one page, and then the actual Hebrew text on the adjacent page.<br>
The pages alternate back and forth like this.<br>
<br>
So, that has me curious about something.<br>
What did the Hebrew New Testament do with the Mark of the Beast, 666?<br>
<br>
Let's find out.<br>
<br>
We previously talked about this in Christian Essays 18.<br>
<br>
About one-third of the way down the page is a random area within which we studied that number 666.<br>
<br>
In the Greek translation,<br>
The first Greek character is pronounced, Schee<br>
The second character is pronounced, See<br>
and the third one is, Steeg-Mah<br>
<br>
What does it say in the Hebrew-to-English translation?<br>
<br>
Let's now look at these verses from the Hebrew-to-English translation by Justin J. Van Rensburg, titled, Ele Ha-Sodot -- The Hebrew Revelation, December 2021, Version 1.1, available at www.HebrewGospels.com<br>
<br>
Revelation 14: 9-12<br>
9 And after this, the third messenger came and said with a great voice, "If one does his prayer (to the image,) to the carved image and to the animal, and take the sign on his hand or on his forehead -<br>
10 this one will drink of the wine of the fury of Yaw-Who-Wah, which is in the cup of fury, and he will be punished with fire and brimstone before his set-apart messengers and the Lamb.<br>
11 And the smoke of their punishment will go up from everlasting and unto everlasting, (forever and ever) and they will not have rest, day or night, those who took the sign and prayed to the carved image."<br>
12 Here is the hope of the set-apart ones, and here are those who do the commandments of Yaw-Who-Wah, and believe in Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 13:18<br>
Here is wisdom and understanding: whosoever has insight needs to reckon the number of the animal, for it is the number of a man, and the amount is found, (and he will find that the amount is) six hundred and sixty and six.<br>
<br>
Here are the Hebrew letters that make up<br>
<br>
six hundred and sixty and six<br>
<br>
<br>
600<br>
Vahv<br>
Tov<br>
Mem<br>
Saudi<br>
All-if<br>
<br>
<br>
60<br>
Tet<br>
Salmick<br>
Raysh<br>
<br>
6<br>
Hey<br>
Yould<br>
All-if<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Since Hebrew letters are based on pictures,<br>
do these pictures, presented in this particular sequence, tell us anything about 666?<br>
<br>
<br>
600<br>
Vahv -- Hook, nail (secure)<br>
Tov -- Mark (sign)<br>
Mem -- Water (Chaos)<br>
Saudi -- Fish hook, man on side, catch<br>
All-if -- Head, Strength, crown, first<br>
<br>
<br>
60<br>
Tet -- Tent, wall, force, separation<br>
Salmick -- hand on staff, support, prop<br>
Raysh -- Man's head, first chief, Highest<br>
<br>
6<br>
Hey -- Window, Behold!, Reveal<br>
Yould -- Hand, Work, Deed<br>
All-if -- Head, Strength, crown, first<br>
<br>
Here is a possible or potential way to produce some meaning or interpretation.<br>
These are just some ideas to consider, based on the Hebrew letter pictures and the order presented.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
<br>
The short summary is, the Sign of the Animal, the Mark of the Beast, when hooked into and secured into a man, brings about chaos, taking away man's thinking and strength, and what he seeks first.<br>
It puts up walls of separation.<br>
The Mark of the Beast is a window that can reveal the hand and the head of the Beast, that is, the works and the thoughts of the Beast, and his strategies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
600<br>
Vahv -- Hook, nail (secure)<br>
Tov -- Mark (sign)<br>
Mem -- Water (Chaos)<br>
Saudi -- Fish hook, man on side, catch<br>
All-if -- Head, Strength, crown, first<br>
<br>
600<br>
The Mark of the Beast uses a sharp instrument, like a hook or a nail, to secure itself.<br>
This is in the same way how a hook in a fish secures itself into the fish, securing the direction that the fish will go.<br>
Satan is also trying to be a fisher of men, as he goes fishing with this special hook.<br>
Securing this mark into the self will bring about chaos into the world, as well as chaos into the one who is hooked on it or addicted to worshipping it.<br>
Once the hook is secured, it can weaken and take a man's strength, and make a man lie down on his side, forcing him to take a side.<br>
It catches the man, and, once caught, his head is caught, what he thinks is caught.<br>
His strength is caught, what comes first to mind is now caught and secured.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
60<br>
Tet -- Tent, wall, force, separation<br>
Salmick -- hand on staff, support, prop<br>
Raysh -- Man's head, first chief, Highest<br>
<br>
<br>
60<br>
The Mark of the Beast will cause a wall of separation.<br>
People will be forced to be walled in, forced to live in a tent, or in a walled city or facility.<br>
People will be forced to keep themselves separated.<br>
(That makes me also think about a set-apart people being set-apart.)<br>
The Good Shepherd will have his hand on His staff.  His rod and His staff will comfort us.<br>
He will continue to support us and keep us propped up so we can be victorious.<br>
We will help prop each other up, in the same way how Moses had his arm and staff propped up so they would have the upper hand and the victory.<br>
The Mark of the Beast will force people to separate themselves.<br>
Because they can buy and sell with it, it will appear to prop up the beast, exalting the beast, showing support and allegiance to the beast.<br>
Man's head and what he thinks will be to think of the beast as the first chief, the primary leader, the most high, the highest, the greatest.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6<br>
Hey -- Window, Behold!, Reveal<br>
Yould -- Hand, Work, Deed<br>
All-if -- Head, Strength, crown, first<br>
<br>
6<br>
The Mark of the Beast will eventually be a way to look into the beast.<br>
It will be a window where one can look into and behold what the beast is really doing and thinking.<br>
What the beast's hand is doing, the works he is working and the deeds that he is performing.<br>
That which is going on inside the head of the beast, how the mark strengthens him, and makes him feel glorious and prideful.<br>
The mark of the beast is something that will show and reveal what the beast's hand is really doing, and what the beast's mind is really thinking.<br>
<br>
If the Mark of the Beast is something technological, then this might suggest that, if one can hack into this technology, one can access the thoughts, actions, plans and strategies of the beast.<br>
This hacked, revealing window might be a way to access helpful intelligence to stay one step ahead.<br>
<br>

Revelation 1:8<br>
yes Ah-Main! (Yes, surely, truly)<br>
8 "I am the first and the last, the beginning and the end," says the mighty (majestic) Adon, (Ah-Doe-Nye, lord, master) who was and is and will be.<br>
