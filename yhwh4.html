The Christian Essays are attempts to provide insight, meaning, understanding, interpretation and encouragement from various verses, paragraphs, stories and chapters of the Bible.<br>
<br>

Bible scriptures are quoted from one of these five English translations:<br>
King James Version (KJV) (1611)<br>
New King James Version (NKJV) (1982)<br>
New International Version (NIV) (1978, with revisions published in 1984 and 2011.)<br>
New Living Translation (NLT) (1996, with revisions published in 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2015.)<br>
New American Standard Bible (NASB) (1995)<br>
<br>
Different people all reading from the NLT may not each see the exact same wording in the NLT, due to the multiple revisions published.<br>
<br>
<br>
The NIV was updated in 1984 and 2011.<br>
Some have rejected the NIV 2011 update because of gender-neutral language.<br>
If different people are studying together in the NIV version, they may encounter differences in the wording due to the different NIV editions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even though there is now a 2020 edition of the New American Standard Bible (NASB), when we choose to occasionally quote the NASB, we will be quoting from the previous, 1995 edition, unless we specifically say otherwise.<br>

Previously, at the end of Christian Essays 3, we were looking at Ezekiel 37.<br>
After Ezekiel 37, which was talking about A Valley of Dry Bones,<br>
Ezekiel talks about the Reunion of Israel and Judah.<br>
In chapter 38, he gives A Message for Gog of the land of Magog,<br>
that starts in Chapter 38 and continues into Chapter 39.<br>
It is very interesting. Because we have here many verses spanning across two chapters, let's just read it now, only in the NLT.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel chapter 38, verse 1, and we read all 23 verses of chapter 38, and, without stopping, we continue reading in the NLT, going into the next chapter, Ezekiel chapter 39, stopping at chapter 39, verse 16.<br>
<br>
1 This is another message that came to me from the Lord:<br>
2 "Son of man, turn and face Gog of the land of Magog, the prince who rules over the nations of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him.<br>
3 Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord: Gog, I am your enemy!<br>
4 I will turn you around and put hooks in your jaws to lead you out with your whole army -- your horses and charioteers in full armour and a great horde armed with shields and swords.<br>
<br>
(Paras, Cush, and Put are known today as Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya. Paras, Cush, and Put will join you, too, with all their weapons.)<br>
5 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya will join you, too, with all their weapons.<br>
6 Gomer and all its armies will also join you, along with the armies of Beth-togarmah from the distant north, and many others.<br>
7 "Get ready; be prepared! Keep all the armies around you mobilised, and take command of them.<br>
8 A long time from now you will be called into action. In the distant future you will swoop down on the land of Israel, which will be enjoying peace after recovering from war and after its people have returned from many lands to the mountains of Israel.<br>
9 You and all your allies -- a vast and awesome army -- will roll down on them like a storm and cover the land like a cloud.<br>
10 "This is what the Sovereign Lord says: At that time evil thoughts will come to your mind, and you will devise a wicked scheme.<br>
11 You will say, 'Israel is an unprotected land filled with unwalled villages! I will march against her and destroy these people who live in such confidence!<br>
12 I will go to those formerly desolate cities that are now filled with people who have returned from exile in many nations. I will capture vast amounts of plunder, for the people are rich with livestock and other possessions now. They think the whole world revolves around them!'<br>
13 But Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish will ask, 'Do you really think the armies you have gathered can rob them of silver and gold? Do you think you can drive away their livestock and seize their goods and carry off plunder?'<br>
<br>
<br>
14 "Therefore, son of man, prophesy against Gog. Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord: When my people are living in peace in their land, then you will rouse yourself.<br>
(When my people are living in peace in their land, then you will know.)<br>
<br>
15 You will come from your homeland in the distant north with your vast cavalry and your mighty army,<br>
16 and you will attack my people Israel, covering their land like a cloud. At that time in the distant future, I will bring you against my land as everyone watches, and my holiness will be displayed by what happens to you, Gog. Then all the nations will know that I am the Lord.<br>
17 "This is what the Sovereign Lord asks: Are you the one I was talking about long ago, when I announced through Israel's prophets that in the future I would bring you against my people?<br>
18 But this is what the Sovereign Lord says: When Gog invades the land of Israel, my fury will boil over!<br>
19 In my jealousy and blazing anger, I promise a mighty shaking in the land of Israel on that day.<br>
20 All living things -- the fish in the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, the small animals that scurry along the ground, and all the people on earth -- will quake in terror at my presence. Mountains will be thrown down; cliffs will crumble; walls will fall to the earth.<br>
21 I will summon the sword against you on all the hills of Israel, says the Sovereign Lord. Your men will turn their swords against each other.<br>
22 I will punish you and your armies with disease and bloodshed; I will send torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and burning sulphur!<br>
23 In this way, I will show my greatness and holiness, and I will make myself known to all the nations of the world. Then they will know that I am the Lord.<br>
1 "Son of man, prophesy against Gog. Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord: I am your enemy, O Gog, ruler of the nations of Meshech and Tubal.<br>
2 I will turn you around and drive you toward the mountains of Israel, bringing you from the distant north (the sides of the north).<br>
(And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee.)<br>
(And I will turn thee back, and strike thee with six plagues.)<br>
(And I will draw thee back with an hook of six teeth.)<br>
<br>
3 I will knock the bow from your left hand and the arrows from your right hand, and I will leave you helpless.<br>
4 You and your army and your allies will all die on the mountains. I will feed you to the vultures and wild animals.<br>
5 You will fall in the open fields, for I have spoken, says the Sovereign Lord.<br>
6 And I will rain down fire on Magog and on all your allies who live safely on the coasts. Then they will know that I am the Lord.<br>
7 "In this way, I will make known my holy name among my people of Israel. I will not let anyone bring shame on it. And the nations, too, will know that I am the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.<br>
8 That day of judgement will come, says the Sovereign Lord. Everything will happen just as I have declared it.<br>
9 "Then the people in the towns of Israel will go out and pick up your small and large shields, bows and arrows, javelins and spears, and they will use them for fuel. There will be enough to last them seven years!<br>
10 They won't need to cut wood from the fields or forests, for these weapons will give them all the fuel they need. They will plunder those who planned to plunder them, and they will rob those who planned to rob them, says the Sovereign Lord.<br>
<br>
11 "And I will make a vast graveyard for Gog and his hordes in the Valley of the Travelers, east of the Dead Sea. It will block the way of those who travel there, (it shall stop the noses and mouths of the passengers who travel there,) and they will change the name of the place to the Valley of Gog's Hordes (The multitude of Gog).<br>
<br>
12 It will take seven months for the people of Israel to bury the bodies and cleanse the land.<br>
13 Everyone in Israel will help, for it will be a glorious victory for Israel when I demonstrate my glory on that day, says the Sovereign Lord.<br>
14 "After seven months, teams of men will be appointed to search the land for skeletons to bury, so the land will be made clean again.<br>
15 Whenever bones are found, (they will build a sign, or) a marker will be set up so the burial crews will take them to be buried in the Valley of Gog's Hordes.<br>
16 (There will be a town there named Hamonah, which means, The multitude, or, 'horde.') And so the land will finally be cleansed.<br>
<br>
And so we stop right there at Ezekiel chapter 39, verse 16, NLT.<br>
That's all we're going to look at for now, in the book of Ezekiel.<br>
Ezekiel goes on to talk about the Restoration for God's People, and the measurements of The New Temple Area.<br>

<big>Some Additional Bonus Bible Studies</big><br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms chapter 1<br>
<br>
Commentary: Notice, in verse 1 of Psalms chapter 1, when sin and evil are creeping into your life, first you walk to it, then you spend time, standing around with it, then you sit down with it.  First you walk, then you stand still, hanging around it, then you sit down and spend time in its company.<br>
New Living Translation says that, in verse 1, first you follow it around to where it is (evil and sin), then you stand still, being around it, then you join in and participate, saying and doing the same thing that the others around you are also saying and doing.<br>
Be careful where you walk, where you stand, where you hang around, what you dabble in, and what you click on, or, before you know it, you'll be just like one of them, thinking the same way, saying the same things they say, and doing the same things they do.<br>
The kind of people that you hang out with and spend time with, that is the kind of person you will become.<br>
What is the difference between a thermostat and a thermometer?  Which one are you?  Which one are you going to be when you go to that party?<br>
<br>
Psalms 1 (KJV)<br>
1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly (that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked), nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.<br>
2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.<br>
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither (his leaf also shall not fade); and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.<br>
4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.<br>
5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgement, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br>
6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 1 (NLT)<br>
Book One (Psalms 1–41)<br>
<br>
1<br>
Oh, the joys of those who do not<br>
follow the advice of the wicked,<br>
or stand around with sinners,<br>
or join in with mockers.<br>
2<br>
But they delight in the law of the Lord,<br>
meditating on it day and night.<br>
3<br>
They are like trees planted along the riverbank,<br>
bearing fruit each season.<br>
Their leaves never wither,<br>
and they prosper in all they do.<br>
4<br>
But not the wicked!<br>
They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind.<br>
5<br>
They will be condemned at the time of judgement.<br>
Sinners will have no place among the godly.<br>
6<br>
For the Lord watches over the path of the godly,<br>
but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.<br>

Psalms 91 -- KJV:<br>
1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty (shall lodge under the shadow of the Almighty).<br>
2 I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.<br>
3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.<br>
4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.<br>
5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;<br>
6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.<br>
7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.<br>
8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.<br>
9 Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;<br>
10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.<br>
11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.<br>
12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.<br>
13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder (thou shalt tread upon the lion and asp, or serpent): the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.<br>
14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.<br>
15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.<br>
16 With long life (with length of days) will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 91 -- NLT:<br>
1<br>
Those who live in the shelter of the Most High<br>
will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.<br>
2<br>
This I declare about the Lord:<br>
He alone is my refuge, my place of safety;<br>
he is my God, and I trust him.<br>
3<br>
For he will rescue you from every trap<br>
and protect you from deadly disease.<br>
4<br>
He will cover you with his feathers.<br>
He will shelter you with his wings.<br>
His faithful promises are your armour and protection.<br>
5<br>
Do not be afraid of the terrors of the night,<br>
nor the arrow that flies in the day.<br>
6<br>
Do not dread the disease that stalks in darkness,<br>
nor the disaster that strikes at midday.<br>
7<br>
Though a thousand fall at your side,<br>
though ten thousand are dying around you,<br>
these evils will not touch you.<br>
8<br>
Just open your eyes,<br>
and see how the wicked are punished.<br>
9<br>
If you make the Lord your refuge,<br>
if you make the Most High your shelter,<br>
10<br>
no evil will conquer you;<br>
no plague will come near your home.<br>
11<br>
For he will order his angels<br>
to protect you wherever you go.<br>
12<br>
They will hold you up with their hands<br>
so you won't even hurt your foot on a stone.<br>
13<br>
You will trample upon lions and cobras;<br>
you will crush fierce lions and serpents under your feet!<br>
14<br>
The Lord says, "I will rescue those who love me.<br>
I will protect those who trust in my name.<br>
15<br>
When they call on me, I will answer;<br>
I will be with them in trouble.<br>
I will rescue and honor them.<br>
16<br>
I will reward them with a long life<br>
and give them my salvation."<br>
<br>

Commentary: I like to use the term, ploughing through the scriptures, because, sometimes it can be quite a battle and lots of hard work just to make the time to read through your Bible and pray, every single day, and to push away the busyness and distractions of the day.  If the devil can't make you bad, he'll make you busy.<br>
<br>
Commentary: When leaders are worth following, when church is being done right, when people are teaching and studying through the entire Bible, cover-to-cover, ploughing through every verse and chapter, truthfully and completely, not just hearing and reading the Bible, but doing the Bible, when everyone is doing their part, it all fits neatly together, and works out right, and it will all look as it is described below.<br>
But when people are not doing their part, when the Bible teachings, church services and Bible studies are not being done right, when some verses and chapters are skipped and avoided, and the Bible teachings and studies are ignored or avoided, seen as being too boring or offensive, and the people are not listening, trusting, following and obeying the Lord, then, you will see the exact and complete opposite of everything described below.<br>
<br>
When a church is studying and doing church right, many of the parts and pieces of that Church body will be in alignment with what is described and recommended below.<br>
If a church is not reading through the entire Bible, and they are doing things there that are in direct opposition to what the Bible teaches, then you will see more and more of the opposite of everything described and recommended below.<br>

1 Corinthians 14 (KJV) -- verses 33, 34 and 35<br>
33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.<br>
34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.<br>
35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 14 (NLT) -- verses 33, 34 and 35<br>
33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the meetings of God's holy people.<br>
(As in all the meetings of God's holy people, women should be silent during the church meetings.)<br>
34 Women should be silent during the church meetings. It is not proper for them to speak. They should be submissive, just as the law says. <br>
35 If they have any questions, they should ask their husbands at home, for it is improper for women to speak in church meetings.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2 (KJV) -- verses 11 and 12<br>
11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.<br>
12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2 (NLT) -- verses 11 and 12<br>
11 Women should learn quietly and submissively. <br>
12 I do not let women teach men or have authority over them. (I do not let women teach men or usurp their authority.) Let them listen quietly.<br>
<br>
the definition of, usurp:<br>
to take someone else's power, position, job etc when you do not have the right to.<br>
to take possession of (eg land) or assume (eg power, authority, a title, etc) by force, without right or unjustly.<br>
to take control of a position of power, especially without having the right to<br>
Take (a position of power or importance) illegally or by force.<br>
Encroach or infringe upon (someone's rights)<br>
<br>
(Definitions above are from 2018 editions of the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries)<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
1 Corinthians is a letter written by Paul.<br>
1 Timothy is a letter, and we do not know who wrote it, but our best guess would be one of Paul's students.<br>
These two passages, are from 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy.<br>
They are not laws and commandments spoken by God and given to Moses in the Old Testament.<br>
They are not laws and commandments spoken by God and given to Jesus in the New Testament.<br>
They are letters. Since they are letters giving advice and having comments by Paul,<br>
it sounds like Paul was annoyed at a loud woman that would not stop talking the last time he was at their gathering.<br>
These are only comments, suggestions and ideas to consider when starting a new church.<br>
They are not to be held up as high as Torah Law and Commandments.<br>
Paul does quote and reference some Torah laws in some places in his letters.<br>
<br>
There were many women in the Bible that were not silent. They are heroes in the Bible.<br>
They saved lives. They stopped wars. They killed enemies. They made a difference, forever. They were not silent.<br>
<br>
We will talk some more about Paul's letters, and about some of the women heroes of the Bible,<br>
when we do a Bible Study, titled, Paul & Women,<br>
which is what we will read when we eventually get to Christian Essays 29,<br>
The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 29.<br>

Titus 2:4 (NLT) These older women must train the younger women....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 2 (KJV) -- verses 1 through 8<br>
1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:<br>
2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.<br>
3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;<br>
4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,<br>
5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.<br>
6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.<br>
7 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,<br>
8 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.<br>
<br>
Titus 2 (NLT) -- verses 1 through 8<br>
1 As for you, Titus, promote the kind of living that reflects wholesome teaching. <br>
2 Teach the older men to exercise self-control, to be worthy of respect, and to live wisely. They must have sound faith and be filled with love and patience.<br>
3 Similarly, teach the older women to live in a way that honours God. They must not slander others or be heavy drinkers. (They must not be enslaved to much wine.) Instead, they should teach others what is good. <br>
4 These older women must train the younger women to love their husbands and their children, <br>
5 to live wisely and be pure, to work in their homes (to care for their homes), to do good, and to be submissive to their husbands. Then they will not bring shame on the word of God.<br>
6 In the same way, encourage the young men to live wisely. <br>
7 And you yourself must be an example to them by doing good works of every kind. Let everything you do reflect the integrity and seriousness of your teaching. <br>
8 Teach the truth so that your teaching can't be criticised. Then those who oppose us will be ashamed and have nothing bad to say about us.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 4:7 (KJV)<br>
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5:5 (KJV)<br>
Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5:21 (KJV)<br>
Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.<br>
<br>
Commentary: When talking about husbands and wives in Ephesians chapter 5, it first says to submit yourselves one to another. Before it talks about one or the other, it first says for them both to submit to each other.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5 (KJV)<br>
21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.<br>
22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.<br>
23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.<br>
24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.<br>
25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;<br>
26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,<br>
27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.<br>
28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.<br>
29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:<br>
30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<br>
31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.<br>
32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.<br>
33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5 (NLT)<br>
21 ...submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.<br>
22 For wives, this means submit to your husbands as to the Lord. <br>
23 For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. He is the Savior of his body, the church. <br>
24 As the church submits to Christ, so you wives should submit to your husbands in everything.<br>
25 For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her <br>
26 to make her holy and clean, washed by the cleansing of God's word (washed by water with the word).<br>
27 He did this to present her to himself as a glorious church without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead, she will be holy and without fault. <br>
28 In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as they love their own bodies. For a man who loves his wife actually shows love for himself. <br>
29 No one hates his own body but feeds and cares for it, just as Christ cares for the church. <br>
30 And we are members of his body.<br>
31 As the Scriptures say, "A man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one." (Gen 2:24) <br>
32 This is a great mystery, but it is an illustration of the way Christ and the church are one. <br>
33 So again I say, each man must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.<br>

Prayers Not Answered<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Some reasons why your prayers may not be answered...<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3:7 (KJV)<br>
7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.<br>
NLT:<br>
In the same way, you husbands must give honour to your wives. Treat your wife with understanding as you live together. She may be weaker than you are, but she is your equal partner in God's gift of new life. Treat her as you should so your prayers will not be hindered.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 5:14 (KJV)<br>
14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:<br>
NLT:<br>
We are confident that he hears us whenever we ask for anything that pleases him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Psalm 66:18 (KJV)<br>
18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:<br>
NLT:<br>
If I had not confessed the sin in my heart,<br>
the Lord would not have listened.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
James 4: 2,3 (KJV)<br>
2 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.<br>
3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.<br>
NLT:<br>
2 You want what you don't have, so you scheme and kill to get it. You are jealous of what others have, but you can't get it, so you fight and wage war to take it away from them. Yet you don't have what you want because you don't ask God for it. <br>
3 And even when you ask, you don't get it because your motives are all wrong -- you want only what will give you pleasure.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:9 (KJV)<br>
9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.<br>

of a person who ignores the law.<br>

Those who shut their ears to the cries of the poor<br>
will be ignored in their own time of need.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59:2 (KJV)<br>
Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.<br>

Because of your sins, he has turned away<br>
and will not listen anymore.<br>

Malachi 2 (KJV) verse 16<br>
16 For the Lord, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away (he hateth to put away): for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the Lord of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.<br>
<br>
Malachi 2 (NLT) end of verse 15, and verse 16<br>
 So guard your heart; remain loyal to the wife of your youth. <br>
16 "For I hate divorce!" (He hates divorcing.) says the Lord, the God of Israel. "To divorce your wife is to overwhelm her with cruelty, (To divorce your wife is to cover one's garment with violence,)" says the Lord of Heaven's Armies. "So guard your heart; do not be unfaithful to your wife."<br>

<br>
1 Peter 3:15 (KJV)<br>
...be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you...<br>
NLT:<br>
...if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3, verses 12 through 17, KJV...<br>
<br>
12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.<br>
13 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?<br>
14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;<br>
15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:<br>
16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.<br>
17 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3, verses 10 through 12 are quoting from Psalms 34:12-16<br>
here is NLT:<br>
10<br>
For the Scriptures say,<br>
"If you want to enjoy life<br>
and see many happy days,<br>
keep your tongue from speaking evil<br>
and your lips from telling lies.<br>
11<br>
Turn away from evil and do good.<br>
Search for peace, and work to maintain it.<br>
12<br>
The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right,<br>
and his ears are open to their prayers.<br>
But the Lord turns his face<br>
against those who do evil."<br>
<br>
(Psalms 34:12-16)<br>
<br>
<br>
(The phrase within round brackets is sometimes placed at the end of verse 15.)<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3:13<br>
Now, who will want to harm you if you are eager to do good? <br>
14<br>
But even if you suffer for doing what is right, God will reward you for it. <br>
So don't worry or be afraid of their threats. <br>
15 Instead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it. (But do this in a gentle and respectful way.)<br>
16 But do this in a gentle and respectful way. Keep your conscience clear. Then if people speak against you, they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ. <br>
17 Remember, it is better to suffer for doing good, if that is what God wants, than to suffer for doing wrong!<br>

<p>
<br>
The Beatitudes<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The chapter numbers and punctuation were added later. The Bible did not have Chapter and verse numbers until the year 1560.<br>
If it sounds like the chapter should not have incremented in that spot, you may be right about that.<br>
Also, if the start and end of a sentence seems odd, remember that the punctuation was added later.<br>
If it sounds like part of one sentence should have been part of other one before or after that, you may be right.<br>
<br>
Don't assume that you should always start and stop where the chapters start and stop. There originally were no chapters.<br>
Try to start reading a few verses at the end of the previous chapter, and keep reading into the next chapter at least a few more verses, as though the chapter increment did not exist.<br>
You might see some things that you may not have otherwise seen, because the chapter numbers were not originally there.<br>
In the KJV, try to also skip the words in italics.  The italic words have a slightly slanted, fancy, curvy look that is different from the regular text.<br>
For example, <i>this is what italic text can look like</i> when compared to regular text.<br>
In the KJV Bible, those words in italics were not originally there.  Those additional English words were added to help understand the verse more easily and clearly.<br>
You might pull out some additional insight and see a more interesting meaning of the verse if you skip over the italic words.<br>
<br>
Also, the unofficial titles were added later.<br>
Some famous teachings were later given titles, which are more like unofficial nicknames.<br>
It's a commonly accepted way to refer to a famous teaching without having to explain it or summarise it again.<br>
<br>
One such famous teaching is known as the Beatitudes.<br>
The Beatitudes were part of The Sermon on the Mount. It's a sermon that Jesus did.<br>
In the book of Matthew, there are nine Beatitudes.<br>
<br>
In the book of Luke, there are four Beatitudes, but Luke has something interesting after that.<br>
Luke, and only Luke, goes on to mention four woes, or four sorrows.<br>
<br>
I like to think of the four woes as the Un-Beatitudes, or Non-Beatitudes, because those four woes sound kind of like they are opposites of the Beatitudes.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at Matthew and Luke and see how they did the Beatitudes teaching, and then we'll keep going in the book of Luke to read about the Un-Beatitudes, or Non-Beatitudes that only Luke does.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5, verses 1 through 12, KJV<br>
<br>
1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:<br>
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,<br>
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.<br>
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.<br>
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.<br>
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.<br>
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.<br>
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.<br>
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.<br>
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5, verses 1 through 12, NLT<br>
1 One day as he saw the crowds gathering, Jesus went up on the mountainside and sat down. His disciples gathered around him, <br>
2 and he began to teach them.<br>
3<br>
"(God blesses those who are poor in spirit,) God blesses those who are poor and realise their need for him,<br>
for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.<br>
4<br>
God blesses those who mourn,<br>
for they will be comforted.<br>
5<br>
God blesses those who are humble,<br>
for they will inherit the whole earth.<br>
6<br>
God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice (and righteousness)<br>
for they will be satisfied.<br>
7<br>
God blesses those who are merciful,<br>
for they will be shown mercy.<br>
8<br>
God blesses those whose hearts are pure,<br>
for they will see God.<br>
9<br>
God blesses those who work for peace,<br>
for they will be called the children of God.<br>
10<br>
God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right,<br>
for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.<br>
11 "God blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers. <br>
12 Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 6, verses 18 through 28, KJV:<br>
18 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.<br>
19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.<br>
20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.<br>
21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.<br>
22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.<br>
23 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.<br>
24 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.<br>
25 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.<br>
26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.<br>
27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,<br>
28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 6, verses 18 through 28, NLT:<br>
18 They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those troubled by evil spirits were healed. (Those troubled by unclean spirits were healed.) <br>
19 Everyone tried to touch him, because healing power went out from him, and he healed everyone.<br>
20 Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said,<br>
"God blesses you who are poor,<br>
for the Kingdom of God is yours.<br>
21 God blesses you who are hungry now,<br>
for you will be satisfied.<br>
God blesses you who weep now,<br>
for in due time you will laugh.<br>
22 What blessings await you when people hate you and exclude you and mock you and curse you as evil because you follow the Son of Man. <br>
23 When that happens, be happy! Yes, leap for joy! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, their ancestors treated the ancient prophets that same way.<br>
24 "What sorrow awaits you who are rich,<br>
for you have your only happiness now.<br>
25 What sorrow awaits you who are fat and prosperous now,<br>
for a time of awful hunger awaits you.<br>
What sorrow awaits you who laugh now,<br>
for your laughing will turn to mourning and sorrow.<br>
26 What sorrow awaits you who are praised by the crowds,<br>
for their ancestors also praised false prophets.<br>
27 "But to you who are willing to listen, I say, love your enemies! Do good to those who hate you. <br>
28 Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who hurt you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
That was just a basic, general look at the Beatitudes teaching of Jesus Christ.<br>
If you were to dig down deep into each verse, you could pull out even more buried treasure from each verse.<br>
I just want to give you a quick example of what it can look like do some in-depth research on a Bible verse.<br>
Matthew 5, verse 5, KJV said...<br>
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.<br>
NLT took the word, meek, and decided to use the word, humble, in that place.<br>
The Old Testament is in Hebrew, and the New Testament is in Greek.<br>
What was the original Greek word right there that was translated into the word, meek, in KJV, or humble, in the NLT?<br>
Let's look it up in the Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Strong's Concordance, by James Strong, first published in 1890.<br>
The original Greek word for meek, was pronounced, plah-ouse or plah-ahs.<br>
meek means, mild, gentle.<br>
humble (So, we know now that the NLT selected the right word.)<br>
mildness of disposition, gentleness of spirit, meekness<br>
<br>
If we look at the definitions of meek from the 2018 editions of the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries, the definitions of meek would include...<br>
very quiet and gentle and unwilling to argue with people.<br>
having a mild and gentle temperament, submissive.<br>
quiet, gentle, and not willing to argue or express your opinions in a forceful way.<br>
patient, long-suffering, or submissive in disposition or nature; humble.<br>
Meek can be seen in a negative or insulting way, as...<br>
gentle and quiet, and likely to do what other people say.<br>
spineless or spiritless; compliant.<br>
easily imposed on; submissive.<br>
<br>
<br>
That is only a very short example of digging deeper into a Bible verse.<br>
There are many other resources out there, physical books, websites, audio and video recordings of sermons, including many good Bible Commentaries to read, where you can easily spend over an hour just researching and investigating the value, the meaning, and the treasures hiding within a single Bible verse.<br>
Every single Bible verse can be like that! If someone could spend one hour studying one Bible verse, and there are 31,173 verses in the Bible, it would take you over three and a half years to study the Bible, and that does not include any time for taking breaks or sleeping.<br>
<br>
<br>
And, remember, if you read a verse, and you don't really understand it, and you don't have the time or available resources to investigate or research that verse, you can always turn that verse into a prayer.<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, I don't know what the word, Meek, means, but you tell us that it is a good quality to have.<br>
Or, maybe I don't like the idea of being meek, because meek rhymes with weak, and sounds like someone wimpy, without any strength or a mind of their own.<br>
Help me be the person that you want me to be. Help me do what the Bible says, and help me obey the instructions and commandments that you and the Bible are trying to teach me.<br>
Help me have and keep the qualities and characteristics that you say would be good to have, that would be a blessing to you, to myself and to others.<br>
Cast out of me and keep far away from me the bad qualities and characteristics that would eventually cause sorrows, woes, harm and destruction to myself and others, and any amount of separation from you.<br>
Help me take this verse and apply it to me, my life and who I am as a person. I pray this, in Jesus' Name, Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Before we move on, there is an interesting little thing that I saw in Luke 6 that reminds me of some verses in the book of Proverbs:<br>
Looking again at...<br>
Luke 6, Verse 26:<br>
KJV:<br>
26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.<br>
NLT:<br>
26 What sorrow awaits you who are praised by the crowds,<br>
for their ancestors also praised false prophets.<br>
<br>
Compare that with...<br>
Proverbs 27:2 (KJV)<br>
Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
2 Let someone else praise you, not your own mouth -- <br>
a stranger, not your own lips.<br>
<br>
Using Strong's to look at the original wording, we can see, in these two areas...<br>
<br>
Luke 6:26 --  All Men, All Humans, to speak or say well, nobly, honourably, rightly of you.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 27:2 --  Another Man, Someone Else, a stranger, be clear; to shine; hence to make a show; to boast; to rave; to celebrate.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:18 (KJV)<br>
Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.<br>
NLT:<br>
18 Pride goes before destruction,<br>
and haughtiness before a fall.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  In conclusion, if just one person, a stranger, happens to have some positive things to say about you, that can be good and healthy, but when large amounts of people start to praise you and speak well of you, that may not be a good thing, leading to sorrows and woes later on.<br>
Someone, a stranger, not someone you know, encouraging you to be bold, brave and courageous is one thing, but having many crowds of people praising you can eventually lead to arrogance and pride, and can trip a person up and make them fall down later on.<br>

In the Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Strong's Concordance, by James Strong, first published in 1890,<br>
The Hebrew word for, Holy, is pronounced, Kah-Doesh -- KahDoughSh<br>
Holy means, ceremonially or morally sacred, a saint, a sanctuary, set apart, clean<br>
All saved and believing Christians are saints. The Bible teaches this as being true.<br>
<br>
If you take the definitions of Holy and Sacred from the 2018 editions of the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries, and point them all to the Lord, you get something like this...<br>
<br>
Holy is sacred.<br>
Holy unto God also means,<br>
Sacred unto God<br>
very important to God or greatly respected<br>
devoted to the Lord,<br>
regarded with deep and solemn respect,<br>
consecrated to the Lord<br>
We are dedicated unto the Lord.<br>
Something that is sacred is believed to be holy and to have a special connection with God.<br>
You can describe something or someone as sacred when it is regarded as too important to be changed or interfered with.<br>
To be holy means that you are connected with God.<br>
<br>
To consecrate, means, to set apart as holy, for a holy use; to make sacred; to be dedicated to God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Because we are Holy unto the Lord, we are not to be challenged, violated or breached in any circumstances.<br>
<br>

Psalms 105: 14 & 15, KJV<br>
14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;<br>
15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 105: 13, 14 & 15, NLT<br>
13 They wandered from nation to nation,<br>
from one kingdom to another.<br>
14 Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.<br>
He warned kings on their behalf:<br>
15 "Do not touch my chosen people,<br>
and do not hurt my prophets."<br>

<br>
The Creed and Resurrection of Christ<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Resurrection of Christ<br>
<br>
Commentary: He died, He was buried, He was Resurrected, and He was seen again, and appeared to over 500 witnesses, the same people who saw him die and get buried.<br>
All four of these events need to be true.  If any one of them is not true, then none of it can be true, or be of any value.<br>
After the early church started, some people were saying that some parts of the Christian religion was not true, like the part where Jesus was Resurrected.<br>
But if that part is not true, then the entire Christian religion would become false and fake. <br>
That's why all of the parts of the Gospel need to be true, so that we can be forgiven and saved.<br>
1 Corinthians 15 verses 1 through 6 give us a very nice summary of what the Gospel is, the Good News.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 15 verses 1 through 6,  and then we will skip down to verses 10 through 17<br>
1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;<br>
2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<br>
3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br>
4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<br>
5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:<br>
6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once;....<br>
<br>
<br>
That was verse 6.  And now, skipping to verse 10...<br>
<br>
10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.<br>
11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.<br>
12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?<br>
13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:<br>
14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.<br>
15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.<br>
16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:<br>
17 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
1 Let me now remind you, dear brothers and sisters, of the Good News I preached to you before. You welcomed it then, and you still stand firm in it. <br>
2 It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you -- unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place, (unless you never believed it in the first place).<br>
3 I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. <br>
4 He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. <br>
5 He was seen by Peter, (in the Greek, his name was Cephas,) and then by the Twelve. <br>
6 After that, (he was seen by more than 500 of the brothers at one time,) he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time....<br>
<br>
Again in the NLT, stopping there in verse 6, and now, skipping to verse 10...<br>
<br>
10 But whatever I am now, it is all because God poured out his special favour on me -- and not without results. For I have worked harder than any of the other apostles; yet it was not I but God who was working through me by his grace. <br>
11 So it makes no difference whether I preach or they preach, for we all preach the same message you have already believed.<br>
12 But tell me this -- since we preach that Christ rose from the dead, why are some of you saying there will be no resurrection of the dead? <br>
13 For if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised either. <br>
14 And if Christ has not been raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your faith is useless. <br>
15And we apostles would all be lying about God—for we have said that God raised Christ from the grave. But that can't be true if there is no resurrection of the dead. <br>
16And if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised. <br>
17And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is useless and you are still guilty of your sins. <br>
<br>
Commentary:  The book of 1 Corinthians was written by Paul around the year 55 or 56 AD, which was only about 22 or 23 years after Jesus Christ died, was buried, and was Resurrected.<br>
By the time 1 Corinthians was published, there were about six books of the New Testament already written.  Those books were James, Galatians, Mark, Matthew, 1 Thessalonians, and 2 Thessalonians.<br>
Those New Testament books were already published by the time 1 Corinthians was released, and that was the order in which they were released.<br>
Right after 1 Corinthians was published, the book of Romans was released about a year later, also written by the Apostle Paul, which is why the book of Romans also has such a good presentation of the Gospel message, especially there in Romans 10:9.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let us take a good again at 1 Corinthians 15<br>
Here are verses 3 through 6 again...in KJV...<br>
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br>
4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<br>
5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:<br>
6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once;<br>
<br>
and in NLT...<br>
Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. <br>
4 He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. <br>
5 He was seen by Peter, (in the Greek, his name was Cephas,) and then by the Twelve. <br>
6 After that, (he was seen by more than 500 of the brothers at one time,) he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time....<br>
<br>
Many Christian Churches get the main content of their creeds, or statements of faith, from 1 Corinthians 15 verses 1 through 6.<br>
What is a creed?<br>
<br>
Creed:<br>
a set of beliefs or principles, a statement of the main points of Christian belief.<br>
A formal statement of Christian beliefs, especially the Apostles' Creed or the Nicene Creed.<br>
<br>
(Definitions of creed are from 2018 editions of the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, and Collins Dictionaries, and the following is from Wikipedia)<br>
<br>
The Nicene Creed<br>
was originally adopted in the city of Nicaea (present day Iznik, Turkey) by the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and amended in 381 AD.<br>
<br>
A creed (also known as a confession, symbol, or statement of faith) is a statement of the shared beliefs of a religious community.<br>

Ezekiel 3: 17 through 21 (KJV)<br>
17 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.<br>
18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.<br>
19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.<br>
20 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness (or righteousnesses) which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.<br>
21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 3: 17 through 21 (NLT)<br>
17 "Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for Israel. Whenever you receive a message from me, warn people immediately.<br>
18 If I warn the wicked, saying, 'You are under the penalty of death,' but you fail to deliver the warning, they will die in their sins. And I will hold you responsible for their deaths.<br>
19 If you warn them and they refuse to repent and keep on sinning, they will die in their sins. But you will have saved yourself because you obeyed me.<br>
20 "If righteous people turn away from their righteous behaviour and ignore the obstacles I put in their way, they will die. And if you do not warn them, they will die in their sins. None of their righteous acts will be remembered, and I will hold you responsible for their deaths.<br>
21 But if you warn righteous people not to sin and they listen to you and do not sin, they will live, and you will have saved yourself, too."<br>

Christmas<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Does the following describe a Christmas Tree?<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10: 3 - 5 (KJV)<br>
3 (For the statutes of the people are vanity. For the ordinances of the people are vanity.) For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.<br>
4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.<br>
5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10: 1 - 5 (NLT)<br>
1<br>
Hear the word that the Lord speaks to you, O Israel! <br>
2<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Do not act like the other nations,<br>
who try to read their future in the stars.<br>
Do not be afraid of their predictions,<br>
even though other nations are terrified by them.<br>
3<br>
Their ways are futile and foolish.<br>
They cut down a tree, and a craftsman carves an idol.<br>
4<br>
They decorate it with gold and silver<br>
and then fasten it securely with hammer and nails<br>
so it won't fall over.<br>
5<br>
Their gods are like<br>
helpless scarecrows in a cucumber field!<br>
They cannot speak,<br>
and they need to be carried because they cannot walk.<br>
Do not be afraid of such gods,<br>
for they can neither harm you nor do you any good."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When was Jesus born? Does the Bible tell us?  No, it does not.<br>
No one really knows. It was never recorded or documented.<br>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia (in 2018)...<br>
There is no recording that tells us the year that Jesus was born.<br>
Most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.<br>
As far as the month of Jesus' birth, it can be inferred to be summer or fall. <br>
Combining inferences from when shepherds would likely be in the fields, and working backwards from Zechariah's priestly service (John the Baptist's father) and its connections to Jesus' birth, this research would suggest a likely date of mid-September to early October.<br>
This would suggest the conception of Jesus might have been in December, but not his birth.<br>

2 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.<br>
3 For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.<br>

<br>
Moses and Esther<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are two commentaries that talk about Moses...<br>
<br>
Let's begin by looking at a part of a commentary by Cleland Thom...<br>
<br>
"What does God's training programme look like? Here's how it worked out for Moses.<br>
<br>
"He was abandoned by his family and then raised by Pharaoh's daughter in an environment polluted by sexual immorality and the occult. He was taught godless wisdom and worshipped the sun god.<br>
<br>
"His adopted grandfather, Pharaoh Ahmosis, was a dangerous despot who committed genocide by murdering hundreds of Hebrew babies. <br>
<br>
"He was probably more despicable than any tyrant on earth today. I wouldn't have left my baby with his daughter. Social services might have something to say.<br>
<br>
"But Moses was safe in the hands of the one true God, who used his ungodly upbringing to prepare him for his destiny.<br>
<br>
"Christian training emphasises courses, teachers, and diplomas. And I'm all for them. Our churches would be poorer without them. <br>
<br>
"But God's training programme can be unconventional, painful and difficult to figure out. <br>
<br>
"He designed yours before you were born."<br>
<br>
"He knew what your calling would look like and will use everything you've been through to equip you for your unique kingdom mission."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That was a selected part of a commentary from...<br>
<br>
Cleland Thom<br>
Leader, and founder of<br>
Baton Bearers (a ministry that started in May 2018)<br>
It is a Christian teaching and ministry about setting the captives free.<br>
Operating in the city of Chichester, England<br>
That commentary was published on Friday 21 September 2018<br>

Ephesians 2:10<br>
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. <br>
<br>
Psalms 139<br>

verse 16<br>
You saw me before I was born.<br>
Every day of my life was recorded in your book.<br>
Every moment was laid out<br>
before a single day had passed.<br>

Isaiah 61: 1-7<br>
1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;<br>
2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;<br>
3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.<br>
4 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.<br>
5 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and your vinedressers.<br>
6 But ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.<br>
7 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 61: 1-7<br>
NLT<br>
1<br>
The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon me,<br>
for the Lord has anointed me<br>
to bring good news to the poor.<br>
He has sent me to comfort the brokenhearted<br>
and to proclaim that captives will be released<br>
and prisoners will be freed (and the blind will see.)<br>
2<br>
He has sent me to tell those who mourn that the time of the Lord's favour has come,<br>
(He has sent me to tell those who mourn to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,)<br>
and with it, the day of God's anger against their enemies.<br>
3<br>
To all who mourn in Israel, (To all who mourn in Zion,)<br>
he will give a crown of beauty for ashes,<br>
a joyous blessing instead of mourning,<br>
festive praise instead of despair.<br>
In their righteousness, they will be like great oaks<br>
that the Lord has planted for his own glory.<br>
4<br>
They will rebuild the ancient ruins,<br>
repairing cities destroyed long ago.<br>
They will revive them,<br>
though they have been deserted for many generations.<br>

They will feed your flocks<br>
and plough your fields<br>
and tend your vineyards.<br>
6<br>
You will be called priests of the Lord,<br>
ministers of our God.<br>
You will feed on the treasures of the nations<br>
and boast in their riches.<br>

Instead of shame and dishonour,<br>
you will enjoy a double share of honour.<br>
You will possess a double portion of prosperity in your land,<br>

Here is another commentary that also talks about Moses, and some other famous heroes of the Bible...<br>

Some comments from Ibby Oke, a Youth Leader at<br>
Divine Iconz Youth Ministry<br>
London, England<br>
Published on Friday 10 August 2018<br>
<br>
<br>
Parts of a Commentary from Ibby Oke:<br>
"The past is not an excuse to stop you from fulfilling God's purpose for your life. Moses was a murderer, but yet God used him to lead the Israelites out of slavery. Rahab was a prostitute but found her way in the lineage of Jesus Christ. God's purpose for your life is not limited by your past!<br>
<br>
"If you study the book of Esther, you will realise that right from the beginning, Esther obtained favour in the sight of those around her, and eventually the king before she was made queen. Sometimes, we make excuses that we are not equipped for what God has called us for or we are not good enough, but God equips us with everything we need to fulfil purpose, we just need to take that step."<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13: 20 & 21, KJV:<br>
<br>
20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,<br>
21 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13: 20 & 21, NLT:<br>
20<br>
Now may the God of peace--<br>
who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus,<br>
the great Shepherd of the sheep,<br>
and ratified an eternal covenant with his blood--<br>
21<br>
may he equip you with all you need<br>
for doing his will.<br>
May he produce in you, (May he produce in us,)<br>
through the power of Jesus Christ,<br>
every good thing that is pleasing to him.<br>
All glory to him forever and ever! Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Continuing the selected parts of the commentary from Ibby Oke:<br>
<br>
"Esther finally understood her purpose for being queen and what she had been called to do. <br>
<br>
"Understanding the concept of fasting, Esther told all the Jews to fast with her and her maids too. When it comes to fulfilling purpose, fasting and prayer are essential. Certain things won't shift without fasting and praying.<br>
<br>
"Eventually, Esther found the courage to approach the king; Haman was hanged, and the Jews were saved. <br>
<br>
"Your character and your relationships are vital to your purpose. You might not necessarily know what your purpose is and that's okay. Your purpose is only revealed in God. So, invest in yourself, build your character and build your relationship with God. 
<br>
"You were made for such a time as this!"<br>
<br>
NLT of 2 Corinthians 5: verses 5, 6, and 7<br>
5 God himself has prepared us for this, and as a guarantee he has given us his Holy Spirit.<br>
6 So we are always confident, even though we know that as long as we live in these bodies we are not at home with the Lord. <br>
7 For we live by believing and not by seeing. <br>
<br>
Commentary: Since there was a brief mention of fasting in that commentary, let's look at two places where fasting was necessary along with prayer.<br>
We will look at that here, in just a moment.<br>
It's probably the same story being told by two different authors, Matthew and Mark.<br>
The Lord will may sometimes put the desire to fast into our hearts and tell us when it needs to be done on a case-by-case basis.<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast 6 of 7 is known as The Day of Atonement<br>
Celebrate the Day of Atonement nine days after the Festival of Trumpets.<br>
That would be on the tenth day of the seventh month; This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in September or October.<br>
It is celebrated today as Yom Kippur.<br>
You must observe it as an official day for holy assembly, a day to deny yourselves (a day to fast) and present special gifts to the Lord.<br>
<br>
We will look at the seven feasts a bit more when we get to Christian Essays 9.<br>
We will look at fasting some more when we get to Christian Essays 12.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 17:21 (KJV)<br>
Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.<br>
<br>
Matthew 17: 19-21<br>
NLT:<br>
19 Afterward the disciples asked Jesus privately, "Why couldn't we cast out that demon?"<br>
20 "You don't have enough faith," Jesus told them. "I tell you the truth, if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move. Nothing would be impossible.<br>
21 But this kind of demon won't leave except by prayer and fasting."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 9:29 (KJV)<br>
And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 9:26-29 NLT:<br>
26 Then the spirit screamed and threw the boy into another violent convulsion and left him. The boy appeared to be dead. A murmur ran through the crowd as people said, "He's dead."<br>
27 But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.<br>
28 Afterward, when Jesus was alone in the house with his disciples, they asked him, "Why couldn't we cast out that evil spirit?"<br>
29 Jesus replied, "This kind can be cast out only by prayer (by prayer and fasting)".<br>

Psalms 139<br>
<br>
KJV<br>
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.<br>
1 O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.<br>
2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.<br>
(Thou winnowest my path and my lying down.)<br>
3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.<br>
4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.<br>
5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.<br>
6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.<br>
7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?<br>
8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.<br>
9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;<br>
10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.<br>
11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.<br>
(Yea, the darkness darkeneth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: as is the darkness, so is the light both alike to thee.)<br>
12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.<br>
13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.<br>
14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well, (my soul knoweth greatly well) <br>
15 (My strength was not hid from thee, My body was not hid from thee) My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.<br>
16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, (all of them, my members were written, what days they should be fashioned,) which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.<br>
17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!<br>
18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.<br>
19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.<br>
20 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.<br>
21 Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?<br>
22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.<br>
23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:<br>
24 (And see if there be any way of pain in me, and see if there be any grief in me,) and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 139<br>
NLT<br>
For the choir director: A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
O Lord, you have examined my heart<br>
and know everything about me.<br>
2<br>
You know when I sit down or stand up.<br>
You know my thoughts even when I'm far away.<br>
3<br>
You see me when I travel<br>
and when I rest at home.<br>
You know everything I do.<br>
4<br>
You know what I am going to say<br>
even before I say it, Lord.<br>
5<br>
You go before me and follow me.<br>
You place your hand of blessing on my head.<br>
6<br>
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,<br>
too great for me to understand!<br>
7<br>
I can never escape from your Spirit!<br>
I can never get away from your presence!<br>
8<br>
If I go up to heaven, you are there;<br>
if I go down to the grave, (to Sheol,) you are there.<br>
9<br>
If I ride the wings of the morning,<br>
if I dwell by the farthest oceans,<br>
10<br>
even there your hand will guide me,<br>
and your strength will support me.<br>
11<br>
I could ask the darkness to hide me<br>
and the light around me to become night--<br>
12<br>
but even in darkness I cannot hide from you.<br>
To you the night shines as bright as day.<br>
Darkness and light are the same to you.<br>
13<br>
You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body<br>
and knit me together in my mother's womb.<br>
14<br>
Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex!<br>
Your workmanship is marvellous -- how well I know it.<br>
15<br>
You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion,<br>
as I was woven together in the dark of the womb.<br>
16<br>
You saw me before I was born.<br>
Every day of my life was recorded in your book.<br>
Every moment was laid out<br>
before a single day had passed.<br>
17<br>
How precious are your thoughts about me, (How precious to me are your thoughts,) O God.<br>
They cannot be numbered!<br>
18<br>
I can't even count them;<br>
they outnumber the grains of sand!<br>
And when I wake up,<br>
you are still with me!<br>
19<br>
O God, if only you would destroy the wicked!<br>
Get out of my life, you murderers!<br>
20<br>
They blaspheme you;<br>
your enemies misuse your name.<br>
21<br>
O Lord, shouldn't I hate those who hate you?<br>
Shouldn't I despise those who oppose you?<br>
22<br>
Yes, I hate them with total hatred,<br>
for your enemies are my enemies.<br>
23<br>
Search me, O God, and know my heart;<br>
test me and know my anxious thoughts.<br>
24<br>
Point out anything in me that offends you,<br>
and lead me along the path of everlasting life.<br>

2 Kings 6: verses 8 through 23, KJV<br>
The king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp (shall be my encamping).<br>
9 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.<br>
10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.<br>
11 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?<br>
12 And one of his servants said, (No,) None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.<br>
13 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.<br>
14 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a (heavy,) great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.<br>
15 And when (the minister,) the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?<br>
16 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.<br>
17 And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.<br>
18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.<br>
19 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: (come ye after me, and) follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria. <br>
20 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.<br>
21 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?<br>
22 And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.<br>
23 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.<br>
<br>
2 Kings 6: verses 8 through 23, NLT<br>
8 When the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he would confer with his officers and say, "We will mobilise our forces at such and such a place."<br>
9 But immediately Elisha, the man of God, would warn the king of Israel, "Do not go near that place, for the Arameans are planning to mobilise their troops there." <br>
10 So the king of Israel would send word to the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he would be on the alert there.<br>
11 The king of Aram became very upset over this. He called his officers together and demanded, "Which of you is the traitor? Who has been informing the king of Israel of my plans?"<br>
12 "It's not us, my lord the king," one of the officers replied. "Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in the privacy of your bedroom!"<br>
13 "Go and find out where he is," the king commanded, "so I can send troops to seize him."<br>
And the report came back: "Elisha is at Dothan." <br>
14 So one night the king of Aram sent a great army with many chariots and horses to surround the city.<br>
15 When the servant of the man of God got up early the next morning and went outside, there were troops, horses, and chariots everywhere. "Oh, sir, what will we do now?" the young man cried to Elisha.<br>
16 "Don't be afraid!" Elisha told him. "For there are more on our side than on theirs!" <br>
17 Then Elisha prayed, "O Lord, open his eyes and let him see!" The Lord opened the young man's eyes, and when he looked up, he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and chariots of fire.<br>
18 As the Aramean army advanced toward him, Elisha prayed, "O Lord, please make them blind." So the Lord struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked.<br>
19 Then Elisha went out and told them, "You have come the wrong way! This isn't the right city! Follow me, and I will take you to the man you are looking for." And he led them to the city of Samaria.<br>
20 As soon as they had entered Samaria, Elisha prayed, "O Lord, now open their eyes and let them see." So the Lord opened their eyes, and they discovered that they were in the middle of Samaria.<br>
21 When the king of Israel saw them, he shouted to Elisha, "My father, should I kill them? Should I kill them?"<br>
22 "Of course not!" Elisha replied. "Do we kill prisoners of war? Give them food and drink and send them home again to their master."<br>
23 So the king made a great feast for them and then sent them home to their master. After that, the Aramean raiders stayed away from the land of Israel.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There are hundreds and hundreds of amazing Christian hits that I would love to recommend that you take the time to listen to and enjoy.<br>
<br>
But, I'm just going to narrow it down to four that I would recommend most of all. There are many more, but these are four that I would say are a great example of very good Christian music.<br>
<br>
<br>
I wanted to mention these four Christian songs that have very powerful lyrics.<br>
These were all very popular Christian songs for years after they were released.<br>
As you may already know, you can easily play these songs for free right now by searching for them on YouTube, or other websites of that nature.<br>
<br>
<br>
I just wanted you to take a moment to consider the lyrics, since they are very powerful, and are very much in alignment with what the Bible teaches.<br>

<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the song, Oceans (Where Feet May Fail), from Hillsong United...<br>
<br>
You call me out upon the waters<br>
The great unknown where feet may fail<br>
And there I find You in the mystery<br>
In oceans deep<br>
My faith will stand<br>
<br>
And I will call upon Your name<br>
And keep my eyes above the waves<br>
When oceans rise<br>
My soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
For I am Yours and You are mine<br>
<br>
Your grace abounds in deepest waters<br>
Your sovereign hand<br>
Will be my guide<br>
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me<br>
You've never failed and You won't start now<br>
<br>
So I will call upon Your name<br>
And keep my eyes above the waves<br>
When oceans rise<br>
My soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
For I am Yours and You are mine<br>
And You are mine<br>
<br>
<br>
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
Let me walk upon the waters<br>
Wherever You would call me<br>
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
And my faith will be made stronger<br>
In the presence of my Saviour<br>
<br>
Oh, Jesus, you're my God!<br>
<br>
I will call upon Your name<br>
Keep my eyes above the waves<br>
My soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
I am Yours and You are mine<br>

Broken souls with smiling faces<br>
Fighting for surrender<br>
For now and the after<br>
Just look around and you'll see that people<br>
Are scared to say how they really feel, oh<br>
We all need a little honesty<br>
<br>
You are loved<br>
If your heart's in a thousand pieces<br>
If you're lost and you're far from reason<br>
Just look up, know you are loved<br>
Just look up, and know you are loved<br>
When it feels like somethings missing<br>
If it hurts but you can't find healing<br>
Just look up, know you are loved<br>
Just look up, know you are loved. ooh<br>
<br>
We're not made to be superheroes,<br>
Photoshopped, all size zeroes<br>
We're a light not expected<br>
But not quite perfected yet.<br>
Look up see the sun is shining<br>
There's hope on a new horizon<br>
Calling you, calling...<br>
<br>
You don't have to prove yourself<br>
Don't try to be someone else<br>
<br>

<br>
Here are the lyrics to the song, O'Lord, by Lauren Daigle...<br>
<br>
<br>
Whoa...<br>
<br>
Though times it seems<br>
Like I'm coming undone<br>
This walk can often feel lonely<br>
No matter what until this race is won<br>
I will stand my ground where hope can be found<br>
I will stand my ground where hope can be found<br>
<br>
Oh, O'Lord O'Lord I know You hear my cry<br>
Your love is lifting me above all the lies<br>
No matter what I face this I know in time<br>
You'll take all that is wrong and make it right<br>
You'll take all that is wrong and make it right<br>
<br>
<br>
Your strength is found<br>
At the end of my road<br>
Your grace it reaches to the hurting<br>
Still through the tears and the questioning why<br>
I will stand my ground where hope can be found!<br>
I will stand my ground where hope can be found!<br>
<br>
Oh, O'Lord O'Lord I know You hear my cry<br>
Your love is lifting me above all the lies<br>
No matter what I face This I know in time<br>
You'll take all that is wrong and make it right<br>
You'll take all that is wrong and make it right<br>
(Right, so Right)<br>
Make it Right,<br>
(Right so Right)<br>
Make it Right, Right<br>

Daniel 3<br>
1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.<br>
2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.<br>
3 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.<br>
4 Then an herald cried aloud (cried with might), To you (they command) it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,<br>
5 That (when you hear the sound of the singing, when you hear the sound of the symphony) at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:<br>
6 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.<br>
7 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.<br>
8 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.<br>
9 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.<br>
10 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, (when every man hears the sound of the singing, when every man hears the sound of the symphony) that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:<br>
11 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.<br>
12 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee (have set no regard upon thee): they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.<br>
13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego. Then they brought these men before the king.<br>
14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true (have you done this on purpose, or, is it of purpose), O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?<br>
15 Now if ye be ready that (when you hear the sound of the singing, when you hear the sound of the symphony) at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?<br>
16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.<br>
17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.<br>
18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.<br>
19 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury (filled with fury), and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.<br>
20 And he commanded the most mighty men (the men that were mighty of strength) that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.<br>
21 Then these men were bound in their coats (bound in their mantleshats,) their hosen, and their hats (their turbans), and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.<br>
22 Therefore because (the king's word,) because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, (the spark of the fire,) the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego.<br>
23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.<br>
24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said (unto his governors,) unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.<br>
25 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt, (there is no hurt in them); and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.<br>
26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near (to the furnace door) to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.<br>
27 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.<br>
28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.<br>
29 (Therefore, a decree is made by me.) Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, (which speak in error,) which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, shall be cut in pieces (made into pieces), and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.<br>
30 Then the king promoted (them, and they were made to prosper.) The king promoted to prosper Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed–nego, in the province of Babylon.<br>

Daniel 3<br>
NLT:<br>
1 King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue ninety feet tall and nine feet wide<br>
(60 cubits tall and 6 cubits wide, or 27 metres tall and 2.7 metres wide) and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. <br>
2 Then he sent messages to the high officers, officials, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the provincial officials to come to the dedication of the statue he had set up. <br>
3 So (all of the high officers, officials, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the provincial officials,) all these officials, came and stood before the statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.<br>
4 Then a herald shouted out, "People of all races and nations and languages, listen to the king's command! <br>
5 When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and other musical instruments, bow to the ground to worship King Nebuchadnezzar's gold statue. <br>
(The identification of some of these musical instruments is uncertain.)<br>
<br>
6 Anyone who refuses to obey will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace."<br>
7 So at the sound of the musical instruments, (the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and other musical instruments) all the people, whatever their race or nation or language, bowed to the ground and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.<br>
8 But some of the astrologers, (some of the Chaldeans) went to the king and informed on the Jews. <br>
9 They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "Long live the king! <br>
10 You issued a decree requiring all the people to bow down and worship the gold statue when they hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and other musical instruments. <br>
11 That decree also states that those who refuse to obey must be thrown into a blazing furnace. <br>
12 But there are some Jews--Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego--whom you have put in charge of the province of Babylon. They pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They refuse to serve your gods and do not worship the gold statue you have set up."<br>
13 Then Nebuchadnezzar flew into a rage and ordered that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought before him. When they were brought in, <br>
14 Nebuchadnezzar said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you refuse to serve my gods or to worship the gold statue I have set up? <br>
15 I will give you one more chance to bow down and worship the statue I have made when you hear the sound of the musical instruments, (the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and other musical instruments.) But if you refuse, you will be thrown immediately into the blazing furnace. And then what god will be able to rescue you from my power?"<br>
16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you. <br>
17 If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty. <br>
18 But even if he doesn't, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up."<br>
19 Nebuchadnezzar was so furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face became distorted with rage. He commanded that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual. <br>
20 Then he ordered some of the strongest men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. <br>
21 So they tied them up and threw them into the furnace, fully dressed in their pants, turbans, robes, and other garments. <br>
22 And because the king, in his anger, had demanded such a hot fire in the furnace, the flames killed the soldiers as they threw the three men in. <br>
23 So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, securely tied, fell into the roaring flames.<br>
24 But suddenly, Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and exclaimed to his advisers, "Didn't we tie up three men and throw them into the furnace?"<br>
"Yes, Your Majesty, we certainly did," they replied.<br>
25 "Look!" Nebuchadnezzar shouted. "I see four men, unbound, walking around in the fire unharmed! And the fourth looks like a god (or like a son of the gods)!"<br>
26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could to the door of the flaming furnace and shouted: "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!"<br>
So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stepped out of the fire. <br>
27 Then the high officers, officials, governors, and advisers crowded around them and saw that the fire had not touched them. Not a hair on their heads was singed, and their clothing was not scorched. They didn't even smell of smoke!<br>
28 Then Nebuchadnezzar said, "Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel to rescue his servants who trusted in him. They defied the king's command and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. <br>
29 Therefore, I make this decree: If any people, whatever their race or nation or language, speak a word against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they will be torn limb from limb, and their houses will be turned into heaps of rubble. There is no other god who can rescue like this!"<br>
30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to even higher positions in the province of Babylon.<br>

Isaiah 40 (KJV) -- 28 through 31 (the end of Chapter 40)<br>
28 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.<br>
29 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.<br>
30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:<br>
31 But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 40 (NLT) -- verses 25 through 31<br>
25<br>
"To whom will you compare me?<br>
Who is my equal?" asks the Holy One.<br>
26<br>
Look up into the heavens.<br>
Who created all the stars?<br>
He brings them out like an army, one after another,<br>
calling each by its name.<br>
Because of his great power and incomparable strength,<br>
not a single one is missing.<br>
27<br>
O Jacob, how can you say the Lord does not see your troubles?<br>
O Israel, how can you say God ignores your rights?<br>
28<br>
Have you never heard?<br>
Have you never understood?<br>
The Lord is the everlasting God,<br>
the Creator of all the earth.<br>
He never grows weak or weary.<br>
No one can measure the depths of his understanding.<br>
29<br>
He gives power to the weak<br>
and strength to the powerless.<br>
30<br>
Even youths will become weak and tired,<br>
and young men will fall in exhaustion.<br>
31<br>
But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength.<br>
They will soar high on wings like eagles.<br>
They will run and not grow weary.<br>
They will walk and not faint.<br>

"I Just Need U" by TobyMac <br>
<br>
<br>
Last night put the heavy on me<br>
Woke up and I'm feeling lonely<br>
This world gotta a way of showing me (showing me)<br>
Some days it'll lift you up<br>
Some days it'll call your bluff<br>
Man, most of my days I ain't got enough<br>
<br>
And all I know<br>
Is You're my only hope<br>
<br>
When I'm up when I'm down (uh, huh)<br>
When the wolves come around (tell me)<br>
When my feet hit the ground<br>
I just need, I just need You<br>
On my darkest days (uh, huh)<br>
When I'm losing faith (tell me)<br>
No, it ain't gon' change<br>
I just need, I just need You<br>
Lord, I need You<br>
Yeah, I just need You<br>
<br>
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death<br>
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me<br>
Thy rod and thy staff<br>
<br>
They comfort me when I'm beat down, broken<br>
Hold my heart when it's split wide open<br>
Turn these eyes to my sole protector<br>
Break the will of this born defector<br>
<br>
Cuz' all I know, all I know<br>
Is You're my only hope<br>
<br>
When I'm up when I'm down (uh, huh)<br>
When the wolves come around (tell me)<br>
When my feet hit the ground<br>
I just need, I just need You<br>
On my darkest days (uh, huh)<br>
When I'm losing faith (tell me)<br>

Lord, I need You<br>
Yeah, I just need You<br>

When You pull me closer, I come to life<br>
When You pull me closer, I come to life<br>
When You pull me closer, I come to life<br>
When You pull me closer, I come to life<br>
<br>

Commentary:<br>
Psalms 120-134 are fifteen Psalms that are known as Songs of the Ascents, Gradual Psalms, Songs of Degrees, Songs of Steps or Pilgrim Songs.<br>
They were sung by worshippers as they ascended the road to Jerusalem to attend the three pilgrim festivals indicated in Deuteronomy 16:16.<br>
Deuteronomy 16, verses 16 & 17 indicate that every man was required to go and do this, bringing a gift, and must give as they are able, according to the blessings given to them by the Lord your God.<br>
Those three pilgrim festivals are when people, especially the men, would make a pilgrimage up to the Temple in Jerusalem.<br>
The three pilgrim festivals are known as, Passover; the Festival of Harvest, Weeks or Pentecost; and the Festival of Tabernacles, Tents, Booths, or Shelters.<br>
Let's read one of these Songs of Degrees right now.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 127<br>
all of Psalms 127, all 5 verses, KJV<br>
<br>
(A Song of degrees of Solomon.)<br>
A Song of degrees for Solomon.<br>
(Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that are builders of it in it.)<br>
1 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.<br>
2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.<br>
3 Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.<br>
4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.<br>
<br>
(Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them. They shall not be ashamed, but they shall subdue and destroy the enemies in the gate.)<br>
5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 127<br>
all of Psalms 127, all 5 verses, NLT<br>
A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. A psalm of Solomon.<br>
1<br>
Unless the Lord builds a house,<br>
the work of the builders is wasted.<br>
Unless the Lord protects a city,<br>
guarding it with sentries will do no good.<br>
2<br>
It is useless for you to work so hard<br>
from early morning until late at night,<br>
anxiously working for food to eat;<br>
for God gives rest to his loved ones.<br>
3<br>
Children are a gift from the Lord;<br>
they are a reward from him.<br>
4<br>
Children born to a young man<br>
are like arrows in a warrior’s hands.<br>
5<br>
How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them!<br>
He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates.<br>

Enoch Samples<br>
<br>
The Book of Enoch contains about 105 to 107 chapters. Different translators numbered some of the chapters slightly different, causing some chapter number locations to not be in agreement with different English translations.<br>
<br>
Here is a short outline of the Book of Enoch.<br>
The Book of Enoch has five main sections...<br>
Section 1 of 5. Book of the Watchers (chapters 1-36) rewards, punishment, the end of the world and final judgement, angels, the Tree of Life, Jerusalem, and the universe<br>
Section 2 of 5. Book of the Similitudes (chapters 37-71) Messiah, resurrection, the flood, Noah, future judgement, and paradise.<br>
Section 3 of 5. Book of the Astronomical Writings (chapters 72-82) stars, moon, astronomy, the universe, and Enoch's mission<br>
Section 4 of 5. Book of the Dream Visions (chapters 83-90) the flood, a historical sketch, the future of Israel, and the Messianic kingdom<br>
Section 5 of 5. Book of the Epistle of Enoch (chapters 91-107) challenges for the wicked and righteous, the sin after the flood until the coming of the Messiah<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a small sample of verses from the Book of Enoch.<br>
These seven selections were chosen by Dr Stephen Pidgeon in May 2020, as being some of the most important and significant verses in the the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
We are going to be saying some Hebrew words in this study of Scripture.<br>
<br>
The previously lost Book of Enoch is not in the Holy Bible today, but many experts believe that it used to be.<br>
And several experts may argue that it should be put back into the Bible.<br>
Right now, we are getting near the end of Christian Essays 4.<br>
Some day later on, when we get to Christian Essays 7, we will see that the Book of Enoch is mentioned and even quoted in the Holy Bible that we all have today.<br>
Some people have even suggested that, several verses throughout the New Testament are actually quoting from the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew words in this study are written in English in such a way so that they are easy to pronounce accurately.<br>
They are not spelled correctly, in the way how they normally are spelled with English characters.<br>
Instead, they are spelled in a way that makes it easy to speak out the Hebrew words correctly.<br>
<br>
God, in Hebrew, is EE-Low-Heem<br>
(EE-Low-Heem) means, God.<br>
But, the Lord is not the actual name of our Heavenly Father God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.<br>
<br>
The actual name of our God, the Lord is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 9:6 KJV<br>
6 Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 9:6 NLT<br>
6 "You alone are the Lord. You made the skies and the heavens and all the stars. You made the earth and the seas and everything in them. You preserve them all, and the angels of heaven worship you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:1 KJV<br>
1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:1 NLT<br>
1 So the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything in them was completed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 9:35 KJV<br>
35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.<br>
<br>
Luke 9:35 NLT<br>
35 Then a voice from the cloud said, (This is my dearly loved Son.) "This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen to him."<br>
<br>
Luke 9:35 shows how Jesus Christ is the chosen one, the elect one, the elect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat, which is, the Lord of Hosts can also mean, God of Hosts, Lord Yaw-Who-Wah God of Hosts, The Lord of Armies, The Lord of Heaven's Armies, The Lord of the Angel Armies, and the God of the Armies of Heaven.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, The Lord of Hosts is the Lord God.<br>
In Hebrew, The Lord of Hosts is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat.<br>
So, every time there was the Hebrew words, Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat, we use the English term, The Lord of Hosts.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the book of Enoch, Jesus Christ is referred to as, The Elect One, The Elect.<br>
The Hebrew way of saying Jesus Christ, is, Yaw-Who-Shaw.  Other similar pronunciations would include, Yeh-Shoe-Uh, or Yaw-Shoe-Uh, or Yaw-Who-Shuh.<br>
We will put Yaw-Who-Shaw next to the Elect, to remind us that the chosen one, the elect one is Jesus Christ.<br>
Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw, is The Elect One, The Son of Man, The Righteous One, Messiah, the Son of the Most High God.<br>
<br>
Eth is pronounced, eht, as in the word, set, without the s sound.<br>
<br>
