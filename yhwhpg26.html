When we were in Christian Essays 4, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 4.<br>
We did a Bible study, titled,<br>
Christmas<br>
It mainly looked at<br>
Jeremiah chapter 10, verses 1 through 5.<br>
In that area of Scripture, the Bible basically tells us two things.<br>
1. The statutes of the people, the ordinances of the people, the customs of the people are vain, vanity, futile and foolish.<br>
2. Christmas can neither harm you nor do you any good, and the people that do Christmas don't have it in them to do good.<br>
So, my question once again is, if Christmas does not do you any good, according to the Holy Bible, the Word of God, why waste your time and money having anything to do with something that cannot do you any good?<br>
<br>
Repeating again the Commentary from this previous Christmas Bible study in Christian Essays 4:<br>
Commentary:<br>
When was Jesus born? Does the Bible tell us? No, it does not.<br>
No one really knows. It was never recorded or documented.<br>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia (in 2018)...<br>
There is no recording that tells us the year that Jesus was born.<br>
Most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.<br>
As far as the month of Jesus' birth, it can be inferred to be summer or fall.<br>
Combining inferences from when shepherds would likely be in the fields, and working backwards from Zechariah's priestly service (John the Baptist's father) and its connections to Jesus' birth, this research would suggest a likely date of mid-September to early October.<br>
This would suggest the conception of Jesus might have been in December, but not his birth.<br>
<br>
Let's just be clear right now, his possible month of birth was not anywhere near the 25th of December.<br>
That date is a lie from satan.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have found a webpage that explains this birth month estimation in greater detail.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am going to read to you now some paragraphs from...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/when-was-jesus-born">https://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/when-was-jesus-born</a><br>
<br>
<br>
This is what that bibleinfo.com webpage said in October 2021...<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look at what the Bible says in Luke 2:8-9. "Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid."<br>
<br>
According to Bible commentator Adam Clarke, it was customary for the Jews to send their sheep to pasture from the spring until early October. As the cold winter months began, the flocks would return from the fields for shelter and warmth. Since the shepherds were still tending their flocks in the fields around Bethlehem it can be concluded that the angels announced the news of Jesus' birth no later than October.<br>
<br>
We can find some additional clues to answer the question of "when was Jesus really born" by looking at the birth of John the Baptist. Luke 1 tells of Zacharias, who was from the priestly order of Abijah, and his barren wife, Elizabeth, becoming pregnant with John the Baptist after his days of service in the temple. In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, Gabriel visited Mary with the news that she would give birth to Jesus. The approximate month of Jesus' birth can thus be determined by counting from the date of Zacharias' priestly service until the birth of Jesus.<br>
<br>
Jewish priests were divided into 24 courses which ministered throughout the year in the temple. The order of Abijah was the eighth priestly course (1 Chronicles 24:6-19) which served in the temple during the 10th week of the priestly cycle. The start of the 10th week coincided with the second Sabbath in the month of Sivan, which runs approximately from mid-May to mid-June. Soon after Zechariah returned from his priestly duties Elizabeth became pregnant with John the Baptist.<br>
<br>
Luke 1:24-28, 31 records these events, "Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying, 'Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in the days when He looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.' Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary. And having come in, the angel said to her, 'Rejoice, highly favoured one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!'...And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus."<br>
<br>
We can approximate the month of Jesus' birth to be around the time of Tishri (mid to late September). To arrive at this date, start at the conception of John the Baptist, Sivan (June), count forward six months to arrive at Gabriel's announcement of the conception of Jesus, Kislev (December), then count forward nine more months, the time it takes for human gestation, to reach Tishri (September), when Jesus was born.<br>
<br>
The exact date of Jesus' birth may not be known, but we can rest assured that Jesus died for our sins (Galatians 3:13), rose again (1 Corinthians 15:3-6), and that He will one day come back to take us to heaven (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).<br>
<br>
<br>
And that is the end of the quoted paragraphs from the bibleinfo.com website.<br>
<br>
Let's look at those Bible verses that were mentioned.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 2: 7-11 KJV<br>
2:7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.<br>	 		 
2:8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.<br>
(keeping the night watches over their flock by night.)<br>
<br>
2:9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.<br>
2:10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.<br>
2:11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 2: 7-11 NLT<br>
7 She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them.<br>
8 That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep.<br>
9 Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them, and the radiance of the Lord's glory surrounded them. They were terrified,<br>
10 but the angel reassured them. "Don't be afraid!" he said. "I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people.<br>
11 The Saviour -- yes, the Messiah, the Lord -- has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David!<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 2: 7-11 TS2009<br>
7 And she gave birth to her first-born Son, and wrapped Him up, and laid Him down in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in a lodging place.<br>
8 And in the same country there were shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.<br>
9 And look, a messenger of Yaw-Who-Wah stood before them, and the esteem of Yaw-Who-Wah shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.<br>
10 And the messenger said to them, “Do not be afraid, for look, I bring you good news of great joy which shall be to all people.<br>
11 "Because there was born to you today in the city of David a Saviour, who is Messiah, the Master.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 24:6-19 KJV<br>
24:6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites:<br>
(one house of the father being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.)<br>
one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.<br>
24:7 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,<br>
24:8 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,<br>
24:9 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,<br>
24:10 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,<br>
24:11 The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah,<br>
24:12 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,<br>
24:13 The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,<br>
24:14 The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,<br>
24:15 The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,<br>
24:16 The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,<br>
24:17 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,<br>
24:18 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.<br>
24:19 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 24:6-19 NLT<br>
6<br>
Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, acted as secretary and wrote down the names and assignments in the presence of the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the family leaders of the priests and Levites. The descendants of Eleazar and Ithamar took turns casting lots.<br>
7<br>
The first lot fell to Jehoiarib.<br>
The second lot fell to Jedaiah.<br>
8<br>
The third lot fell to Harim.<br>
The fourth lot fell to Seorim.<br>
9<br>
The fifth lot fell to Malkijah.<br>
The sixth lot fell to Mijamin.<br>
10<br>
The seventh lot fell to Hakkoz.<br>
The eighth lot fell to Abijah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
We have stopped here at verse 10.<br>
We just read, in verse 10,<br>
The eighth lot fell to Abijah.<br>
Zechariah was a member of the priestly order of Abijah.<br>
Zechariah is the Jewish priest that will have a son that will be known as John the Baptist.<br>
The time of year when it was Zechariah's turn to be serving God in the Temple is one of the factors that helps to estimate the time of year when Jesus was born.<br>
<br>
<br>
11<br>
The ninth lot fell to Jeshua.<br>
The tenth lot fell to Shecaniah.<br>
12<br>

The twenty-first lot fell to Jakin.<br>
The twenty-second lot fell to Gamul.<br>
18<br>
The twenty-third lot fell to Delaiah.<br>
The twenty-fourth lot fell to Maaziah.<br>
19<br>
Each group carried out its appointed duties in the house of the Lord according to the procedures established by their ancestor Aaron in obedience to the commands of the Lord, the God of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 1: 23-31 KJV<br>
1:23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.<br>
1:24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,<br>
1:25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.<br>
1:26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,<br>
1:27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.<br>
1:28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.<br>
(Hail, thou that art graciously accepted, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.)<br>
(Hail, thou that art much graced, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.)<br>
<br>
1:29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.<br>
1:30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.<br>
1:31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.<br>
<br>
Luke 1: 23-31 NLT<br>
23 When Zechariah's week of service in the Temple was over, he returned home.<br>
24 Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months.<br>
25 "How kind the Lord is!" she exclaimed. "He has taken away my disgrace of having no children."<br>
26 In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee,<br>
27 to a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David.<br>
28 Gabriel appeared to her and said, "Greetings, favoured woman! The Lord is with you!"<br>
("Rejoice, favoured woman! The Lord is with you! Blessed are you among women.")<br>
<br>
29 Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean.<br>
30 "Don't be afraid, Mary," the angel told her, "for you have found favour with God!<br>
31 You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Elohim is pronounced, EE-low-Heem.<br>
EE-low-Heem is the Hebrew word for, God.<br>
<br>
Luke 1: 23-31 TS2009<br>
23 And it came to be, as soon as the days of his service were completed, he went away to his house.<br>
24 And after those days his wife Elisheba conceived. And she hid herself five months, saying,<br>
25 Yaw-Who-Wah has done this for me, in the days when He looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.<br>
26 And in the sixth month the messenger Gabriel was sent by Elohim to a city of Galil named Natsareth,<br>
27 to a maiden engaged to a man whose name was Yoseph, of the house of David. And the maiden's name was Miryam.<br>
28 And the messenger, coming to her, said, "Greetings, favoured one, the Master is with you. Blessed are you among women!"<br>
29 But she was greatly disturbed at his word, and wondered what kind of greeting this was.<br>
30 And the messenger said to her, "Do not be afraid, Miryam, for you have found favour with Elohim.<br>
31 And see, you shall conceive in your womb, and shall give birth to a Son, and call His Name Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 3:13 KJV<br>
3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 3:13 NLT<br>
13 But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law. When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing. For it is written in the Scriptures, "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree."<br>
(Quoting from the Greek version of Deuteronomy 21:23)<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 21: 22 & 23 NLT<br>
22 "If someone has committed a crime worthy of death and is executed and hung on a tree, (or impaled on a pole,)<br>
23 the body must not remain hanging from the tree overnight. You must bury the body that same day, for anyone who is hung is cursed in the sight of God.<br>
(The Greek version says, in verse 23, You must bury the body that same day, for everyone who is hung on a tree is cursed in the sight of God.)<br>

In this way, you will prevent the defilement of the land the Lord your God is giving you as your special possession.<br>

O Lord, I give my life to you.<br>

I trust in you, my God!<br>
Do not let me be disgraced,<br>
or let my enemies rejoice in my defeat.<br>
3<br>
No one who trusts in you will ever be disgraced,<br>

Show me the right path, O Lord;<br>
point out the road for me to follow.<br>
5<br>
Lead me by your truth and teach me,<br>
for you are the God who saves me.<br>
All day long I put my hope in you.<br>

7<br>
Do not remember the rebellious sins of my youth.<br>
Remember me in the light of your unfailing love,<br>
for you are merciful, O Lord.<br>
8<br>
The Lord is good and does what is right;<br>
he shows the proper path to those who go astray.<br>
9<br>
He leads the humble in doing right,<br>
teaching them his way.<br>
10<br>
The Lord leads with unfailing love and faithfulness<br>
all who keep his covenant and obey his demands.<br>
11<br>
For the honour of your name, O Lord,<br>
forgive my many, many sins.<br>
12<br>
Who are those who fear the Lord?<br>
He will show them the path they should choose.<br>
13<br>
They will live in prosperity,<br>
and their children will inherit the land.<br>
14<br>
The Lord is a friend to those who fear him.<br>
He teaches them his covenant.<br>
15<br>
My eyes are always on the Lord,<br>
for he rescues me from the traps of my enemies.<br>
16<br>

Forgive all my sins.<br>

Do not let me be disgraced, for in you I take refuge.<br>

<br>
This psalm is a Hebrew acrostic poem; each verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
In this TS2009 translation, at the beginning of each verse, there is an attempt to pronounce each letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
The sixth Hebrew letter, shown in verse 5, spelled w a w, is shown in round brackets in the TS2009 translation within verse 5, and may have been pronounced, wah-oo, but, today, that same letter is now pronounced, Vahv.<br>
The Hebrew letter pronunciations provided here are approximate due to the limitations of the English language.<br>

Who, then, is the man that fears Yaw-Who-Wah? He teaches him in the way he should choose.<br>
13 Noon<br>
His life dwells in good, And his seed inherits the earth.<br>
14 Salmick<br>
The secret of Yaw-Who-Wah is with those who fear Him, And He makes His covenant known to them.<br>
15 Ian<br>
My eyes are ever toward Yaw-Who-Wah, For He brings my feet out of the net.<br>
16 Pay<br>
Turn Your face to me, and show me favour, For I am lonely and afflicted.<br>

The distresses of my heart have enlarged; Oh, bring me out of my distresses!<br>

Oh, guard my life, and deliver me; Let me not be ashamed, for I have taken refuge in You.<br>
21 Tov<br>
Let integrity and straightness guard me, For I have waited for You.<br>
22 Redeem Israel (Yis-Rye-ELL), O EE-Low-Heem, Out of all his distresses!<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: As mentioned on previous occasions, the Targumic Texts are paraphrased translations.<br>
They were mainly done by memorising books of the Hebrew Bible, and then creating a paraphrased translation, usually into the Aramaic language,<br>
that was used among the Arameans in the ancient region of Syria.<br>
Then, these Aramaic translations are then translated again for us into English.<br>
The translator frequently expanded his paraphrased-from-memory translation with expanded teachings, paraphrases, explanations, commentaries and examples that are not part of the original Torah, the original Hebrew Bible.<br>
A Targum can be kind of like a Bible study with sermon notes added in, from a sermon that was many centuries ago.<br>
<br>
Referring again to the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries,<br>
in October 2021, we went to those online Dictionaries to look at, combine and merge together their word definitions<br>
for the word, rapacious.<br>
rapacious means,<br>
wanting more money or goods than you need or have a right to,<br>
always wanting more money, goods etc than you need or have a right to,<br>
greedy,<br>
greedy and grasping, especially for money.<br>
a type of animal or bird that gets its food by catching prey.<br>
Having or showing a strong wish to take things for yourself, usually using unfair methods or force.<br>
If you describe a person or their behaviour as rapacious, you disapprove of their greedy or selfish behaviour.<br>
<br>
So, we can say that the rapacious are greedy, selfish people.<br>
<br>
This word, rapacious, is used in the Targum that we are about to read, in verse 19.<br>

In the autumn of 2021, my daughter made a beautiful painting of the sun in the sky, reflecting upon water, with trees and hills in the distance.<br>
Across the painting, she quotes Psalms 37: verses 5,6,7.<br>
<br>
Psalms 37: verses 5,6,7 -- TS2009, with parts of the KJV in verses 5 and 6.<br>
5<br>
Commit your way to Yaw-Who-Wah, And trust in Him, and he shall bring it to pass.<br>

And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgement as the noonday.<br>

Rest in Yaw-Who-Wah, and wait patiently for Him....<br>

Psalms 37 -- All of Psalms 37, all 40 verses -- KJV<br>
<br>
37:1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.<br>
37:2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.<br>
37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land,<br>
and verily thou shalt be fed.<br>
(in truth and stableness thou shalt be fed.)<br>
<br>
37:4 Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.<br>
(Roll thy way upon the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.)<br>
37:5 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.<br>
<br>
37:6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgement as the noonday.<br>
<br>
(Be silent to the LORD, and wait patiently for him,)<br>
37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.<br>
37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.<br>
37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.<br>
37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.<br>
37:11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br>
<br>
(The wicked practiseth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.)<br>
37:12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.<br>
37:13 The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.<br>
37:14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.<br>
(and to slay the upright of way.)<br>
<br>
37:15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.<br>
37:16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.<br>
37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.<br>
37:18 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.<br>
37:19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.<br>
37:20 But the wicked shall perish,<br>
(and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the the preciousness of Lambs,)<br>
and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.<br>
37:21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.<br>
37:22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.<br>
(The steps of a good man are established by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.)<br>
37:23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.<br>
37:24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.<br>
37:25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.<br>
(He is all the day merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.)<br>
37:26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.<br>
37:27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.<br>
37:28 For the LORD loveth judgement, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.<br>
37:30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgement.<br>
37:31 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.<br>
37:32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.<br>
37:33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.<br>
37:34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.<br>
37:35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.<br>
(I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green tree, that groweth in his own soil.)<br>
37:36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.<br>
37:37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.<br>
37:38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
37:39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.<br>
37:40 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.<br>

Psalms 37 -- All of Psalms 37, all 40 verses -- NLT<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
Don't worry about the wicked<br>
or envy those who do wrong.<br>
2<br>
For like grass, they soon fade away.<br>
Like spring flowers, they soon wither.<br>
3<br>
Trust in the Lord and do good.<br>
Then you will live safely in the land and prosper.<br>
4<br>
Take delight in the Lord,<br>
and he will give you your heart's desires.<br>
5<br>
Commit everything you do to the Lord.<br>
Trust him, and he will help you.<br>
6<br>
He will make your innocence radiate like the dawn,<br>
and the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun.<br>
7<br>
Be still in the presence of the Lord,<br>
and wait patiently for him to act.<br>
Don't worry about evil people who prosper<br>
or fret about their wicked schemes.<br>
8<br>
Stop being angry!<br>
Turn from your rage!<br>
Do not lose your temper --<br>
it only leads to harm.<br>
9<br>
For the wicked will be destroyed,<br>
but those who trust in the Lord will possess the land.<br>
10<br>
Soon the wicked will disappear.<br>
Though you look for them, they will be gone.<br>
11<br>
The lowly will possess the land<br>
and will live in peace and prosperity.<br>
12<br>
The wicked plot against the godly;<br>
they snarl at them in defiance.<br>
13<br>
But the Lord just laughs,<br>
for he sees their day of judgement coming.<br>
14<br>
The wicked draw their swords<br>
and string their bows<br>
to kill the poor and the oppressed,<br>
to slaughter those who do right.<br>
15<br>
But their swords will stab their own hearts,<br>
and their bows will be broken.<br>
16<br>
It is better to be godly and have little<br>
than to be evil and rich.<br>
17<br>
For the strength of the wicked will be shattered,<br>
but the Lord takes care of the godly.<br>
18<br>
Day by day the Lord takes care of the innocent,<br>
and they will receive an inheritance that lasts forever.<br>
19<br>
They will not be disgraced in hard times;<br>
even in famine they will have more than enough.<br>
20<br>
But the wicked will die.<br>
The Lord's enemies are like flowers in a field --<br>
they will disappear like smoke.<br>
21<br>
The wicked borrow and never repay,<br>
but the godly are generous givers.<br>
22<br>
Those the Lord blesses will possess the land,<br>
but those he curses will die.<br>
23<br>
The Lord directs the steps of the godly.<br>
He delights in every detail of their lives.<br>
24<br>
Though they stumble, they will never fall,<br>
for the Lord holds them by the hand.<br>
25<br>
Once I was young, and now I am old.<br>
Yet I have never seen the godly abandoned<br>
or their children begging for bread.<br>
26<br>
The godly always give generous loans to others,<br>
and their children are a blessing.<br>
27<br>
Turn from evil and do good,<br>
and you will live in the land forever.<br>
28<br>
For the Lord loves justice,<br>
and he will never abandon the godly.<br>
He will keep them safe forever,<br>
but the children of the wicked will die.<br>
29<br>
The godly will possess the land<br>
and will live there forever.<br>
30<br>
The godly offer good counsel;<br>
they teach right from wrong.<br>
31<br>
They have made God's law their own,<br>
so they will never slip from his path.<br>
32<br>
The wicked wait in ambush for the godly,<br>
looking for an excuse to kill them.<br>
33<br>
But the Lord will not let the wicked succeed<br>
or let the godly be condemned when they are put on trial.<br>
34<br>
Put your hope in the Lord.<br>
Travel steadily along his path.<br>
He will honour you by giving you the land.<br>
You will see the wicked destroyed.<br>
35<br>
I have seen wicked and ruthless people<br>
flourishing like a tree in its native soil.<br>
36<br>
But when I looked again, they were gone!<br>
Though I searched for them, I could not find them!<br>
37<br>
Look at those who are honest and good,<br>
for a wonderful future awaits those who love peace.<br>
38<br>
But the rebellious will be destroyed;<br>
they have no future.<br>
39<br>
The Lord rescues the godly;<br>
he is their fortress in times of trouble.<br>
40<br>
The Lord helps them,<br>
rescuing them from the wicked.<br>
He saves them,<br>
and they find shelter in him.<br>
<br>

Psalms 37 -- All of Psalms 37, all 40 verses -- TS2009<br>
This psalm is a Hebrew acrostic poem; every other verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
In this TS2009 translation, at the beginning of about every other verse, there is an attempt to pronounce each letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
The Hebrew letter pronunciations provided here are approximate due to the limitations of the English language.<br>
(PSALMS) 37<br>
1 All-if<br>
Do not fret because of evil-doers, Do not be envious of the workers of unrighteousness.<br>
2<br>
For they soon wither like grass, And fade like green plants.<br>
3 Bet<br>
Trust in Yaw-Who-Wah, and do good; Dwell in the earth, and feed on steadfastness.<br>
4<br>
And delight yourself in Yaw-Who-Wah, And let Him give you the desires of your heart.<br>
5 Gimmel<br>
Commit your way to Yaw-Who-Wah, And trust in Him, and He does it.<br>
6<br>
And He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, And your right-ruling as midday.<br>
7 Doll-it<br> 
Rest in Yaw-Who-Wah, and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man doing wicked devices.<br>
8 Hey<br>
Abstain from displeasure, and forsake wrath; Do not fret, also to do evil.<br>
9<br>
For evil-doers are cut off; But those who wait on Yaw-Who-Wah, They shall inherit the earth.<br>
10 Wah-oo (today, that same Hebrew letter is now pronounced, Vahv)<br>
Yet a little while and the wrong is no more; And you shall look on his place, But it is not.<br>
11<br>
But the meek ones shall inherit the earth, And delight themselves in plenty of peace.<br>
12 Zian<br> 
The wrong plots against the righteous, And gnashes his teeth at him.<br>
13<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah laughs at him, For He sees that his day is coming.<br>
14<br>
The wrong have drawn the sword And have bent their bow, To cause the poor and needy to fall, To slay those who walk straightly.<br>
15<br>
Their sword does enter into their own heart, And their bows are broken.<br>
16 Tet<br> 
Better is the little of the righteous one, Than the riches of many wrongdoers.<br>
17<br>
For the arms of the wrongdoers are broken, But Yaw-Who-Wah sustains the righteous.<br>
18 Yould<br> 
Yaw-Who-Wah knows the days of the perfect, And their inheritance is forever.<br>
19<br>
They are not ashamed in a time of evil, And in the days of scarcity of food they are satisfied.<br>
20 Cough<br> 
But the wrongdoers shall perish; And the enemies of Yaw-Who-Wah, Like the splendour of the meadows they vanish, Like smoke they vanish away.<br>
21 Laumid<br>
The wrongdoer is borrowing and does not repay, But the righteous one shows favour and gives.<br>
22<br>
For His blessed ones inherit the earth, But those cursed by Him are cut off.<br>
23 Mem<br>
The steps of a man are ordered by Yaw-Who-Wah, And He delights in his way.<br>
24<br>
Though he falls, he is not cast down, For Yaw-Who-Wah is supporting his hand.<br>
25 Noon<br> 
I have been young, and now I am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Or his seed begging bread.<br>
26<br>
All day long he is showing favour and lending; And his seed is for a blessing.<br>
27 Salmick<br>
Turn away from evil, and do good; And dwell forever.<br>
28<br>
For Yaw-Who-Wah loves right-ruling, And does not forsake His lovingly-committed ones; They shall be guarded forever, But the seed of the wrongdoers is cut off.<br>
29 Ian<br>
The righteous shall inherit the earth, And dwell in it forever.<br>
30 Pay<br>
The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, And his tongue talks of right-ruling.<br>
31<br>
The Torah of his EE-Low-Heem is in his heart; His steps do not slide.<br>
32 Saudi<br>
The wrong one is watching for the righteous, And is seeking to slay him.<br>
33<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah does not leave him in his hand, Or let him be declared wrong when he is judged.<br>
34 Koof<br> 
Wait on Yaw-Who-Wah and guard His way, And He shall exalt you to inherit the earth – When the wrongdoers are cut off, you shall see it.<br>
35 Raysh<br>
I have seen the wrongdoer in great power, And spreading himself like a native green tree.<br>
36<br>
he passed away, and see, he was not; And I sought him, but he was not found.<br>
37 Shin<br>
Watch the perfect, and observe the straight; For the latter end of each is peace.<br>
38<br>
But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; The latter end of the wrong shall be cut off.<br>
39 Tov<br>
But the deliverance of the righteous is from Yaw-Who-Wah, Their strength in time of distress.<br>
40<br>
And Yaw-Who-Wah does help them and deliver them; He delivers them from the wrongdoers and saves them, Because they took refuge in Him.<br>

Psalms 37 -- All of Psalms 37, all 40 verses -- Targum<br>
The Targumic Texts are paraphrased-from-memory translations, kind of like a Bible study with sermon notes added in, from a sermon that was many centuries ago.<br>
Targum.info -- English Translation of Targumic Texts:  Targum Psalms -- 2001 English Translation by Edward M. Cook<br>
1. Of David. Have no desire for malefactors, to be like them; and do not be jealous of those who commit oppression, to join with them.<br>
2. Because their end will be like plants, quickly will they wither; and like the green grass they will fall away.<br>
3. Trust in the word of the Lord and do good; dwell in the land and be strong in faith.<br>
(dwell in the land and be busy in faith.)<br>
4. And you will delight in the Lord, and he will give you the requests of your heart.<br>
5. Reveal to the Lord your ways, and trust in his word, and he will act.<br>
6. And your righteousness will come out like light, and your judgement like noonday.<br>
7. Be quiet (and be patient) in the presence of the Lord and wait for him; do not desire the wicked man who prospers his way, the man who follows the counsel of sinners.<br>
8. Wait without anger and forsake wrath; do not long indeed to do evil.<br>
9. For those who do evil will be destroyed; but those who hope in the word of the Lord -- they will inherit the land.<br>
10. And yet a little while, and there is no wicked man; you will look carefully at his place, and he is not.<br>
11. But the humble will inherit the land; and they will delight in the plenitude of peace.<br>
12. The wicked man plots harm against the righteous man, and grinds his teeth against him.<br>
13. The Lord will laugh at him, for he has seen, for the day of his ruin has come.<br>
14. The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bows to kill the humble and lowly, to slaughter the upright of way.<br>
15. Their blade will enter their [own] heart, and their bows will break.<br>
16. Better in the presence of the Lord is the smallness of the righteous man than the multitude of many wicked men.<br>
17. For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the word of the Lord supports the righteous.<br>
18. The days of the blameless are known in the Lord's presence, and their inheritance will last forever.<br>
19. They will not be ashamed in the time of evil, and in the days of famine they are satisfied.<br>
20. For the wicked will perish, and the enemies of the Lord are like the glory of young sheep that at first are fattened but finally slaughtered -- likewise the wicked will perish and be destroyed in the smoke of Gehenna.<br>
21. The wicked borrows and does not repay; but the righteous is compassionate, and gives.<br>
22. For those who are blessed by his word will inherit the land; but those who are cursed by death will be destroyed.<br>
23. In the presence of the Lord the steps of a man are made firm, and he will favour his ways.<br>
24. For when he falls into sickness, he will not die, because the Lord is the helper at his hand.<br>
25. I was a boy, but have grown old; and I have not seen the righteous man abandoned or his sons seeking bread because of want.<br>
26. For all the day he is compassionate and lends; and his seed is for a blessing.<br>
27. Turn from evil, and practice kindness, and abide for eternal life.<br>
(Turn from doing evil, O righteous man, and do good; because of this you will abide forever.)<br>
28. For the Lord loves justice and will not abandon his pious ones; they are protected forever; but the sons of the wicked will be destroyed.<br>
29. The righteous will inherit the land, and will dwell on it forever.<br>
30. The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.<br>
(The Greek or Latin word, nimus, is inserted in the next verse, verse 31. It could have any of the following possible meanings.)<br>
(The son of his God is in his heart; -- the Son of God, Son of Adam, Son of Man, is in his heart)<br>
(The law of his God is in his heart;)<br>
(The name of his God is in his heart;)<br>
(The intention of his God is in his heart;)<br>
31. The law (nimus) of his God is in his heart; his feet do not stumble.<br>
32. The wicked man observes the righteous man and seeks to kill him.<br>
33. The Lord will not abandon him into his hand, and will not find him guilty when he is judged.<br>
(The Lord will not abandon him into his hand, and will not find him guilty when he stands in judgement.)<br>
34. Hope in the word of the Lord, and keep his way, and he will raise you up to inherit the land; you will see the destruction of the wicked.<br>
35. I have seen the wicked man, strong and mighty, like a native and leafy tree.<br>
36. And he ceased from the world, and, behold, he is no more; and I sought him but he was not found.<br>
(Preserve blamelessness, and see honesty;)<br>
(Preserve blamelessness, see and behold the way of honesty;)<br>
37. Preserve blamelessness, and behold honesty; for the end of [such] a son of man is peace.<br>
38. But rebels will be destroyed together; the end of the wicked is destruction.<br>
39. But the redemption of the righteous is from the presence of the Lord, their strength in the time of trouble.<br>
40. And the Lord helped them and saved them, he saved them from sinners; and he will redeem them, for they trusted in his word.<br>

<br>
Fernando Ortega has a delightful song, called, This Good Day, and I wanted to read the lyrics to you.<br>
<br>
Fernando Ortega is a singer-songwriter in contemporary Christian music.<br>
<br>
It is from his heritage of New Mexico where Ortega derives his sound,<br>
embracing country, classical, Celtic, Latin American, world, modern folk and rustic musical elements.<br>
<br>
<br>
As of November 2021, Fernando Ortega<br>
had released over 18 albums, along with an EP and a video DVD,<br>
and he had also contributed to some tracks on six other albums, released by other artists,<br>
including two Calvary Chapel albums.<br>
<br>
His first album was released in 1991, and<br>
his most recent album was titled, The Crucifixion Of Jesus, which came out in 2017.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here we will look at the words to the song, This Good Day.<br>
In this song, when he sings about Woodmans Cove, it is most likely located in the North-East corner of the United States, just north of the city of Alton, New Hampshire,<br>
which is in Lake Winnipesaukee.<br>
Winnipesaukee is pronounced, Win A Bizarre Key.<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, we will read the words to the song, This Good Day.<br> 
It comes from his fifth album, Home, which was released in the year 2000,<br>
by Fernando Ortega...<br>
<br>
<br>
Morning sun and morning glories<br>
Pouring down the hill,<br>
Through my window<br>
I can feel the ocean breeze.<br>
Noisy sparrows fill the oak trees<br>
Swallows can't stay still,<br>
And in the glad commotion<br>
Lord, You speak to me<br>
<br>
<br>
If rain clouds come<br>
Or the cold winds blow,<br>
You're the one who goes before me<br>
And in my heart I know<br>
That This good day<br>
It is a gift from You.<br>
The world is turning in it's place<br>
Because You made it to.<br>
I lift my voice<br>
To sing a song of praise<br>
On this good day.<br>
<br>
<br>
I will walk to Woodman's Cove,<br>
The fishing boats are leaving,<br>
Seagulls follow just above the water.<br>
I will wait until the sunset<br>
Brings them home again,<br>
Rigging lines and anchors in the harbour.<br>
<br>
<br>
If rain clouds come<br>
Or the cold winds blow,<br>
You're the one who goes before me<br>
And in my heart I know<br>
That This good day<br>
It is a gift from You.<br>
The world is turning in it's place<br>
Because You made it to.<br>
I lift my voice<br>
To sing a song of praise<br>
On this good day.<br>
<br>
<br>
If rain clouds come<br>
Or the cold winds blow,<br>
You're the one who goes before me<br>
And in my heart I know<br>
That This good day<br>
It is a gift from You.<br>
The world is turning in it's place<br>
Because You made it to.<br>
This good day<br>
It is a gift from You.<br>
The world is turning in it's place<br>
Because You made it to.<br>
I lift my voice<br>
To sing a song of praise<br>
On this good day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fernando Ortega also has another interesting song, titled, Our Great God.<br>
<br>
Our Great God comes from his seventh album, Storm, back in 2002.<br>
There are two different recordings of this song which were both released in 2002.<br>
<br>
The normal version has just Fernando Ortega singing, and no one else.<br>
<br>
He also made a duet where he and Mac Powell sing the song together.<br>
This duet was part of a project known as, City On A Hill.<br>
City On A Hill is a series of praise and worship music compilations performed by various contemporary Christian musicians.<br>
Under this project, there were made four compilation albums of various artists,<br>
from 2000 to 2003.<br>
The duet version was placed on the second album, City on a Hill -- Sing Alleluia, which came out in 2002.<br>
<br>
The other person singing in the duet, Mac Powell, was the familiar singing voice from the band, Third Day.<br>
Mac Powell, originally from Clanton, Alabama, is an American singer, songwriter, producer, and musician who formed the Christian rock band, Third Day, which was started in 1991, along with guitarist Mark Lee, with both of them being the only continuous members of Third Day until they disbanded in 2018.<br>
Mac Powell won the 2002 Gospel Music Association award for "Male Vocalist of the Year".<br>
<br>
At the end of the duet version, large chimes are heard, giving an instrumental sample of the traditional Doxology song, which we looked at when we did the study, titled, Doxology, in Christian Essays 5.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2002 song, Our Great God, by Fernando Ortega.<br>
The song is available as a solo recording on Fernando Ortega's album, Storm,<br>
and the duet version with Mac Powell is on the Various Artists album, City on a Hill -- Sing Alleluia.<br>

<br>
A jubilee is a special anniversary of an event.<br>
In Leviticus 25, a jubilee is the Jewish celebration of emancipation and restoration held every 50 years.<br>
<br>
Let's enjoy two samples from the Book of Jubilees, Living Hebrew to English Translation, published by Kingdom Preppers -- kingdompreppers.org<br>
The Book of Jubilees is also known as, The Little Genesis, or The Apocalypse of Moses.<br>
The Book of Jubilees is not in the Bible today, but many believe that it used to be another one of the books in the Bible.<br>
<br>
The Book of Jubilees tells us a little bit about Enoch.<br>
Jubilees 4:16-26 -- Living Hebrew to English Translation<br>
16 In the eleventh jubilee Jared took to himself a wife, and her name was Baraka, the daughter of Rasujal, a daughter of his father's brother, in the fourth week of this jubilee, and she gave birth to a son in the fifth week, in the fourth year of the jubilee, and he called his name Enoch.<br>
17 He was the first among men that are born on earth who learned writing and knowledge and wisdom and who wrote down the signs of heaven according to the order of their months in a book, that men might know the seasons of the years according to the order of their separate months.<br>
18 He was the first to write a testimony and he testified to the sons of men among the generations of the earth, and recounted the weeks of the jubilees, and made known to them the days of the years, and set in order the months and recounted the Sabbaths of the years as we made them, known to him.<br>
19 And what was and what will be he saw in a vision of his sleep, as it will happen to the children of men throughout their generations until the day of judgement; he saw and understood everything, and wrote his testimony, and placed the testimony on earth for all the children of men and for their generations.<br>
20 In the twelfth jubilee, in the seventh week of it, he took to himself a wife, and her name was Edna, the daughter of Danel, the daughter of his father's brother, and in the sixth year in this week she gave birth to a son and he called his name Methuselah.<br>
21 He was with the messengers of Elohim these six jubilees of years, and they showed him everything that is on earth and in the heavens, the rule of the sun, and he wrote down everything.<br>
22 And he testified to the Watchers, who had sinned with the daughters of men; for these had begun to unite themselves, so as to be defiled with the daughters of men, and Enoch testified against them all.<br>
23 And he was taken from among the children of men, and we conducted him into the Garden of Eden in majesty and honour, and there he wrote down the condemnation and judgement of the world, and all the wickedness of the children of men.<br>
24 Because of it Elohim brought the waters of the flood on all the land of Eden; for there he was set as a sign and that he should testify against all the children of men, that he should recount all the deeds of the generations until the day of condemnation.<br>
25 He burnt the incense of the sanctuary, even sweet spices acceptable before Yah on the Mount.<br>
26 For Yah has four places on the earth, the Garden of Eden, and the Mount of the East, and this mountain on which you are this day, Mount Sinai, and Mount Zion which will be sanctified in the new creation for a sanctification of the earth; through it will the earth be sanctified from all its guilt and its uncleanness throughout the generations of the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Book of Jubilees, Chapter 6: Verses 36, 37 and 38 -- Living Hebrew to English Translation<br>
36 For there will be those who will assuredly make observations of the moon and how it disturbs the seasons and comes in from year to year ten days too soon.<br>
37 For this reason the years will come upon them when they disturb (misinterpret) the order, and make an abominable day the day of testimony, and an unclean day a feast day, and they will confound all the days, the pure with the unclean, and the unclean day with the pure; for they will go wrong as to the months and sabbaths and feasts and jubilees.<br>
38 For this reason I command and testify to you that you may testify to them; for after your death your children will disturb them, so that they will not make the year three hundred and sixty-four days only, and for this reason they will go wrong as to the new months and seasons and sabbaths and festivals, and they will eat all kinds of blood with all kinds of flesh.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 5:20 (KJV)<br>
Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 5: 19-22 (NLT)<br>
19<br>
They even mock God and say,<br>
"Hurry up and do something!<br>
We want to see what you can do.<br>
Let the Holy One of Israel carry out his plan,<br>
for we want to know what it is."<br>
20<br>
What sorrow for those who say<br>
that evil is good and good is evil,<br>
that dark is light and light is dark,<br>
that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.<br>
21<br>
What sorrow for those who are wise in their own eyes<br>
and think themselves so clever.<br>
22<br>
What sorrow for those who are heroes at drinking wine<br>
and boast about all the alcohol they can hold.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 7: 23-28 -- NLT<br>
23 Then (one of those standing beside the throne) said to me, "This fourth beast is the fourth world power that will rule the earth. It will be different from all the others. It will devour the whole world, trampling and crushing everything in its path.<br>
24 Its ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another king will arise, different from the other ten, who will subdue three of them.<br>
25 He will defy the Most High and oppress the holy people of the Most High. He will try to change their sacred festivals and laws, and they will be placed under his control for a time, times, and half a time.<br>
26 "But then the court will pass judgement, and all his power will be taken away and completely destroyed.<br>
27 Then the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will last forever, and all rulers will serve and obey him."<br>
28 That was the end of the vision. I, Daniel, was terrified by my thoughts and my face was pale with fear, but I kept these things to myself.<br>

Ephesians 4:29 reading into chapter 5, stopping at verse 2 -- KJV<br>
4:29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,<br>
(but that which is good to edify profitably)<br>
but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.<br>
4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.<br>
4:31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:<br>
4:32 And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.<br>
5:1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;<br>
5:2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:29 reading into chapter 5, stopping at verse 2 -- NLT<br>
29 Don't use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.<br>
30 And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live.<br>
(Remember, he has put his seal on you, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.)<br>
Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.<br>
31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behaviour.<br>
32 Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.<br>
1 Imitate God, therefore, in everything you do, because you are his dear children.<br>
2 Live a life filled with love, following the example of Christ. He loved us (and He loved you) and offered himself as a sacrifice for us, a pleasing aroma to God.<br>

Isaiah 38: 12-17 -- KJV<br>
part of King Hezekiah's Poem of Praise<br>
38:12 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life:<br>
(he will cut me off from the thrum)<br>
he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<br>
38:13 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<br>
38:14 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward:<br>
(O LORD, I am oppressed; ease me.)<br>
O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.<br>
38:15 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.<br>
38:16 O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.<br>
<br>
(Behold, on my peace came great bitterness: but thou hast loved me from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.)<br>
38:17 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 38: 12-17 -- NLT<br>
part of King Hezekiah's Poem of Praise<br>
12<br>
My life has been blown away<br>
like a shepherd's tent in a storm.<br>
It has been cut short,<br>
as when a weaver cuts cloth from a loom.<br>
Suddenly, my life was over.<br>
13<br>
I waited patiently all night,<br>
but I was torn apart as though by lions.<br>
Suddenly, my life was over.<br>
14<br>
Delirious, I chattered like a swallow or a crane,<br>
and then I moaned like a mourning dove.<br>
My eyes grew tired of looking to heaven for help.<br>
I am in trouble, Lord. Help me!"<br>
15<br>
But what could I say?<br>
For he himself sent this sickness.<br>
Now I will walk humbly throughout my years<br>
because of this anguish I have felt.<br>
16<br>
Lord, your discipline is good,<br>
for it leads to life and health.<br>
You restore my health<br>
and allow me to live!<br>
17<br>
Yes, this anguish was good for me,<br>
for you have rescued me from death<br>
and forgiven all my sins.<br>
<br>

Hebrews 12: 14 & 15 -- KJV<br>
12:14	Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:<br>
(Looking diligently lest any man fall from the grace of God)<br>
12:15	Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 14 & 15 -- NLT<br>
14 Work at living in peace with everyone, and work at living a holy life, for those who are not holy will not see the Lord.<br>
15 Look after each other so that none of you fails to receive the grace of God. Watch out that no poisonous root of bitterness grows up to trouble you, corrupting many.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 14 & 15 -- TS2009<br>
14 Pursue peace with all, and pursue apartness without which no one shall see the Master.<br>
15 See to it that no one falls short of the favour of Elohim, that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, by which many become defiled,<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 3:14 (KJV)<br>
So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 3: 14-20 (NLT)<br>
14 The Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I went in bitterness and turmoil, but the Lord's hold on me was strong.<br>
15 Then I came to the colony of Judean exiles in Tel-abib, beside the Kebar River. I was overwhelmed and sat among them for seven days.<br>
16 After seven days the Lord gave me a message. He said,<br>
17 "Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for Israel. Whenever you receive a message from me, warn people immediately.<br>
18 If I warn the wicked, saying, 'You are under the penalty of death,' but you fail to deliver the warning, they will die in their sins. And I will hold you responsible for their deaths.<br>
19 If you warn them and they refuse to repent and keep on sinning, they will die in their sins. But you will have saved yourself because you obeyed me.<br>
20 "If righteous people turn away from their righteous behaviour and ignore the obstacles I put in their way, they will die. And if you do not warn them, they will die in their sins. None of their righteous acts will be remembered, and I will hold you responsible for their deaths.<br>
21 But if you warn righteous people not to sin and they listen to you and do not sin, they will live, and you will have saved yourself, too."<br>

Commentary:<br>
The dictionaries today will commonly tell us that The Gentiles are all of those who are not Jewish.<br>
Actually, in the Bible, The Gentiles simply refer to all of the people of all families, all races, all nations, and all tribes.<br>
So, in the Bible, the Gentiles are all of the people, of all of the nations around the world.<br>
It's not about the Jews, and the non-Jews, it's about The Gentiles being all nations, which would include everyone, including the Jewish people.<br>
Keep that in mind as you encounter the mentioning of the Gentiles in the following Bible study.<br>
<br>
<br>
We are now going to take a closer look at a spot that we looked at back in<br>
Christian Essays 12, when we did the Bible study titled, The Hall of Faith.<br>
Some of this was also mentioned in that study, and in other areas in Christian Essays 12,<br>
which is also known as, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 12.<br>
<br>
Romans 1:16-19 KJV<br>
16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek (the Gentile).<br>
17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.<br>
18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;<br>
19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 1:16-19 NLT<br>
16 For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes -- the Jew first and also the Gentile.<br>
(It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes -- the Jew first and also the Greek.)<br>
<br>
17 This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, "It is through faith that a righteous person has life."<br>
("The righteous will live by faith." -- Quoting from Habakkuk 2:4.)<br>
<br>
18 But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who suppress the truth by their wickedness.<br>
(But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who, by their wickedness, prevent the truth from being known.)<br>
<br>
19 They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 3: 9-13 KJV<br>
3:9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.<br>
3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.<br>
3:11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.<br>
3:12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.<br>
3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law....<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 3: 9-13 NLT<br>
9 So all who put their faith in Christ share the same blessing Abraham received because of his faith.<br>
<br>
10 But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, "Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God's Book of the Law."<br>
(Quoting from Deuteronomy 27:26.)<br>
<br>
11 So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law. For the Scriptures say, "It is through faith that a righteous person has life."<br>
(Quoting from Habakkuk 2:4.)<br>
<br>
12 This way of faith is very different from the way of law, which says, "It is through obeying the law that a person has life."<br>
(Quoting from Leviticus 18:5.)<br>
<br>
13 But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 2:2-4 KJV<br>
2 And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.<br>
3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.<br>
4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 2:2-4 NLT<br>
2<br>
Then the Lord said to me,<br>
"Write my answer plainly on tablets,<br>
so that a runner can carry the correct message to others.<br>
3<br>
This vision is for a future time.<br>
It describes the end, and it will be fulfilled.<br>
If it seems slow in coming, wait patiently,<br>
for it will surely take place.<br>
It will not be delayed.<br>
4<br>
"Look at the proud!<br>
They trust in themselves, and their lives are crooked.<br>
But the righteous will live by their faithfulness to God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 2: 3 & 4 -- NLT Greek version:<br>
If the vision is delayed, wait patiently,<br>
for it will surely come and not delay.<br>
4<br>
I will take no pleasure in anyone who turns away.<br>
But the righteous person will live by my faith.<br>
<br>
The Greek version of Habakkuk 2:4 is quoted in<br>
Romans 1:17; Galatians 3:11; and in Hebrews 10:37-38.<br>
We just saw those quotes in Romans 1:17 and at Galatians 3:11.<br>
Let's look at the third quote in Hebrews 10.<br>
We are targeting verses 37 and 38, but we will also read the verses around them.<br>
We will start by reading the last five verses at the end of chapter 10...<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10: Starting at Verse 35, and we keep reading into Chapter 11, stopping at verse 2.<br>
KJV:<br>
10:35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.<br>
10:36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.<br>
10:37 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.<br>
10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.<br>
10:39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.<br>
(Now faith is the ground of things hoped for,)<br>
(Now faith is the confidence of things hoped for,)<br>
11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.<br>
11:2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10: Starting at Verse 32, and we keep reading into Chapter 11, stopping at verse 2.<br>
NLT:<br>
...Remember how you remained faithful even though it meant terrible suffering.<br>
33 Sometimes you were exposed to public ridicule and were beaten, and sometimes you helped others who were suffering the same things.<br>
34 You suffered along with those who were thrown into jail, and when all you owned was taken from you, you accepted it with joy. You knew there were better things waiting for you that will last forever.<br>
35 So do not throw away this confident trust in the Lord. Remember the great reward it brings you!<br>
36 Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God's will. Then you will receive all that he has promised.<br>
37<br>
"For in just a little while, the Coming One will come and not delay.<br>
38<br>
And my righteous ones will live by faith.<br>
(My righteous ones will live by their faithfulness. My righteous one will live by faith.)<br>
But I will take no pleasure in anyone who turns away." (quoting from the book of Habakkuk 2:3-4.)<br>
<br>
39 But we are not like those who turn away from God to their own destruction. We are the faithful ones, whose souls will be saved.<br>
1 Faith shows the reality of what we hope for; it is the evidence of things we cannot see.<br>
2 Through their faith, the people in days of old earned a good reputation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41, starting at verse 26, and we keep reading into chapter 42, stopping at verse 8.<br>
KJV:<br>
41:26 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that heareth your words.<br>
41:27 The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.<br>
41:28 For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.<br>
(that, when I asked of them, could return a word.)<br>
41:29 Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.<br>
42:1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgement to the Gentiles.<br>
42:2 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.<br>
42:3 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgement unto truth.<br>
(A bruised reed shall he not break, and the dimly burning flax shall he not quench it: he shall bring forth judgement unto truth.)<br>
(He shall not fail nor be broken, till he have set judgement in the earth:)<br>
42:4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgement in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.<br>
42:5 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:<br>
42:6 I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;<br>
42:7 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.<br>
42:8 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41, starting at verse 26, and we keep reading into chapter 42, stopping at verse 8.<br>
NLT:<br>
26<br>
"Who told you from the beginning<br>
that this would happen?<br>
Who predicted this,<br>
making you admit that he was right?<br>
No one said a word!<br>
27<br>
I was the first to tell Zion,<br>
'Look! Help is on the way!'<br>
(Look! They are coming home!)<br>
I will send Jerusalem a messenger with good news.<br>
28<br>
Not one of your idols told you this.<br>
Not one gave any answer when I asked.<br>
29<br>
See, they are all foolish, worthless things.<br>
All your idols are as empty as the wind.<br>
1<br>
"Look at my servant, whom I strengthen.<br>
He is my chosen one, who pleases me.<br>
I have put my Spirit upon him.<br>
He will bring justice to the nations.<br>
2<br>
He will not shout<br>
or raise his voice in public.<br>
3<br>
He will not crush the weakest reed<br>
or put out a flickering candle.<br>
He will bring justice to all who have been wronged.<br>
4<br>
He will not falter or lose heart<br>
until justice prevails throughout the earth.<br>
Even distant lands beyond the sea will wait for his instruction."<br>
(And his name will be the hope of all the world.)<br>
5<br>
God, the Lord, created the heavens and stretched them out.<br>
He created the earth and everything in it.<br>
He gives breath to everyone,<br>
life to everyone who walks the earth.<br>
And it is he who says,<br>
6<br>
"I, the Lord, have called you to demonstrate my righteousness.<br>
I will take you by the hand and guard you,<br>
and I will give you to my people, Israel,<br>
as a symbol of my covenant with them.<br>
And you will be a light to guide the nations.<br>
7<br>
You will open the eyes of the blind.<br>
You will free the captives from prison,<br>
releasing those who sit in dark dungeons.<br>
8<br>
"I am the Lord; that is my name!<br>
I will not give my glory to anyone else,<br>
nor share my praise with carved idols.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In The Scriptures 2009 translation, Hebrew names are spelled a certain way to assist in trying to more accurately pronounce them in the ancient Hebrew language.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41, starting at verse 26, and we keep reading into chapter 42, stopping at verse 9.<br>
The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009):<br>
26 "Who has declared from the beginning, and we know? and former times, and we say, 'He is righteous'? No, no one is declaring; no, no one is proclaiming; no, no one is hearing your words.<br>
27 "He who is First said to Tsiyon, 'See, see them!' And to Yerushalayim I give one who brings good news.<br>
28 "And I see that there is no man, and of these, there is no counsellor, who, when I ask of them, answers a word.<br>
29 "See, all of them are useless, their works are naught, their moulded images are wind and confusion.<br>
1 "See, My Servant whom I uphold, My Chosen One My being has delighted in! I have put My Spirit upon Him; He brings forth right-ruling to the nations.<br>
2 "He does not cry out, nor lifts up His voice, nor causes His voice to be heard in the street.<br>
3 "A crushed reed He does not break, and smoking flax He does not quench. He brings forth right-ruling in accordance with truth.<br>
4 "He does not become weak or crushed, until He has established right-ruling in the earth. And the coastlands wait for His Torah."<br>
5 Thus said the God, EE-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread forth the earth and that which comes from it, who gives breath to the people on it, and spirit to those who walk on it:<br>
6 "I, Yaw-Who-Wah, have called You in righteousness,<br>
(and I take hold of Your hand and guard You,)<br>
and I strengthen Your hand and guard You, and give You for a covenant to a people, for a light to the nations,<br>
7 to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from the prison, those who sit in darkness from the prison house.<br>
8 "I am Yaw-Who-Wah, that is My Name, and My esteem I do not give to another, nor My praise to idols.<br>
9 "See, the former predictions have come, and new ones I am declaring; before they spring forth I let you hear them."<br>

Commentary:<br>
Psalms are poems sung to the accompaniment of a stringed instrument.<br>
<br>
The book of Psalms spans across a timeline of at least five centuries.<br>
This means that, it took more than 500 years to eventually write all of the Psalms that we have today in the Bible.<br>
<br>
How many Psalms were there originally?  No one is really sure.<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls has 160 Psalms.<br>
The Eth Cepher Bible has 155 Psalms.<br>
The English Bibles that most of us have today have just 150 Psalms.<br>
The New Testament quotes from the book of Psalms more than 75 times.<br>
The epistle to the Romans, what we simply refer to today as the book of Romans, written by Paul, quotes or references the book of Psalms more than fourteen times.<br>
<br>
In some translations published in previous centuries, the numbering system was not always kept the same.<br>
Some Greek Psalm translations had some slight numbering differences, like mixing up some of Psalms 22 and 23.<br>
Or merging Psalms 9 and 10 together, making their numbering system off by one after that.<br>
<br>
The authors that contributed to creating these various Psalms would include Adam, Ethan the Ezrahite, Melchizedek, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Heman the Ezrahite, Jeduthun, Asaph, and the sons of Korah.<br>
Several of them do not come with any credit. There are some of these that, we are not really sure who wrote some of the Psalms.<br>
We can argue and discuss and take a guess about some of the authors, but we are not really certain.<br>
Depending on your research, and which sources you turn to, many experts are confident that, at least 73 of the Psalms, or perhaps as many as 80 of the Psalms were written by David, with many of them clearly identified as being written by him.<br>
<br>
Fourteen of the psalms that were written by David, we know are based on, or commemorate some event in his life.<br>
<br>
Some of the psalms include some information that tell us what David was going through when he wrote that particular psalm.<br>
<br>
For example, Psalms 59 is based on what happened in 1 Samuel 19, when Saul Tries to Kill David and Michal Saves David's Life.<br>
<br>
Another example is, Psalms 56 which was written when David tried to enter into Gath (in Philistine territory). He pretended to be crazy, letting spit drool down his beard, so that he might be allowed into the city. David did this because he was afraid and thought that he would be safe amongst the Philistines.<br>
That story found is 1 Samuel 21:10-15 and that is what Psalms 56 is all about.<br>
<br>
There are places on the internet where people have done the research to figure out which psalm points to which event in David's life.<br>
One example to find out more about this would be the following website.<br>
<br>
A recommended webpage to read, to find out more about this, is titled, The Psalms Written By David.<br>
And it is published on the Living Word Bible Church Website, in the United Kingdom.<br>
The Living Word Bible Church is an independent Christian Church based in Liverpool, United Kingdom.<br>
As of November 2021, the webpage, The Psalms Written By David, was found here:<br>
<a href="https://predikuesi.wordpress.com/the-psalms-written-by-david/">https://predikuesi.wordpress.com/the-psalms-written-by-david/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.lwbc.co.uk/the-psalms-written-by-david/">http://www.lwbc.co.uk/the-psalms-written-by-david/</a><br>
<br>
In several of the psalms that David wrote, he talks about going through fearful, difficult and stressful situations where enemies desire to kill him.<br>
But, then, he steers each psalm back to focusing and placing his hope on the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, and is confident that the Lord will strengthen him, save him and deliver him.<br>
<br>
There is one psalm that David wrote that is mainly just totally positive and encouraging with praise, and does not have any of the fearful, bad parts.<br>
If you study this particular psalm carefully, you will notice that it has several samples and bits of material that sound quite familiar, as they are also found in many other psalms that David wrote.<br>
It's kind of like a medley, mega-mix, smash-up version of the best, happy parts of several of David's psalms all mixed together.<br>
Where do you find this super Psalm mega-mix medley? This psalm by David is not in the book of Psalms.<br>
It's in the book of 1 Chronicles, in chapter 16.<br>
Here is what happened just before this chapter.<br>
In chapter 13, David Attempts to Move the Ark, but does not transport it the correct way as commanded in the Bible, by using a certain clan of people that are supposed to use carrying poles and carry the ark.<br>
He tried to use a cart instead, and a man died as a result.<br>
So, by the time we get to chapter 16, he found out how to do it the right way.<br>
They finally Move the Ark to Jerusalem successfully, and that's where David's Song of Praise begins.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 16: 7-36 -- KJV<br>
16:7 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.<br>
16:8 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.<br>
16:9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.<br>
16:10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.<br>
16:11 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.<br>
16:12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgements of his mouth;<br>
16:13 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.<br>
16:14 He is the LORD our God; his judgements are in all the earth.<br>
16:15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;<br>
16:16 Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;<br>
<br>
16:17 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,<br>
<br>
16:18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;<br>
(the cord of your inheritance;)<br>
(When ye were but men of number, even a few men of number, and strangers in it.)<br>
16:19 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.<br>
<br>
16:20 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;<br>
16:21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,<br>
16:22 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.<br>
16:23 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.<br>
16:24 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.<br>
16:25 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.<br>
16:26 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.<br>
16:27 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.<br>
16:28 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.<br>
16:29 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.<br>
16:30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.<br>
16:31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.<br>
16:32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.<br>
16:33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.<br>
16:34 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.<br>
16:35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.<br>
16:36 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 16: 7-36 -- NLT<br>
7<br>
On that day David gave to Asaph and his fellow Levites this song of thanksgiving to the Lord:<br>
8<br>
Give thanks to the Lord and proclaim his greatness.<br>
Let the whole world know what he has done.<br>
9<br>
Sing to him; yes, sing his praises.<br>
Tell everyone about his wonderful deeds.<br>
10<br>
Exult in his holy name;<br>
rejoice, you who worship the Lord.<br>
11<br>
Search for the Lord and for his strength;<br>
continually seek him.<br>
12<br>
Remember the wonders he has performed,<br>
his miracles, and the rulings he has given,<br>
13<br>
you children of his servant Israel,<br>
you descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones.<br>
14<br>
He is the Lord our God.<br>
His justice is seen throughout the land.<br>
15<br>
Remember his covenant forever -- <br>
the commitment he made to a thousand generations.<br>
16<br>
This is the covenant he made with Abraham<br>
and the oath he swore to Isaac.<br>
17<br>
He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,<br>
and to the people of Israel as a never-ending covenant:<br>
18<br>
"I will give you the land of Canaan<br>
as your special possession."<br>
19<br>
He said this when you were few in number,<br>
a tiny group of strangers in Canaan.<br>
20<br>
They wandered from nation to nation,<br>
from one kingdom to another.<br>
21<br>
Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.<br>
He warned kings on their behalf:<br>
22<br>
"Do not touch my chosen people,<br>
and do not hurt my prophets."<br>
23<br>
Let the whole earth sing to the Lord!<br>
Each day proclaim the good news that he saves.<br>
24<br>
Publish his glorious deeds among the nations.<br>
Tell everyone about the amazing things he does.<br>
25<br>
Great is the Lord! He is most worthy of praise!<br>
He is to be feared above all gods.<br>
26<br>
The gods of other nations are mere idols,<br>
but the Lord made the heavens!<br>
27<br>
Honour and majesty surround him;<br>
strength and joy fill his dwelling.<br>
28<br>
O nations of the world, recognise the Lord,<br>
recognise that the Lord is glorious and strong.<br>
29<br>
Give to the Lord the glory he deserves!<br>
Bring your offering and come into his presence.<br>
Worship the Lord in all his holy splendour.<br>
30<br>
Let all the earth tremble before him.<br>
The world stands firm and cannot be shaken.<br>
31<br>
Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice!<br>
Tell all the nations, "The Lord reigns!"<br>
32<br>
Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise!<br>
Let the fields and their crops burst out with joy!<br>
33<br>
Let the trees of the forest sing for joy before the Lord,<br>
for he is coming to judge the earth.<br>
34<br>
Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good!<br>
His faithful love endures forever.<br>
35<br>
Cry out, "Save us, O God of our salvation!<br>
Gather and rescue us from among the nations,<br>
so we can thank your holy name<br>
and rejoice and praise you."<br>
36<br>
Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,<br>
who lives from everlasting to everlasting!<br>
And all the people shouted "Amen!" and praised the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 16: 7-36 -- TS2009<br>
7 And on that day David first gave thanks to Yaw-Who-Wah by the hand of Asaph and his brothers:<br>
8 Give thanks to Yaw-Who-Wah, call upon His Name, Make known His deeds among the peoples!<br>
9 Sing to Him, sing praise to Him, Speak of all His wonders!<br>
10 Boast in His set-apart Name, Let the hearts of those seeking Yaw-Who-Wah rejoice!<br>
11 Seek Yaw-Who-Wah and His strength, Seek His face continually!<br>
12 Remember His wonders which He has done, His signs and the right-rulings of His mouth,<br>
13 O seed of Israel (Yis-Rye-ELL), His servant; O children of Jacob (Yeah-Koab), His chosen ones!<br>
14 He is Yaw-Who-Wah our God (our EE-Low-Heem), His right-rulings are in all the earth.<br>
15 Remember His covenant forever, The Word He commanded for a thousand generations,<br>
16 Which He made with Abraham (Ah-Bra-Hawm), And His oath to Isaac (EE-Sock),<br>
17 And He established it to Jacob (Yeah-Koab) for a law, To Israel (Yis-Rye-ELL) as an everlasting covenant,<br>
18 Saying, "To you I give the land of Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,"<br>
19 When you were but few in number, Few indeed, and sojourners in it.<br>
20 And they went up and down, From one nation to another, And from one reign to another people.<br>
21 He allowed no one to oppress them, And He reproved sovereigns for their sakes, saying:<br>
22 "Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no evil."<br>
23 Sing to Yaw-Who-Wah, all the earth; Proclaim His deliverance from day to day.<br>
24 Declare His esteem among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.<br>
25 For great is Yaw-Who-Wah and greatly to be praised; And He is to be feared above all mighty ones.<br>
26 For all the mighty ones of the peoples are matters of naught, But Yaw-Who-Wah made the heavens.<br>
27 Excellency and splendour are before Him, Strength and gladness are in His place.<br>
28 Ascribe to Yaw-Who-Wah, O clans of the peoples, Ascribe to Yaw-Who-Wah esteem and strength.<br>
29 Ascribe to Yaw-Who-Wah the esteem of His Name; Bring an offering, and come before Him; Bow yourself to Yaw-Who-Wah In the splendour of set-apartness!<br>
30 Tremble before Him, all the earth. The world also is firmly established, immovable.<br>
31 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; And let them say among the nations, "Yaw-Who-Wah shall reign."<br>
32 Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; Let the field rejoice, and all that is in it.<br>
33 Let the trees of the forest then sing before Yaw-Who-Wah, For He shall come to judge the earth.<br>
34 Give thanks to Yaw-Who-Wah, for He is good, For His loving-commitment is everlasting!<br>
35 And say, "Save us, O EE-Low-Heem of our deliverance; And gather us together, And deliver us from the nations, To give thanks to Your set-apart Name, And boast in Your praise."<br>
36 Blessed be Yaw-Who-Wah EE-Low-Heem of Yis-Rye-ELL From everlasting to everlasting! And all the people said, "Ah-Main!" and praised Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>

<br>
During a random moment about half-way into Christian Essays 5,<br>
which is also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 5,<br>
we did a Bible study by reading all of Psalms 34 in the KJV and NLT.<br>
Since some of the verses in our previous Bible study came from Psalms 34,<br>
let's look at all of Psalms 34 again one more time right now,<br>
but this time we will look at it in The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) translation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34 and Psalms 56 were both written for remembering<br>
when David tried to enter in and live in Gath (in Philistine territory).<br>
He pretended to be mad so that he might be allowed into the city.<br>
David did this because he was afraid and thought that he would be safe amongst the Philistines.<br>
Psalms 34 and Psalms 56 are both based on this story, found in 1 Samuel 21:10-15.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 21:10-15 reading on into chapter 22, verse 2 -- NLT<br>
10 So David escaped from Saul and went to King Achish of Gath.<br>
11 But the officers of Achish were unhappy about his being there.<br>
"Isn't this David, the king of the land?" they asked. "Isn't he the one the people honour with dances, singing,<br>
'Saul has killed his thousands,<br>
and David his ten thousands'?"<br>
12 David heard these comments and was very afraid of what King Achish of Gath might do to him.<br>
13 So he pretended to be insane, scratching on doors and drooling down his beard.<br>
14 Finally, King Achish said to his men, "Must you bring me a madman?<br>
15 We already have enough of them around here! Why should I let someone like this be my guest?"<br>
1 So David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. Soon his brothers and all his other relatives joined him there.<br>
2 Then others began coming -- men who were in trouble or in debt or who were just discontented -- until David was the captain of about 400 men.<br>

Psalms 34 is a Hebrew acrostic poem; just about each verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>

Psalms 34, all 22 verses of Psalms 34 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
(PSALMS) 34<br>
1 All-if<br>
I bless Yaw-Who-Wah at all times; His praise is continually in my mouth.<br>
2 Bet<br>
My being makes its boast in Yaw-Who-Wah; Let the humble hear and be glad.<br>
3 Gimmel<br>
Oh, make Yaw-Who-Wah great with me, And let us exalt His Name together.<br>
4 Doll-it<br>
I sought Yaw-Who-Wah, and He answered me, And delivered me from all my fears.<br>
5 Hey<br>
They looked to Him and were lightened,<br>
Wah-oo (today, that same Hebrew letter is now pronounced, Vahv)<br>
(They looked to Him and were radiant with joy,)<br>
(They shall look unto him, and run to him)<br>
And their faces were not ashamed.<br>
6 Zian<br>
This poor one cried out and Yaw-Who-Wah heard him, And saved him out of all his distresses.<br>
7<br>
The messenger of Yaw-Who-Wah encamps all around those who fear Him, And rescues them.<br>
8 Tet<br>
Oh, taste and see that Yaw-Who-Wah is good; Blessed is the man that takes refuge in Him!<br>
9 Yould<br>
Fear Yaw-Who-Wah, you His set-apart ones, For there is no lack to them who fear Him!<br>

Keep your tongue from evil, And your lips from speaking deceit.<br>

Turn away from evil and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it.<br>

16 Ian<br>
The face of Yaw-Who-Wah is against evil-doers, To cut off their remembrance from the earth.<br>
17 Saudi<br>

Many are the evils of the righteous, But Yaw-Who-Wah delivers him out of them all.<br>
20 Shin<br>
He is guarding all his bones; Not one of them is broken.<br>
21 Tov<br>
Evil does slay the wrong, And those who hate the righteous are guilty.<br>
22<br>

Back in Christian Essays 16,<br>
We did a Bible study, titled, Way Truth Life.<br>
In that study we mentioned,<br>
Jesus is the way, the truth and the life. (John 14:6)<br>
Jesus is Torah (the word, the commandments, the Law, the Bible) that became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14)<br>
and so, Torah is the way, the truth and the life.<br>
we saw the way, the truth and the life in the Old Testament.<br>
I was curious what the TS2009 translation did with those Old Testament verses.<br>
<br>
Let's find out.<br>
<br>
The Torah is The Way...<br>
Psalms 119:1 KJV<br>
(Blessed are the perfect in the way)<br>
(Blessed are the sincere in the way)<br>
Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:1 TS2009<br>
Blessed are the perfect in the way, Who walk in the Torah of Yaw-Who-Wah!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Torah is The Truth...<br>
Psalms 119: 142 & 143 KJV<br>
142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.<br>
(Trouble and anguish have found me: yet thy commandments are my delights.)<br>
143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119: 142 & 143 TS2009<br>
142 Your righteousness is righteousness forever, And Your Torah is truth.<br>
143 Distress and anguish have found me; Your commands are my delight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Torah is The Life, a fountain of Life<br>
Proverbs 13: 13 & 14 KJV<br>
13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.<br>
(he that feareth the commandment shall be in peace.)<br>
14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 13: 13 & 14 TS2009<br>
13 He who despises the Word is destroyed, But he who fears the command is rewarded.<br>
14 The Torah of the wise is a fountain of life, Turning one away from the snares of death.<br>

Psalms 88:9 (NLT)<br>
My eyes are blinded by my tears. Each day I beg for your help, O Lord; I lift my hands to you for mercy.<br>
<br>
Psalms 28:2 (NLT)<br>
Listen to my prayer for mercy as I cry out to you for help, as I lift my hands toward your holy sanctuary.<br>
<br>
1 Chronicles 29:11 (NLT)<br>
Yours, O Lord, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty. Everything in the heavens and on earth is yours, O Lord, and this is your kingdom. We adore you as the one who is over all things.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 61: 1-3 (KJV)<br>
61:1 The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;<br>
61:2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;<br>
61:3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 61: 1-3 NLT<br>
1<br>
The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon me,<br>
for the Lord has anointed me<br>
to bring good news to the poor.<br>
He has sent me to comfort the broken-hearted<br>
and to proclaim that captives will be released<br>
and prisoners will be freed.<br>
(and the blind will see.)<br>
2<br>
He has sent me to tell those who mourn<br>
(to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,)<br>
that the time of the Lord's favour has come,<br>
and with it, the day of God’s anger against their enemies.<br>
3<br>
(To all who mourn in Zion,)<br>
To all who mourn in Israel,<br>
he will give a crown of beauty for ashes,<br>
a joyous blessing instead of mourning,<br>
festive praise instead of despair.<br>
In their righteousness, they will be like great oaks<br>
that the Lord has planted for his own glory.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 15: 30 & 31 (KJV)<br>
15:30 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:<br>
15:31 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.<br>
<br>
Matthew 15: 29-31 (NLT)<br>
29 Jesus returned to the Sea of Galilee and climbed a hill and sat down.<br>
30 A vast crowd brought to him people who were lame, blind, crippled, those who couldn't speak, and many others. They laid them before Jesus, and he healed them all.<br>
31 The crowd was amazed! Those who hadn't been able to speak were talking, the crippled were made well, the lame were walking, and the blind could see again! And they praised the God of Israel.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 1:30 (NLT)<br>

<br>
Deuteronomy 1: 32 & 33 (NLT)<br>

In areas found in Christian Essays 18 and 19, which would be<br>
The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapters 18 and 19,<br>
We had previously talked about 2 Chronicles 20<br>
and the story about King Jehoshaphat.<br>
We also mentioned that Phil Wickham had a popular song based on that story.<br>
Here is a sample again from that story...<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 20:15 (KJV)<br>
and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not your's, but God's.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 20:17 (NLT)<br>
But you will not even need to fight. Take your positions; then stand still and watch the Lord's victory. He is with you, O people of Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid or discouraged. Go out against them tomorrow, for the Lord is with you!"<br>
<br>
<br>
So, let's take a look at the words to the song, Battle Belongs.<br>
<br>
This song that we will read the lyrics to next, is titled, Battle Belongs,<br>
and it is a song by American contemporary Christian musician Phil Wickham.<br>
The song was released on 4 September 2020,<br>
and was later released on Phil Wickham's eighth studio album, Hymn of Heaven (2021).<br>
That album was eventually released on 25 June 2021, over 9 months after the single was released.<br>
The second single, House of the Lord, released on 2 April 2021, was what we looked at<br>
when we were in Christian Essays 18.<br>
<br>
The song, Battle Belongs, by Phil Wickham<br>
was the number 4 most popular Christian Song of 2021<br>
according to Billboard Magazine's 2021 Year-End Chart for the<br>
Top 100 most popular Hot Christian Songs of the year 2021.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2020 song, Battle Belongs, by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When All I See Is The Battle, You See My Victory<br>
When All I See Is The Mountain, You See A Mountain Moved<br>
And As I Walk Through The Shadow, Your Love Surrounds Me<br>
There's Nothing To Fear Now For I Am Safe With You<br>
<br>
So When I Fight, I'll Fight On My Knees<br>
With My Hands Lifted High<br>
Oh God, The Battle Belongs To You<br>
And Every Fear I Lay At Your Feet<br>
I'll Sing Through The Night<br>
Oh God, The Battle Belongs To You<br>
<br>
And If You Are For Me, Who Can Be Against Me? Yeah<br>
For Jesus There's Nothing Impossible For You<br>
When All I See Are The Ashes,<br>
You See The Beauty<br>
Thank You, God<br>
When All I See Is A Cross, God, You See The Empty Tomb<br>
<br>
So When I Fight, I'll Fight On My Knees<br>
With My Hands Lifted High<br>
Oh God, The Battle Belongs To You<br>
And Every Fear I Lay At Your Feet<br>
I'll Sing Through The Night<br>
Oh God, The Battle Belongs To You<br>
<br>
<br>
Almighty Fortress, You Go Before Us<br>
Nothing Can Stand Against The Power Of Our God<br>
You Shine In The Shadow, You Win Every Battle<br>

Toby McKeehan was born with the name of, Kevin Michael McKeehan,<br>
but he's better known by his stage name, TobyMac.<br>
TobyMac is an American Christian hip hop rapper and singer.<br>
He has charted 20 solo singles on Billboard's Christian Songs list, and is a Seven-Time Grammy award winner.<br>
He was first known for being a member of the Christian rap and<br>
rock trio DC Talk, staying with them from 1987 until they went on hiatus in 2000.<br>
He has since continued a successful solo career<br>
with the release of seven studio albums.<br>
<br>
He was 56 years old at the time when he uploaded onto YouTube, the black and white music video,<br>
TobyMac - Promised Land<br>
which was uploaded on 19 September 2021.<br>
<br>
A few days later he uploaded<br>
TobyMac - Promised Land (Song Story)<br>
on 25 September 2021.<br>
<br>
And he recently turned 57 years old when he uploaded new footage of another separate video performance for a second music video,<br>
TobyMac - Promised Land (Lyric Video)<br>
uploaded on 26 November 2021.<br>
<br>
As of December 2021, the song was only available<br>
for listening or downloading as a single.<br>
The single had not yet been placed onto any album.<br>
Chances are, it will likely be placed on TobyMac's next album<br>
when that next album gets released sometime in the year 2022.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Song Story video uploaded to YouTube shows TobyMac telling us a little bit about the story behind the song.<br>
<br>
Written by TobyMac and Adam Agee, some of the things that TobyMac tells us in the video, is that he says, “I think if we're honest, each of us have wondered, where is the promised land?," he remarks.<br>
"...Where's the blessing for me and my family that I thought would come my way on this earth when I chose to follow the King of Kings?"<br>
<br>
He also tells us that, in support of the single, the multi-platinum artist simultaneously exclusively premiered the music video on Facebook in honour of his Granddad,<br>
a miner in West Virginia, where TobyMac's own father grew up in a mining camp.<br>
"It was a hard life," he says. "A life where I imagine they must have really wondered where in the world is my promised land?"<br>
<br>
Ultimately, he says of the song, "The lyrics land where I want my life to land: that the promised land is no land at all, but a relationship with the King that loves us deeply.<br>
It turns from, where's my promised land, to, you're my promised land. Maybe the promised land we're looking for is no place at all, but a person named Jesus."<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2021 song, Promised Land, by TobyMac.<br>
<br>
<br>
Head down as I punch this clock<br>
The hours roll, they never stop<br>
And I can't ever seem to get ahead<br>
<br>
Always tryin' to do what's right<br>
Straight and narrow's gettin' tight<br>
Don't know how much longer I can stand<br>
<br>
<br>
And I'm wonderin'<br>
Yeah, I'm wonderin'<br>
Where's my promised land?<br>
<br>
<br>
Out here on this desert road<br>
It's hot as fire but I've grown cold<br>
Circlin' like a plane that never lands<br>
<br>
And even though the questions change<br>
The answers always stay the same<br>
Maybe someday I will understand<br>
<br>
So I'm wonderin'<br>
Got me wonderin'<br>
Where's my promised land?<br>
Yeah, I'm wonderin'<br>
Still I'm wonderin'<br>
Where's my promised land?<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, I've run this Earth for many years<br>
If there's one thing I know<br>
There's nowhere on this side o' Heaven<br>
Where streets are made o' gold<br>
I've long laid down my grand illusions<br>
Looking toward the day that I'll be<br>
Home<br>
<br>
<br>
I won't give up on this race<br>
Broken but I still have faith<br>
That this old life is all part of a plan<br>
<br>
And I can feel it in my soul<br>
One day, I'll stand before the throne<br>
With nothing left but hope in these two hands<br>
<br>
<br>
Through all these seasons<br>
I'm still believing<br>
You're my promised land<br>
<br>
In all my grieving<br>
I'm still believing<br>
You're my promised land<br>
<br>
<br>
You're my promised<br>
Land<br>
Ooh, ooh-ooh,<br>
Ooh, ooh-ooh,<br>
<br>
My promised<br>
Land<br>
Ooh ooh<br>
Ooh ooh<br>
Ah, ah<br>
Ooh, ooh-ooh, <br>
Oh, oh<br>
Ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
You're my promised land<br>
