Psalms 19:14<br>
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer. <br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a look at the words to a song by<br>
Tim Hughes.<br>
The song is titled,<br>
May The Words Of My Mouth.<br>
Tim Hughes is a British worship leader, singer, songwriter, and Anglican priest.<br>
<br>
The song, May The Words Of My Mouth, is available on the Tim Hughes Album:  Here I Am to Worship.<br>
That album was released on 24 December 2001.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to, May The Words Of My Mouth, from Tim Hughes...<br>
<br>
<br>
May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart<br>
Bless Your name, bless Your name, Jesus<br>
And the deeds of the day and the truth in my ways<br>
Speak of You, speak of You, Jesus<br>
<br>
For this is what I'm glad to do<br>
It's time to live a life of love that pleases You<br>
And I will give my all to You<br>
Surrender everything I have and follow You<br>
I'll follow You<br>
<br>
Lord, will You be my vision<br>
Lord, will You be my guide<br>
Be my hope, be my light and the way<br>
And I'll look not for riches, nor praises on earth<br>
Only You'll be the first of my heart<br>
<br>
For this is what I'm glad to do<br>
It's time to live a life of love that pleases You<br>
And I will give my all to You<br>
Surrender everything I have and follow You<br>
I'll follow You<br>
<br>
I will follow<br>
I will follow You<br>
<br>
For this is what I'm glad to do<br>
It's time to live a life of love that pleases You<br>
And I will give my all to You<br>
Surrender everything I have and follow You<br>
<br>
For this is what I'm glad to do<br>
It's time to live a life of love that pleases You<br>
And I will give my all to You<br>
Surrender everything I have and follow You<br>
I'll follow You<br>
<br>
I will follow<br>
I will follow You, Jesus<br>
<br>
I will take up my cross, Lord<br>
and will follow you<br>
You'll be my vision<br>
You'll be my guide<br>
I will follow You, follow You, follow You.<br>

John 9:25<br>
He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. <br>
<br>
<br>
The hymn,<br>
Amazing Grace<br>
was published in February 1779,<br>
and was intended to be a spiritual autobiography of its author, John Newton.<br>
<br>
John Newton was born in 1725, and died in 1807 at the age of 82.<br>
He was an British Anglican minister of the Christian church, who served as a sailor in the Royal Navy, and later as the captain of slave ships. <br>
After his retirement, he later regretted and rejected slavery after witnessing the horrors of it firsthand.<br>
<br>
In February 2019, this hymn was 240 years old.<br>
<br>
The hymn was published in a hymn book, Olney Hymns, in February 1779.<br>
It contained the works of John Newton<br>
and his poet friend, William Cowper (1731–1800). <br>
<br>
The city of Olney is a market town and civil parish, with a population of about seven thousand, in the Borough of Milton Keynes, in Buckinghamshire county, in South East England.<br>
<br>
<br>
When Amazing Grace was originally used in the city of Olney, it was unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. <br>
<br>
The hymnbooks of that day did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. <br>
<br>
The words of Amazing Grace were inserted into a few different songs until it was finally joined into the song, New Britain, in 1835.<br>
<br>
The song, "Amazing Grace" that is commonly sang today, is sang to the tune of the song, "New Britain" by William Walker, and this musical version was first published in a hymn book out of Philadelphia, in, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, in 1835.<br>
<br>
The first six verses were first published by John Newton in 1779,<br>
The last verse, that starts with, When we've been there ten thousand years,<br>
was added later on, by Harriet Elisabeth Beecher Stowe.<br>
No one knows who first came up with that last verse.<br>
She had heard that additional verse being passed down orally in African American communities,<br>
and she first had it published in 1852, when she included it in her anti-slavery novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin.<br>
<br>
It's interesting how, the original author, and the author who added the last verse, 73 years later, were both opposed to slavery.<br>
<br>
Here are the words of all seven verses of Amazing Grace.<br>
The first six were written by John Newton, and the seventh verse was officially included by Harriet Elisabeth Beecher Stowe.<br>
Again, know one knows who first created the seventh, additional, last verse that came from the African American community.<br>
<br>
<br>
1.<br>
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound <br>
that saved a wretch like me! <br>
I once was lost, but now am found; <br>
was blind, but now I see. <br>
<br>
2.<br>
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, <br>
and grace my fears relieved; <br>
how precious did that grace appear <br>
the hour I first believed. <br>
<br>
3.<br>
Through many dangers, toils, and snares, <br>
I have already come; <br>
'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, <br>
and grace will lead me home. <br>
<br>
4.<br>
The Lord has promised good to me, <br>
his word my hope secures; <br>
he will my shield and portion be, <br>
as long as life endures. <br>
<br>
5.<br>
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail, <br>
and mortal life shall cease, <br>
I shall possess, within the veil, <br>
a life of joy and peace. <br>
<br>
<br>
6.<br>
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,<br>
the sun forbear to shine;<br>
but God, who called me here below,<br>
will be forever mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
7.<br>
When we've been there ten thousand years, <br>
bright shining as the sun, <br>
we've no less days to sing God's praise <br>
than when we first begun. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Light and Darkness<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is a Bible Study about light.<br>
Light and darkness, darkness and light.<br>
<br>
When we did a Bible Study about times and seasons, you may recall the first part where we looked at these bits of scripture...<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 25:21 (KJV)<br>
His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 8:10 (KJV)<br>
...the joy of the Lord is your strength.<br>
<br>
John 15:15 (KJV) Jesus said...<br>
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 17:17 (KJV)<br>
A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.<br>
Proverbs 17:17 NLT:<br>
A friend is always loyal, and a brother is born to help in time of need.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Jesus is your friend, and a friend loves you at all times, and in all seasons.<br>
Whatever you are going through, a friend goes through it with you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 3: 17 KJV<br>
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,<br>
<br>
Ephesians 3: 16 & 17 (NLT)<br>
16 I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit. <br>
Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God's love and keep you strong.<br>
<br>
Colossians 3:16<br>
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. <br>
<br>
Colossians 3:16 & 17 NLT<br>
16 Let the message about Christ, in all its richness, fill your lives. Teach and counsel each other with all the wisdom he gives. Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful hearts. <br>
17 And whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through him to God the Father.<br>
<br>
1 John 4:12<br>
...If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. <br>
<br>
 1 John 4:15<br>
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. <br>
<br>
1 John 4:16<br>
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. <br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3:16 KJV<br>
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? <br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3:16 NLT<br>
16 Don't you realise that all of you together are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God lives in you (and lives amongst you)? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 4, verses 12 through 17, NLT<br>
...if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is brought to full expression in us.<br>
13 And God has given us his Spirit as proof that we live in him and he in us. <br>
14 Furthermore, we have seen with our own eyes and now testify that the Father sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. <br>
15 All who declare that Jesus is the Son of God have God living in them, and they live in God. <br>
16 We know how much God loves us, and we have put our trust in his love.<br>
God is love, and all who live in love, live in God, and God lives in them. <br>
17 And as we live in God, our love grows more perfect. So we will not be afraid on the day of judgement.<br>
<br>
1 John 4: 7 & 8 KJV<br>
7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<br>
8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 9:5 (KJV) (Jesus said,)<br>
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.<br>
<br>
John 8:12 (KJV)<br>
Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 2:5 (KJV)<br>
O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:17<br>
Pray without ceasing. <br>
<br>
<br>
The Bible tells us that we should never stop praying to Him.<br>
If the Lord God Jesus is your friend, how should you talk to Him?<br>
How should you pray to Him?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 33: 9 - 11 KJV<br>
9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.<br>
10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.<br>
11 And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.<br>
<br>
Exodus 33: 9 - 11 NLT:<br>
They would all watch Moses until he disappeared inside. <br>
9 As he went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and hover at its entrance whilst the Lord spoke with Moses. <br>
10 When the people saw the cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, they would stand and bow down in front of their own tents. <br>
11 Inside the Tent of Meeting, the Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Afterward, Moses would return to the camp.<br>
<br>
Exodus 34: verse 29, and then we jump to verses 33, 34, and 35 (KJV):<br>
29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone whilst he talked with him.<br>
33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.<br>
34 But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.<br>
35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Exodus 34, Verses 28 through 35<br>
28...The Lord, (he) wrote the terms of the covenant -- the Ten Commandments (the ten words) -- on the stone tablets.<br>
29 When Moses came down Mount Sinai carrying the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant, (carrying the two tablets of the Testimony,) he wasn't aware that his face had become radiant because he had spoken to the Lord. <br>
30 So, when Aaron and the people of Israel saw the radiance of Moses' face, they were afraid to come near him.<br>
31 But Moses called out to them and asked Aaron and all the leaders of the community to come over, and he talked with them. <br>
32 Then all the people of Israel approached him, and Moses gave them all the instructions the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai. <br>
33 When Moses finished speaking with them, he covered his face with a veil. <br>
34 But whenever he went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with the Lord, he would remove the veil until he came out again. Then he would give the people whatever instructions the Lord had given him, <br>
35 and the people of Israel would see the radiant glow of his face. So he would put the veil over his face until he returned to speak with the Lord.<br>
<br>
Commentary: <br>
The Lord uses everyone for his purposes, even those who are not saved and have rejected his free gift of salvation.<br>
They are being used by the Lord, as if they were God's servants, and they don't even know it.<br>
But if you are saved, Jesus does not call you a servant, he calls you his friend.<br>
Moses talked to the Lord God, as though he was talking to his friend, and the Lord talked to Moses as though God was talking to his friend.<br>
As a result of spending time with Him, talking to the Lord God, your Heavenly Father, the dad that you wished you always would have had,<br>
as a result of Moses talking to the Lord as though he was talking to his friend, Moses came out of the tent of meeting glowing.<br>
Spend time with the Lord.  Talk to Him. Pray to Him. Never stop praying, and you'll glow too.<br>
Really?<br>
What is a night light?  It gives off a glowing light in a dark place, so that anyone in the darkness can find their way.<br>
But, what good is a night light if it only gives off light when there is light around?<br>
If you had a night light that only turned on when the lights were on, would that night light be of much value to you?<br>
What good am I if I only talk about Jesus and the Bible when I am at church, or when I'm only around other Christians?<br>
<br>
Matthew 5: 46 & 47 (NLT)<br>
46 If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. <br>
47 If you are kind only to your friends, (your brothers,) how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Earlier, we read that Jesus said, "I am the light of the world."<br>
If He is the light of world, and this light now lives in you, and lives in your heart, guess what happens next?<br>
<br>
Matthew 5:14 (KJV)<br>
Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If you are in a dark forest, and you see the lights of a city on a hill, you can use those city lights to help you find your way to the city.<br>
In the city, there would be all kinds of resources to help you, such as food, water, a place to sleep and be safe, and get any medical attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5: 14 & 15 (NLT)<br>
14 "You are the light of the world -- like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. <br>
15 No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house.<br>
<br>
Psalms 18:28 (KJV)<br>
For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness. <br>
<br>
Psalms 18:28 (NLT)<br>
You light a lamp for me.<br>
The Lord, my God, lights up my darkness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5:16 (KJV)<br>
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 2:19 (KJV)<br>
And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 2:19 (NLT)<br>
...you are a guide for the blind and a light for people who are lost in darkness.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Think about that. Romans 2:19. Congratulations. You are a night light. That is the definition of what a night light does.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 1:17<br>
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. <br>
<br>
James 1: 16 & 17 NLT<br>
16 So don't be misled, my dear brothers and sisters. <br>
17 Whatever is good and perfect is a gift coming down to us from God our Father, who created all the lights in the heavens. He never changes or casts a shifting shadow.<br>
<br>
Looking at the original Greek wording, another way to say the NLT of verse 17 would be like this...<br>
17 Whatever is good and perfect is a gift coming down to us (from above, from the Father of lights. He never changes, as a shifting shadow does.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 60:1 (KJV)<br>
Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee. <br>
NLT:<br>
Let your light shine for all to see.<br>
For the glory of the Lord rises to shine on you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 60:1 is also talking about Jerusalem, the city on a hill that cannot be hid.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 1:5 (KJV)<br>
This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:105 (KJV)<br>
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. <br>
<br>
Proverbs 6:23 (KJV)<br>
For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:1 (KJV)<br>
The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:23 & 24 (KJV)<br>
And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.<br>
And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 22:5 (KJV)<br>
And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.<br>
<br>
(Some of the original Old Testament Hebrew or New Testament Greek meanings are repeated below within round brackets.)<br>
<br>
John 3: 19 - 21<br>
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.<br>
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.<br>
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.<br>
<br>
John 3: 16 - 21 NLT<br>
Everyone who believes will have eternal life in him.<br>
16 "For this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. <br>
(For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.)<br>
17 God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him.<br>
18 "There is no judgement against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God's one and only Son. <br>
19 And the judgement is based on this fact: God's light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil. <br>
20 All who do evil hate the light and refuse to go near it for fear their sins will be exposed. <br>
21 But those who do what is right come to the light so others can see that they are doing what God wants."<br>
(But those who do what is right come to the light so others can see God at work in what he is doing.)<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
<br>
Mercy: Not getting what you deserve.<br>
Grace: Getting what you don't deserve -- unmerited, undeserved, un-earned favour.<br>
Justice: Getting what you deserve.<br>
<br>
If you are saved, you get mercy and grace. As it said there in the NLT of John 3: 18 -- There is no judgement against anyone who believes in him.<br>
If you are not saved, you get justice and judgement.<br>
Judgement includes everything you have secretly thought of, desired or imagined in your mind, your entire life!<br>
Run all of that through the filter of the Ten Commandments and that is why we all need Jesus and His forgiveness.<br>
<br>
Before we continue, remember that Satan is the Prince of this world, the god of this world.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 4:4 (KJV)<br>
In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 4:3 - 12 (NLT)<br>
3 If the Good News we preach is hidden behind a veil, it is hidden only from people who are perishing. <br>
4 Satan, who is the god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don't believe. They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News. They don't understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God.<br>
5 You see, we don't go around preaching about ourselves. We preach that Jesus Christ is Lord, and we ourselves are your servants for Jesus' sake. <br>
6 For God, who said, "Let there be light in the darkness," has made this light shine in our hearts so we could know the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ.<br>
7 We now have this light shining in our hearts, but we ourselves are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure. This makes it clear that our great power is from God, not from ourselves.<br>
<br>
7 (We now have this treasure in clay jars.) This makes it clear that our great power is from God, not from ourselves.<br>
<br>
8 We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed. We are perplexed, but not driven to despair. <br>
9 We are hunted down, but never abandoned by God. We get knocked down, but we are not destroyed. <br>
10 Through suffering, our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies.<br>
11 Yes, we live under constant danger of death because we serve Jesus, so that the life of Jesus will be evident in our dying bodies. <br>
12 So we live in the face of death, but this has resulted in eternal life for you<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 13:47 (KJV)<br>
For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 4:6 (KJV)<br>
For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  <br>
If Jesus lives in your heart, you have His light living in your heart.<br>
Evil, unclean spirits, devils and demons can not be in your heart if you are saved, because when there is light, the darkness needs to flee.<br>
These demons can try to talk you down, with words of lies, fear and discouragement, but they cannot control or posses you, if you are a saved believer.<br>
If Jesus is not in your heart, other spirits can enter into you and take his place if he is not there.<br>
Saved, believing Christians have the power and authority to cast out demons, but if Jesus does not enter in afterwards, by doing Romans 10:9, what can then happen to an unsaved person with their empty, clean heart is that it becomes available for demonic spirits to enter back in, and they can invite additional demons to join them, making that unsaved person even worse than before. <br>
These possessed people end up doing the things that end up in the news more and more often these days. <br>
After you cast them out, you need to deliver the Gospel, the Good News, Romans 10:9, or else that person can end up being even more worse than before.<br>
<br>
Remember we have the power and authority in Jesus to pray this prayer:<br>
In the name of Jesus Christ, I command this evil spirit (of ______) to be cast out of this person, and to be sent to the dry places, never to return to this person again, never to be in or around this person ever again.<br>
In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.<br>
<br>
In the round brackets, in the blank spot right there, what could go in there?<br>
An evil spirit of Anger<br>
An evil spirit of Bitterness<br>
An evil spirit of Fear<br>
An evil spirit of Depression<br>
An evil spirit of Rejection<br>
An evil spirit of Accusation<br>
An evil spirit of Self-Opposition<br>
An evil spirit of Condemnation (which is not the same as Conviction)<br>
An evil spirit of Suicide<br>
An evil spirit of Sexual Immorality<br>
An evil spirit of Addiction<br>
An evil spirit of Unforgiveness<br>
An evil spirit of Pain and Sickness<br>
An evil spirit of _____________<br>
<br>
All of those are names that are below the name of Jesus.<br>
Even if you do not know the name of the demon that is below the name of Jesus, -- there are many of those demon names -- you do know the name above all names, Jesus Christ.<br>
You may not be able to write out the equation or the problem, but you do know the solution and answer to the problem.<br>
You don't even need a calculator.<br>
His name is Jesus.<br>
If you are saved or not saved, know this.<br>
Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.<br>
If you don't bow to Him now, you will bow to Him later.<br>
Make other people's interests more important than your own.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 2: 3 - 11 KJV<br>
3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<br>
4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.<br>
5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:<br>
6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:<br>
7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<br>
8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<br>
9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:<br>
10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;<br>
11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<br>
<br>
Philippians 2: 3 - 11 NLT<br>
3 Don't be selfish; don't try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves. <br>
4 Don't look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.<br>
5 You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.<br>
6<br>
(Being in the form of God,) Though he was God,<br>
he did not think of equality with God<br>
as something to cling to.<br>
7<br>
Instead, he gave up his divine privilege (he emptied himself);<br>
he took the humble position of a slave (he took the form of a slave)<br>
and was born as a human being.<br>
When he appeared in human form.<br>
8<br>
(When he appeared in human form,)<br>
he humbled himself in obedience to God<br>
and died a criminal's death on a cross.<br>
9<br>
Therefore, God elevated him to the place of highest honour<br>
and gave him the name above all other names,<br>
10<br>
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,<br>
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br>
11<br>
and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br>
to the glory of God the Father.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 1: 19 - 22 (KJV)<br>
<br>
19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,<br>
20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,<br>
21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:<br>
22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 1: 19 - 22 (NLT)<br>
19 I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God's power for us who believe him. This is the same mighty power <br>
20 that raised Christ from the dead and seated him in the place of honour at God's right hand in the heavenly realms. <br>
21 Now he is far above any ruler or authority or power or leader or anything else -- not only in this world but also in the world to come. <br>
22 God has put all things under the authority of Christ and has made him head over all things for the benefit of the church.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 4:12 KJV<br>
12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given amongst men, whereby we must be saved.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 4: 11 & 12 NLT<br>
Verse 11 is quoting from Psalm 118:22...<br>
'The stone that you builders rejected<br>
has now become the cornerstone.'<br>
12 There is salvation in no one else! God has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved."<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 1: 3 & 4 KJV<br>
3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;<br>
4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 1: verses 2, 3, and 4 NLT<br>
2 And now in these final days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God promised everything to the Son as an inheritance, and through the Son he created the universe. <br>
3 The Son radiates God's own glory and expresses the very character of God, and he sustains everything by the mighty power of his command. When he had cleansed us from our sins, he sat down in the place of honour at the right hand of the majestic God in heaven. <br>
4 This shows that the Son is far greater than the angels, just as the name God gave him is greater than their names.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  At night, when the lights are turned on in a room, the room cannot have darkness because the light is on, but you can look out the window at the darkness of the night outside.<br>
With the light of Jesus living in your heart, the darkness can not enter, but it can try to influence you from the outside.<br>
A great illustration of this is the story about Rab–shakeh, the trash-talkeh.<br>
You should read this story. It's so nice, they wrote it twice!<br>
The story begins in these two places...<br>
2 Kings 18, starting in verse 7<br>
Isaiah 36, starting in verse 1<br>
<br>
Rab–shakeh never actually makes it into the city, but he tries to send words of regret, defeat, hopelessness and discouragement from the outside.<br>
That's how demons try to operate with Christians because that can't possess them, they will try to oppress and depress with depressing words.<br>
When you say, "I am depressed," you are identifying yourself with an evil sprit of depression.<br>
When you want the depression to go away, don't welcome that spirit closer to you by saying what he says, "I am depressed."<br>
<br>
Commetary:  Like we mentioned earlier, We have the power to cast out demons in others, but if we don't get Jesus in there afterwards, with the Gospel, or Good News, the Bible tells us what can happen...<br>
<br>
Matthew 12: 43 - 45 KJV<br>
43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.<br>
44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.<br>
45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12: 43 - 45 NLT<br>
43 "When an evil (unclean) spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none. <br>
44 Then it says, 'I will return to the person I came from.' So it returns and finds its former home empty, swept, and in order. <br>
45 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before. That will be the experience of this evil generation."<br>
<br>
Commentary: Watch the news, and almost every day, someone kills some people, and then they kill themselves.<br>
Why? Demon possession.<br>
Why? Because, Jesus said, "Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. That will be the experience of this evil generation."<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11: 21 - 26 (KJV)<br>
21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:<br>
22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.<br>
23 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.<br>
24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.<br>
25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.<br>
26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11: 21 - 26 (NLT)<br>
20 But if I am casting out demons by the power of God (by the finger of God,) then the Kingdom of God has arrived amongst you. <br>
21 For when a strong man is fully armed and guards his palace, his possessions are safe--<br>
22 until someone even stronger attacks and overpowers him, strips him of his weapons, and carries off his belongings.<br>
23 "Anyone who is not with me opposes me, and anyone who is not working with me is actually working against me.<br>
24 "When an evil (unclean) spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, searching for rest. But when it finds none, it says, 'I will return to the person I came from.'<br>
25 So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order. <br>
26 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
How do you learn more about how to be a light and make your light shine?<br>
Read the Bible, every day, even if it's just a page a day.<br>
Pray every day, talking to the Lord as though you are talking to your friend.<br>
As we now bring this Bible Study to a close, let's look again at...<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:105<br>
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. <br>
<br>
Psalms 119 NLT<br>
104<br>
Your commandments give me understanding;<br>
no wonder I hate every false way of life.<br>
<br>
105<br>
Your word is a lamp to guide my feet<br>
and a light for my path.<br>
<br>
Finally, here is one last verse to think about, which describes our present end-times, and then a short little prayer.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 5:20 (NLT)<br>
What sorrow for those who say that evil is good and good is evil, that dark is light and light is dark, that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let us pray.<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, help me to be a light and shine your light into the darkness, so that, those lost in the darkness, and desire to not be in the darkness anymore, can use the light to guide them home to you.<br>
We pray this, in the name of Jesus, Amen.<br>

A poem based on Romans 10:9<br>
<br>
If you confess and believe in your heart<br>
That Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins<br>
And that God raised Him up from the grave<br>
You will be Saved<br>
You shall be Saved<br>
<br>
If you say it out loud with your mouth<br>
And you believe that it's true in your heart<br>
that Jesus Christ<br>
is LORD<br>
You will be Saved<br>
You shall be saved<br>
<br>
If you confess and believe in your heart<br>
That Yaw-Who-Shaw died on the cross for your sins<br>
And that EE-Low-Heem raised Him up from the grave<br>
You will be Saved<br>
You shall be Saved<br>
<br>
If you say it out loud with your mouth<br>
And you believe that it's true in your heart<br>

<p>
<br>
The Prayer of Saint Francis<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is an interesting prayer.<br>
This prayer is not in the Bible, but it is a good prayer to read.<br>
This prayer was first published in a magazine in France in the year 1912, but nobody knows who first wrote it.<br>
The magazine's copyright has expired.<br>
Many people call this the Prayer of Saint Francis, but the actual person, the Italian Saint Francis of Assisi, died about 686 years earlier, in the year 1226.<br>
<br>
Assisi is a city and small area in the central, north east area of Italy.<br>
Saint Francis did not write this prayer.<br>
<br>
Since the prayer was originally published in French, here is the English translation.<br>
<br>
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.<br>
Where there is hatred, let me bring love.<br>
Where there is offence, let me bring pardon.<br>
Where there is discord, let me bring union.<br>
Where there is error, let me bring truth.<br>
Where there is doubt, let me bring faith.<br>
Where there is despair, let me bring hope.<br>
Where there is darkness, let me bring your light.<br>
Where there is sadness, let me bring joy.<br>
O Master, let me not seek as much<br>
to be consoled as to console,<br>
to be understood as to understand,<br>
to be loved as to love,<br>
for it is in giving that one receives,<br>
it is in self-forgetting that one finds,<br>
it is in pardoning that one is pardoned,<br>
it is in dying that one is raised to eternal life.<br>

<br>
Doxology<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
According to Wikipedia in 2018,<br>
A doxology is a short hymn of praises to God in various forms of Christian worship, often added to the end of a hymn, psalm or other song of praise taken from biblical or holy texts other than the Bible's book of Psalms.<br>
<br>
There are several Christian doxologies.  Each one has a story and history behind it.<br>

Psalms 68: 3 - 6 (KJV)<br>
3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice, (let them exceedingly rejoice with gladness.)<br>
4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah, and rejoice before him.<br>
5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.<br>
6 (God setteth the solitary in a house,) God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 68: 3 - 6 (NLT)<br>
3<br>
But let the godly rejoice.<br>
Let them be glad in God's presence.<br>
Let them be filled with joy.<br>
4<br>
Sing praises to God and to his name!<br>
Sing loud praises to him who rides the clouds.<br>
(Sing loud praises to him who rides through the deserts.)<br>
His name is the Lord--<br>
rejoice in his presence!<br>

Father to the fatherless, defender of widows--<br>

...be at peace amongst yourselves.<br>
14 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.<br>
15 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both amongst yourselves, and to all men.<br>
16 Rejoice evermore.<br>
17 Pray without ceasing.<br>
18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.<br>
19 Quench not the Spirit.<br>
20 Despise not prophesyings.<br>
21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.<br>
22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.<br>
23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>

1 Thessalonians 5: 13 - 25 NLT<br>

14 Brothers and sisters, we urge you to warn those who are lazy. Encourage those who are timid. Take tender care of those who are weak. Be patient with everyone.<br>
15 See that no one pays back evil for evil, but always try to do good to each other and to all people.<br>
16 Always be joyful. <br>
17 Never stop praying. <br>
18 Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.<br>

20 Do not scoff at prophecies, <br>
21 but test everything that is said. Hold on to what is good. <br>
22 Stay away from every kind of evil.<br>
23 Now may the God of peace make you holy in every way, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again. <br>
24 God will make this happen, for he who calls you is faithful.<br>

The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. <br>
These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 5:20 (NLT)<br>
What sorrow for those who say that evil is good and good is evil, that dark is light and light is dark, that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 8:14 (NLT)<br>
And this is not all that is meaningless in our world. In this life, good people are often treated as though they were wicked, and wicked people are often treated as though they were good. This is so meaningless!<br>
<br>
<br>
Amos 5:15 (NLT)<br>
Hate evil and love what is good;<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 15:34 (NLT)<br>
Think carefully about what is right, and stop sinning. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:24 (NLT)<br>
Anyone who steals from his father and mother and says, "What's wrong with that?" is no better than a murderer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 55:2 (NLT)<br>
Why spend your money on food that does not give you strength? Why pay for food that does you no good?<br>

Here are the words to Lauren Daigle's song, You Say...<br>
<br>
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough<br>
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up<br>
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?<br>
Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know<br>
<br>
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br>
You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br>
And You say I am held when I am falling short<br>
And when I don't belong, oh You say I am Yours<br>
And I believe, oh I believe<br>
What You say of me<br>
I believe<br>
<br>
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me<br>
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity, o-ooh<br>
<br>
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br>
You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br>
And You say I am held when I am falling short<br>
And when I don't belong, oh You say I am Yours<br>
And I believe, oh I believe<br>
What You say of me<br>
Oh, I believe<br>
<br>
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet<br>
You have every failure God, and You'll have every victory, o-ooh<br>
<br>
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br>
You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br>
You say I am held when I am falling short<br>
When I don't belong, oh You say I am Yours<br>
And I believe, oh I believe<br>
What You say of me<br>
I believe<br>
<br>
Oh I believe<br>
Yes I believe<br>
What You say of me<br>
Oh I believe<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
These are Bible verses that the song, You Say, is based on,<br>
and we also have here some Bible verses that could be used in argument against this song.<br>
<br>
John 8:10-12<br>
(the end of a story about A Woman Caught in Adultery)<br>
KJV<br>
10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?<br>
11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.<br>
12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<br>
<br>
John 8: 7-12<br>
NLT<br>
7 They kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, "All right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!" <br>
8 Then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust.<br>
9 When the accusers heard this, they slipped away one by one, beginning with the oldest, until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman. <br>
10 Then Jesus stood up again and said to the woman, "Where are your accusers? Didn't even one of them condemn you?"<br>
11 "No, Lord," she said.<br>
And Jesus said, "Neither do I. Go and sin no more."<br>
12 Jesus spoke to the people once more and said, "I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won't have to walk in darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life."<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 2:1-2<br>
KJV<br>
1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:<br>
2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.<br>
<br>
1 John 2:1-2<br>
NLT<br>
1 My dear children, I am writing this to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate who pleads our case before the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the one who is truly righteous. <br>
2 He himself is the sacrifice that atones for our sins -- and not only our sins but the sins of all the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:16<br>
KJV<br>
16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4: 14-16<br>
NLT<br>
14 So then, since we have a great High Priest who has entered heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we believe. <br>
15 This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet he did not sin. <br>
16 So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
It is called The Law.  If you break any law, you have broken the law, even though there are many rules that make up what we refer to as the law.<br>
It's kind of like a chocolate bar.<br>
If you break any part of a chocolate bar, even it is only one small break, the entire chocolate bar is considered broken.<br>
So, if you only broke a little corner or section, and kept most of it intact, you have still broken the chocolate bar, and it is still considered broken.<br>
<br>
James 2:10-13<br>
KJV<br>
10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.<br>
11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.<br>
12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.<br>
13 For he shall have judgement without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgement.<br>
<br>
James 2: 8-13<br>
NLT<br>
8 Yes indeed, it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the Scriptures: "Love your neighbour as yourself." (Lev 19:18.)<br>
9 But if you favour some people over others, you are committing a sin. You are guilty of breaking the law.<br>
10 For the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God's laws. <br>
11 For the same God who said, "You must not commit adultery," also said, "You must not murder."<br>
(Verse 11 is referring to Exodus 20:13-14; and Deuteronomy 5:17-18)<br>
So if you murder someone but do not commit adultery, you have still broken the law.<br>
12 So whatever you say or whatever you do, remember that you will be judged by the law that sets you free. <br>
13 There will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others. But if you have been merciful, God will be merciful when he judges you.<br>
<br>

<br>
Romans 3: 21-26 <br>
KJV<br>
21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;<br>
22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:<br>
23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br>
24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:<br>
25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<br>
26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.<br>
<br>
Romans 3: 20-28<br>
NLT<br>
20 For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands. The law simply shows us how sinful we are.<br>
21 But now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the requirements of the law, as was promised (in the law,) in the writings of Moses and the prophets long ago. <br>
22 We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are.<br>
23 For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God's glorious standard. <br>
24 Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins. <br>
25 For God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life, shedding his blood. This sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past, <br>
26 for he was looking ahead and including them in what he would do in this present time. God did this to demonstrate his righteousness, for he himself is fair and just, and he makes sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus.<br>
27 Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on obeying the law. It is based on faith. <br>
28 So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 3: 15-18<br>
KJV<br>
15 Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.<br>
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>
17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.<br>
18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 3: 15-18<br>
NLT<br>
15 Everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.<br>
(Everyone who believes will have eternal life in him.)<br>
(For God loved the world so much that he gave.)<br>
16 "For this is how God loved the world: He gave so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. <br>
17 God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him.<br>
18 "There is no judgement against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God's one and only Son.<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 12:9-10 <br>
KJV<br>
9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br>
10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 12: 7-10<br>
NLT<br>
To keep me from becoming proud, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud.<br>
8 Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away. <br>
9 Each time he said, "My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness." So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me. <br>
10 That's why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1:26-29<br>
KJV<br>
26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:<br>
27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;<br>
28 And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:<br>
29 That no flesh should glory in his presence.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1:26-31 NLT<br>
26 Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world's eyes or powerful or wealthy (or high born,) when God called you. <br>
27 Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful. <br>
(God chose those who are low born.)<br>
28 God chose things despised by the world, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important. <br>
29 As a result, no one can ever boast in the presence of God.<br>
30 God has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made him to be wisdom itself. Christ made us right with God; he made us pure and holy, and he freed us from sin. <br>
31 Therefore, as the Scriptures say, "If you want to boast, boast only about the Lord." (Jer 9:24).<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 9: 23 & 24 KJV<br>
23 Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:<br>
24 But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgement, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 9: 23 & 24 NLT<br>
23<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Don't let the wise boast in their wisdom,<br>
or the powerful boast in their power,<br>
or the rich boast in their riches.<br>
24<br>
But those who wish to boast<br>
should boast in this alone:<br>
that they truly know me and understand that I am the Lord<br>
who demonstrates unfailing love<br>
and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth,<br>
and that I delight in these things.<br>
I, the Lord, have spoken!<br>
<br>

John 16:7-15<br>
KJV<br>
7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.<br>
8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgement:<br>
9 Of sin, because they believe not on me;<br>
10 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;<br>
11 Of judgement, because the prince of this world is judged.<br>
12 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.<br>
13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.<br>
14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<br>
15 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<br>
<br>
John 16:7-15<br>
NLT<br>
7 But in fact, it is best for you that I go away, because if I don't, the Advocate won't come. If I do go away, then I will send him to you. <br>
Commentary: Verse 7 here is talking about the Holy Spirit.  The advocate is the holy spirit or holy ghost. If Jesus goes away, and ascends up into heaven, which He did, then Jesus is saying here that He will send the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, to you, which we see happen in the next book of Acts.<br>
(It is best for you that I go away, because if I don't, the Advocate (the Comforter, Encourager, or Counsellor -- the original Greek word there for Advocate is Paraclete --  the Paraclete won't come. If I do go away, then I will send him to you.) <br>
8 And when he comes, he will convict the world of its sin, and of God's righteousness, and of the coming judgement. <br>
9 The world's sin is that it refuses to believe in me. <br>
10 Righteousness is available because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more. <br>
11 Judgement will come because the ruler of this world has already been judged.<br>
12 "There is so much more I want to tell you, but you can't bear it now. <br>
13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own but will tell you what he has heard. He will tell you about the future. <br>
14 He will bring me glory by telling you whatever he receives from me. <br>
15 All that belongs to the Father is mine; this is why I said, 'The Spirit will tell you whatever he receives from me.'<br>
<br>

Luke 9:23 <br>
KJV<br>
23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.<br>
<br>
Luke 9:23, 24, and 25 -- NLT<br>
23 Then he said to the crowd, "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross daily, and follow me. <br>
24 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it. <br>
25 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but are yourself lost or destroyed?<br>

John 5:39-40<br>
KJV -- Jesus was talking to the Jewish leaders when he said...<br>
39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.<br>
40 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 5:38-44<br>
NLT -- Jesus was talking to the Jewish leaders when he said...<br>
38 you do not have his message in your hearts, because you do not believe me -- the one he sent to you.<br>
39 "You search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. But the Scriptures point to me! <br>
40 Yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life.<br>
41 "Your approval means nothing to me, <br>
42 because I know you don't have God's love within you. <br>
43 For I have come to you in my Father's name, and you have rejected me. Yet if others come in their own name, you gladly welcome them. <br>
44 No wonder you can't believe! For you gladly honour each other, but you don't care about the honour that comes from the one (the only One) who alone is God.<br>

26 But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:<br>
27 To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.<br>

Romans 16:24-27<br>
NLT<br>
24 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.<br>
25 Now all glory to God, who is able to make you strong, just as my Good News says. This message about Jesus Christ has revealed his plan for you Gentiles, a plan kept secret from the beginning of time. <br>
26 (But now, as the prophetic writings foretold,) but now as the prophets foretold and as the eternal God has commanded, this message is made known to all Gentiles everywhere, so that they too might believe and obey him. <br>
27 All glory to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, forever. Amen.<br>

Matthew 12: 30-33 KJV<br>
30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.<br>
31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.<br>
32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.<br>
33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.<br>

30 "Anyone who isn't with me opposes me, and anyone who isn't working with me is actually working against me.<br>
31 "So I tell you, every sin and blasphemy can be forgiven -- except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which will never be forgiven. <br>
32 Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to come.<br>
33 "A tree is identified by its fruit. If a tree is good, its fruit will be good. If a tree is bad, its fruit will be bad.<br>

We have many Bible studies that quote a verse here and there out of Psalms Chapter 34.<br>
We will now read All of Psalms Chapter 34, all 22 verses, first in the KJV and then in the NLT.<br>
Later on, at a random moment towards the end of Christian Essays 26,<br>
we will read All of Psalms 34 again in The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) translation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34 (KJV)<br>
A Psalm of David, when he changed his behaviour before (Achish, also known as,) Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.<br>
<br>
1 I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.<br>
2 My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.<br>
3 O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.<br>
4 I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.<br>
(They looked unto him, and they flowed unto him: and their faces were not ashamed.)<br>
5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.<br>
6 This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.<br>
7 The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.<br>
8 O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.<br>
9 O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.<br>
10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.<br>
11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.<br>
12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?<br>
13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.<br>
14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.<br>
15 The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.<br>
16 The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.<br>
17 The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.<br>
18 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.<br>
(The Lord is nigh to the broken of heart; and saveth such as be contrite of spirit.)<br>
<br>
19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.<br>
20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.<br>
21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate (they that hate the righteous shall be guilty.)<br>
22 The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate (none of them that trust in him shall be guilty.)<br>

I will constantly speak his praises.<br>
2<br>
I will boast only in the Lord;<br>
let all who are helpless take heart.<br>
3<br>
Come, let us tell of the Lord's greatness;<br>
let us exalt his name together.<br>
4<br>
I prayed to the Lord, and he answered me.<br>
He freed me from all my fears.<br>
5<br>
Those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy;<br>
no shadow of shame will darken their faces.<br>
6<br>
In my desperation I prayed, and the Lord listened;<br>
he saved me from all my troubles.<br>
7<br>
For the angel of the Lord is a guard;<br>
he surrounds and defends all who fear him.<br>
8<br>
Taste and see that the Lord is good.<br>
Oh, the joys of those who take refuge in him!<br>
9<br>
Fear the Lord, you his godly people,<br>
for those who fear him will have all they need.<br>
10<br>
Even strong young lions sometimes go hungry,<br>
but those who trust in the Lord will lack no good thing.<br>
11<br>
Come, my children, and listen to me,<br>
and I will teach you to fear the Lord.<br>
12<br>
Does anyone want to live a life<br>
that is long and prosperous?<br>
13<br>
Then keep your tongue from speaking evil<br>
and your lips from telling lies!<br>
14<br>
Turn away from evil and do good.<br>
Search for peace, and work to maintain it.<br>
15<br>
The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right;<br>
his ears are open to their cries for help.<br>
16<br>
But the Lord turns his face against those who do evil;<br>
he will erase their memory from the earth.<br>
17<br>
The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.<br>
He rescues them from all their troubles.<br>
18<br>
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted;<br>
he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.<br>
19<br>
The righteous person faces many troubles,<br>
but the Lord comes to the rescue each time.<br>
20<br>
For the Lord protects the bones of the righteous;<br>
not one of them is broken!<br>
21<br>
Calamity will surely destroy the wicked,<br>
and those who hate the righteous will be punished.<br>
22<br>
But the Lord will redeem those who serve him.<br>
No one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 5:24 KJV<br>
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. <br>
<br>
Romans 8:1 KJV<br>
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. <br>

<br>
A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.<br>
1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is<br>
(my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and weary land without water)<br>
2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.<br>
3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.<br>
4 Thus will I bless thee whilst I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.<br>
5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips<br>
6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.<br>
7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.<br>
8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.<br>
<br>
Psalms 63:  Verses 1 through 8 NLT<br>
A psalm of David, regarding a time when David was in the wilderness of Judah.<br>
1<br>
O God, you are my God;<br>
I earnestly search for you.<br>
My soul thirsts for you;<br>
my whole body longs for you<br>
in this parched and weary land<br>
where there is no water.<br>
2<br>
I have seen you in your sanctuary<br>
and gazed upon your power and glory.<br>
3<br>
Your unfailing love is better than life itself;<br>
how I praise you!<br>
4<br>
I will praise you as long as I live,<br>
lifting up my hands to you in prayer.<br>
5<br>
You satisfy me more than the richest feast.<br>
I will praise you with songs of joy.<br>
6<br>
I lie awake thinking of you,<br>
meditating on you through the night.<br>
7<br>
Because you are my helper,<br>
I sing for joy in the shadow of your wings.<br>
8<br>
I cling to you;<br>
your strong right hand holds me securely.<br>

2 Thessalonians 1: 4-12 (KJV)<br>
4 So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:<br>
5 Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgement of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:<br>
6 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;<br>
7 And to you who are troubled, rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,<br>
8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:<br>
9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;<br>
10 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony amongst you was believed) in that day.<br>
11 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:<br>
12 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 1: 4-12 (NLT)<br>
4 We proudly tell God's other churches about your endurance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and hardships you are suffering. <br>
5 And God will use this persecution to show his justice and to make you worthy of his Kingdom, for which you are suffering. <br>
6 In his justice he will pay back those who persecute you.<br>
7 And God will provide rest for you who are being persecuted and also for us when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven. He will come with his mighty angels, <br>
8 in flaming fire, bringing judgement on those who don't know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus. <br>
9 They will be punished with eternal destruction, forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power. <br>
10 When he comes on that day, he will receive glory from his holy people -- praise from all who believe. And this includes you, for you believed what we told you about him.<br>
11 So we keep on praying for you, asking our God to enable you to live a life worthy of his call. May he give you the power to accomplish all the good things your faith prompts you to do. <br>
12 Then the name of our Lord Jesus will be honoured because of the way you live, and you will be honoured along with him. This is all made possible because of the grace of our God and (our) Lord, Jesus Christ.<br>

John 16: 32 & 33<br>
KJV<br>
"...I am not alone, because the Father is with me.<br>
33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.<br>
<br>
John 16: 32 & 33<br>
NLT<br>
"...I am not alone because the Father is with me. <br>
33 I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I have overcome the world."<br>
<br>
Commentary: The Bible indicates and promises here and elsewhere that, as a Christian, you will have many spiritual attacks, afflictions, troubles, trials, tribulations, persecutions, pain, sufferings, and sorrows.<br>
But, with Jesus having put onto you the full armour of God, and with Jesus giving you power, love and a sound mind, be bold, brave and courageous, be of good cheer and take heart, because Jesus Christ has overcome the world, giving us victory, making us more than conquerors through Jesus.<br>
<br>
Matthew 28:18 (KJV)<br>
And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.<br>
<br>
Romans 8:37<br>
Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. <br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 15:57<br>
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. <br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 4: 12-19 KJV<br>
12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:<br>
13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.<br>
14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.<br>
15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.<br>
16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.<br>
17 For the time is come that judgement must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?<br>
18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?<br>
19 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 4: 12-19 NLT<br>
12 Dear friends, don't be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through, as if something strange were happening to you. <br>
13 Instead, be very glad -- for these trials make you partners with Christ in his suffering, so that you will have the wonderful joy of seeing his glory when it is revealed to all the world.<br>
14 If you are insulted because you bear the name of Christ, you will be blessed, for the glorious Spirit of God rests upon you.<br>
(If you are insulted because you bear the name of Christ, you will be blessed, for the glory of God, which is his Spirit, rests upon you. On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified. <br>
<br>
15 If you suffer, however, it must not be for murder, stealing, making trouble, or prying into other people's affairs. <br>
16 But it is no shame to suffer for being a Christian. Praise God for the privilege of being called by his name! <br>
17 For the time has come for judgement, and it must begin with God's household. And if judgement begins with us, what terrible fate awaits those who have never obeyed God's Good News? <br>
18<br>
And also,<br>
"If the righteous are barely saved,<br>
what will happen to godless sinners?"<br>
(from Proverbs 11:31, Greek version).<br>
19<br>
So if you are suffering in a manner that pleases God, keep on doing what is right, and trust your lives to the God who created you, for he will never fail you.<br>
<br>
<br>

Exodus 14: 13 & 14 KJV<br>
13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.<br>
(for whereas ye have seen the Egyptians to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.)<br>
14 The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.<br>
<br>
Exodus 14: 13 & 14 NLT<br>
13 But Moses told the people, "Don't be afraid. Just stand still and watch the Lord rescue you today. The Egyptians you see today will never be seen again. <br>
14 The Lord himself will fight for you. Just stay calm."<br>

Psalms 25:18 (KJV)<br>
Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.<br>

<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 15: 16-21 (KJV)<br>
16 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts.<br>
(for thy name is called upon me, O Lord God of hosts.)<br>
17 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.<br>
18 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail, (as waters that be not sure)?<br>
19 Therefore thus saith the Lord, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.<br>
20 And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the Lord.<br>
21 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 15: 16-21 (NLT)<br>
16<br>
When I discovered your words, I devoured them.<br>
They are my joy and my heart's delight,<br>
for I bear your name,<br>
O Lord God of Heaven's Armies.<br>
17<br>
I never joined the people in their merry feasts.<br>
I sat alone because your hand was on me.<br>
I was filled with indignation at their sins.<br>
18<br>
Why then does my suffering continue?<br>
Why is my wound so incurable?<br>
Your help seems as uncertain as a seasonal brook,<br>
like a spring that has gone dry."<br>
19<br>
This is how the Lord responds:<br>
"If you return to me, I will restore you<br>
so you can continue to serve me.<br>
If you speak good words rather than worthless ones,<br>
you will be my spokesman.<br>
You must influence them;<br>
do not let them influence you!<br>
20<br>
They will fight against you like an attacking army,<br>
but I will make you as secure as a fortified wall of bronze.<br>
They will not conquer you,<br>
for I am with you to protect and rescue you.<br>
I, the Lord, have spoken!<br>
21<br>
Yes, I will certainly keep you safe from these wicked men.<br>
I will rescue you from their cruel hands."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 104: 27-35<br>
KJV<br>
27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.<br>
28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.<br>
29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.<br>
30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.<br>
31 (The glory of the Lord shall be for ever.) The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works.<br>
32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.<br>
33 I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God whilst I have my being.<br>
34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the Lord.<br>
35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. Praise ye the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 104: 27-35<br>
NLT<br>
27<br>
They all depend on you<br>
to give them food as they need it.<br>
28<br>
When you supply it, they gather it.<br>
You open your hand to feed them,<br>
and they are richly satisfied.<br>
29<br>
But if you turn away from them, they panic.<br>
When you take away their breath,<br>
they die and turn again to dust.<br>
30<br>
(When you send your Spirit,) when you give them your breath, life is created,<br>
and you renew the face of the earth.<br>
31<br>
May the glory of the Lord continue forever!<br>
The Lord takes pleasure in all he has made!<br>
32<br>
The earth trembles at his glance;<br>
the mountains smoke at his touch.<br>
33<br>
I will sing to the Lord as long as I live.<br>
I will praise my God to my last breath!<br>
34<br>
May all my thoughts be pleasing to him,<br>
for I rejoice in the Lord.<br>
35<br>
Let all sinners vanish from the face of the earth;<br>
let the wicked disappear forever.<br>
Let all that I am praise the Lord.<br>
Praise the Lord!<br>

Hebrews 1: 1-10<br>
KJV<br>
1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,<br>
2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;<br>
3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;<br>
4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.<br>
5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?<br>
6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.<br>
7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.<br>
8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.<br>
9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 1: 1-10<br>
NLT<br>
<br>
1 Long ago God spoke many times and in many ways to our ancestors through the prophets. <br>
2 And now in these final days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God promised everything to the Son as an inheritance, and through the Son he created the universe. <br>
3 The Son radiates God's own glory and expresses the very character of God, and he sustains everything by the mighty power of his command. When he had cleansed us from our sins, he sat down in the place of honour at the right hand of the majestic God in heaven. <br>
4 This shows that the Son is far greater than the angels, just as the name God gave him is greater than their names.<br>
5<br>
For God never said to any angel what he said to Jesus:<br>
"You are my Son.<br>
Today I have become your Father."<br>
(Today I reveal you as my Son.)<br>
(Psalms 2:7)<br>
God also said,<br>
"I will be his Father,<br>
and he will be my Son."<br>
(2 Samuel 7:14.)<br>
6<br>
And when he brought his supreme (firstborn) Son into the world, God said, "Let all of God's angels worship him."<br>
When he again brings his supreme Son (his firstborn Son) into the world, God will say, "Let all of God's angels worship him."<br>
(from Deuteronomy 32:43.)<br>
7<br>
Regarding the angels, he says,<br>
"He sends his angels like the winds,<br>
his servants like flames of fire."<br>
(Psalms 104:4, Greek version)<br>
8<br>
But to the Son he says,<br>
“Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever.<br>
You rule with a sceptre of justice.<br>
9<br>
You love justice and hate evil.<br>
Therefore, O God, your God has anointed you,<br>
pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else."<br>
(Psalms 45:6-7.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Jesus Christ is the Lord and Saviour of my life.<br>
When you get saved, He is your Saviour, but have you made Him your Lord as well?<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 4: 16-21<br>
KJV<br>
16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.<br>
17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,<br>
18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,<br>
19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.<br>
20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.<br>
21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.<br>
<br>
Luke 4: 16-21<br>
NLT<br>
16 When (Jesus) came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures. <br>
17 The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where this was written:<br>
18<br>
"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br>
for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor.<br>
He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released,<br>
that the blind will see,<br>
that the oppressed will be set free,<br>
19 and that the time of the Lord's favour has come, and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."<br>
(Jesus was quoting from Isaiah 61:1-2, Greek version, and Isaiah 58:6.)<br>
20 He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue looked at him intently. <br>
21 Then he began to speak to them. "The Scripture you've just heard has been fulfilled this very day!"<br>

According to Wikipedia in 2018, Hillsong Young & Free (also known as Hillsong Y&F or simply Y&F) is an Australian contemporary worship music group from Sydney, Australia.<br>
They started at Hillsong Church, making Christian music since 2012.<br>
<br>
Their fourth album was their first studio album.  Their previous three albums were recordings from live concerts.<br>
Their fourth album is titled, III (Three), and was released on 29 June 2018.<br>
<br>
There is an interesting song on that album, called, First Love.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
From the band,<br>
Hillsong Young & Free <br>
Here are the words to their song,<br>
"First Love"<br>
<br>
This is all I want<br>
That the love I have for You<br>
Doesn't fade along with youth<br>
Can You help with that<br>
The reason that I ask<br>
I've seen far too many friends<br>
Walk away and not come back<br>
I want more than that<br>
<br>
I won't wash away<br>
Like branches in rain<br>
I'd rather be kindling in the light<br>
<br>
Set me on fire like I've never known<br>
I want to love You more as life goes on<br>
So all of my days I'll place<br>
My first love first again<br>
<br>
This is all I pray<br>
Over everything I ask<br>
That my friends one day come back<br>
Can You help with that<br>
God I know You can<br>
'Cause the fire won't mean a thing<br>
If it ends right here with me<br>
You want more than that<br>
<br>
The river runs fast<br>
But You wait at the banks<br>
And pull us like driftwood from the wild<br>
<br>
So set me on fire like I've never known<br>
I want to love You more as life goes on<br>
So all of my days I'll place<br>
My first love first again<br>
Once I was drifting but You called me home<br>
So I'll give my life for the ones still lost<br>
And I'll see my friends reclaim<br>
Their first love first again<br>
<br>
So set me on fire like I've never known<br>
I want to love You more as life goes on<br>
And all of my days I'll place<br>
My first love first again<br>
Once I was drifting but You called me home<br>
So I'll give my life for the ones still lost<br>
And I'll see my friends reclaim<br>
Their first love first again<br>
<br>
You'll see this world return<br>
And Your first love love You first<br>
<br>

Here are the words to the song titled,<br>
"Every Little Thing"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Your favour waits within the future<br>
My dreams are small<br>
Compared to Yours<br>
Why should I worry about tomorrow<br>
When I know<br>
That all I gotta do is trust You Lord<br>
<br>
<br>
Every little thing is gonna be alright<br>
Every little thing is gonna be just fine<br>
<br>
Whether I can see it now<br>
I know You will work it out for good<br>
Every little thing<br>
Everything will be alright<br>
<br>
<br>
Behind the scenes and in the details<br>
You plan the perfect way for me<br>
Why would I dwell upon<br>
The road's uncertainties<br>
When all I gotta do is look to You<br>
Yeah all I gotta do is look to You<br>
<br>
<br>
Whether I can see it now<br>
I know You will work it out for good<br>
<br>
Every little thing<br>
Everything will be alright<br>

Every little thing is gonna be alright<br>
Every little thing is gonna be just fine<br>

Proverbs 22:24 & 25 (KJV)<br>
24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:<br>
25 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 22:24 & 25 (NLT)<br>
24<br>
Don't befriend angry people<br>
or associate with hot-tempered people,<br>

Revelation 19: 11-16 (KJV)<br>
11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.<br>
12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.<br>
13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.<br>
14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.<br>
15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.<br>
16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND Lord OF LORDS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 19: 11-16 (NLT)<br>
11 Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. Its rider was named Faithful and True, for he judges fairly and wages a righteous war. <br>
12 His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself. <br>
13 He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title was the Word of God. <br>
14 The armies of heaven, dressed in the finest of pure white linen, followed him on white horses. <br>
15 From his mouth came a sharp sword to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He will release the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty, like juice flowing from a winepress. <br>
16 On his robe at his thigh (or, On his robe and thigh) was written this title: King of all kings and Lord of all lords.<br>

<br>
Luke 2: 12-14 (NLT)<br>
12 And you will recognise him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger."<br>
13 Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others -- the armies of heaven -- praising God and saying,<br>
14 "Glory to God in highest heaven,<br>
and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 51-53 (KJV)<br>
51 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:<br>
52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.<br>
53 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 51-53 (NLT)<br>
51 Do you think I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I have come to divide people against each other! <br>
52 From now on families will be split apart, three in favour of me, and two against -- or two in favour and three against.<br>
53
'Father will be divided against son<br>
and son against father;<br>
mother against daughter<br>
and daughter against mother;<br>
and mother-in-law against daughter-in-law<br>
and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.'<br>

Matthew 10: 32-42 (KJV)<br>
32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.<br>
33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.<br>
34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.<br>
35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.<br>
36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.<br>
37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.<br>
38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.<br>
39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.<br>
40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.<br>
41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.<br>
42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.<br>

<br>
Matthew 10: 32-42 (NLT)<br>
32 "Everyone who acknowledges me publicly here on earth, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. <br>
33 But everyone who denies me here on earth, I will also deny before my Father in heaven.<br>
34 "Don't imagine that I came to bring peace to the earth! I came not to bring peace, but a sword.<br>
35<br>
'I have come to set a man against his father,<br>
a daughter against her mother,<br>
and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.<br>
36<br>
Your enemies will be right in your own household!'<br>
(referring again to what is said in Micah 7:6, which we will look at here in just a moment.)<br><br>
<br>
37 "If you love your father or mother more than you love me, you are not worthy of being mine; or if you love your son or daughter more than me, you are not worthy of being mine. <br>
38 If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, you are not worthy of being mine. <br>
39 If you cling to your life, you will lose it; but if you give up your life for me, you will find it.<br>
40 "Anyone who receives you receives me, and anyone who receives me receives the Father who sent me. <br>
41 If you receive a prophet as one who speaks for God, (if you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet,) you will be given the same reward as a prophet. And if you receive righteous people because of their righteousness, you will be given a reward like theirs. <br>
42 And if you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers, you will surely be rewarded."<br>

<br>
Micah 7: 4-8 (KJV)<br>
4 The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.<br>
5 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.<br>
6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.<br>
7 Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.<br>
8 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 4-8 (NLT)<br>
4<br>
Even the best of them is like a brier;<br>
the most honest is as dangerous as a hedge of thorns.<br>
But your judgement day is coming swiftly now.<br>
Your time of punishment is here, a time of confusion.<br>
5<br>
Don't trust anyone--<br>
not your best friend or even your wife!<br>
6<br>
For the son despises his father.<br>
The daughter defies her mother.<br>
The daughter-in-law defies her mother-in-law.<br>
Your enemies are right in your own household!<br>
7<br>
As for me, I look to the Lord for help.<br>
I wait confidently for God to save me,<br>
and my God will certainly hear me.<br>
8<br>
Do not gloat over me, my enemies!<br>
For though I fall, I will rise again.<br>
Though I sit in darkness,<br>
the Lord will be my light.<br>

Matthew 12: 46-50 (KJV)<br>
46 Whilst he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.<br>
47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.<br>
48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?<br>
49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<br>
50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 12: 46-50 (NLT)<br>
46 As Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him. <br>
47 Someone told Jesus, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and they want to speak to you."<br>
48 Jesus asked, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?" <br>
49 Then he pointed to his disciples and said, "Look, these are my mother and brothers. <br>
50 Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 3: 31-35 (KJV)<br>
31 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.<br>
32 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.<br>
33 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?<br>
34 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<br>
35 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 3: 31-35 (NLT)<br>
31 Then Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him. They stood outside and sent word for him to come out and talk with them. <br>
32 There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and someone said, "Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you."<br>
33 Jesus replied, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?" <br>
34 Then he looked at those around him and said, "Look, these are my mother and brothers. <br>
35 Anyone who does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."<br>

<a name="JAH5RESQFRWICKEVIL"></a><h2>The Rescue from The Wicked and Evil</h2>
<p>
<br>
The Rescue from The Wicked and Evil<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
There was a season when King Saul, possessed with many demons, especially, fear, torment, anger, pride and jealousy towards David, was trying to kill David before he became the next king.  During that time, David was in hiding, knowing that all of King Saul's army was searching for David, in order to kill him.  It was during these stressful times when David wrote several of the Psalms that we now have today. Keep that in mind every time you see a Psalm that begins with the words, A Psalm of David.  I imagine that David was battling spiritual attacks, like rejection, depression, and fear, and he did not have any anti-depressants to help level him off. Imagine what his Psalms would have been like if he was on anti-depressants; Psalms that probably would end up being not as good or as true or as helpful for us today. That would explain why David would write in a Psalm his desire to see his enemies defeated, disabled, and destroyed. That is one perspective that we see in Psalms 109.<br>
<br>
But Jesus also offers a different, alternate perspective in regards to our attitude towards our enemies. David is saying here in Psalms 109 that he wants his enemies disabled or destroyed so they will stop trying to kill him. Here is a different perspective that Jesus teaches.  Let us consider both David's perspective, and Jesus' teachings when it comes to our choices, our prayers, and our actions and attitudes towards our enemies.<br>
<br>
<br>
David is asking the Lord to curse his enemies, but another perspective to consider is...<br>
Romans 12:14 KJV<br>
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 10:20 (KJV)<br>
Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.<br>
<br>
Do you know anyone who is not listening to the Word of God, when you try to tell someone about Jesus and your words seem to fall on deaf ears?<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 12:2 (KJV)<br>
Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 19:14 (KJV)<br>
Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:27 (KJV)<br>
He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5:44<br>
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;<br>
<br>
Luke 6:28<br>
Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:7<br>
When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, one more time, consider this...<br>
Romans 12:14 KJV<br>
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.<br>
NLT:<br>
14 Bless those who persecute you. Don't curse them; pray that God will bless them.<br>
<br>
<br>
and here again is the perspective presented by Jesus Christ:<br>
Matthew 5:44<br>
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;<br>
NLT:<br>
44 But I say, love your enemies! Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you. Pray for those who persecute you!<br>
<br>
Keep that in mind as we read Psalms 109.<br>
I will let you know when we reach verse 6, where David finds it necessary to ask the Lord to curse his enemies, in his particular situation.<br>
If everyone was trying to kill us, even though we had not done anything wrong, I think I would also be considering the idea of asking the Lord to curse my enemies too.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 109<br>
KJV<br>
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.<br>
1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;<br>
2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.<br>
(For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have opened themselves against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.)<br>
3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.<br>
4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.<br>
5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 109<br>
verses 6 through 19<br>
Commentary:<br>
Generally speaking, when the wicked are cursing the Godly, it may sound like this.<br>
These are David's prayers, against the Enemies, the curses for his Enemies -- He is praying to the Lord, Lord, Stop My Enemies from Attacking Me.<br>
<br>
<br>
6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let (an adversary,) Satan stand at his right hand.<br>
7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.<br>
(When he shall be judged, let him be found to be wicked, let him go out guilty: and let his prayer become sin.)<br>
8 Let his days be few; and let another take his office (let another take his charge).<br>
9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.<br>
10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.<br>
11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.<br>
12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.<br>
13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.<br>
14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.<br>
15 Let them be before the Lord continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.<br>
16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.<br>
17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.<br>
18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, (so let it come within him like water,) and like oil into his bones.<br>
19 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 109<br>
Verses 20 through 31<br>
Commentary:<br>
This could also be a way how the Godly respond with a prayer that begins here in verse 20.<br>
David is Praying to The Lord, when he is saying, Rescue Me, Help Me, Save Me O Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
20 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the Lord, and of them that speak evil against my soul.<br>
21 But do thou for me, O God the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.<br>
22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.<br>
23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.<br>
24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.<br>
25 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.<br>
26 Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy:<br>
27 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, Lord, hast done it.<br>
28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.<br>
29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.<br>
30 I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth; yea, I will praise him amongst the multitude.<br>
31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul. <br>
(to save him from the judges of those that condemn his soul.)<br>

Psalms 109<br>
NLT<br>
For the choir director: A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
O God, whom I praise,<br>
don't stand silent and aloof<br>
2<br>
whilst the wicked slander me<br>
and tell lies about me.<br>
3<br>
They surround me with hateful words<br>
and fight against me for no reason.<br>
4<br>
I love them, but they try to destroy me with accusations<br>
even as I am praying for them!<br>
5<br>
They repay evil for good,<br>
and hatred for my love.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 109<br>

Commentary:<br>
Generally speaking, when the wicked are cursing the Godly, it may sound like this.<br>
These are David's prayers, against the Enemies, the curses for his Enemies -- He is praying to the Lord, Lord, Stop My Enemes from Attacking Me.<br>
<br>
<br>
6<br>
They say, "Get an evil person to turn against him.<br>
Send an accuser to bring him to trial.<br>
7<br>
When his case comes up for judgement,<br>
let him be pronounced guilty.<br>
Count his prayers as sins.<br>
8<br>
Let his years be few;<br>
let someone else take his position.<br>
9<br>
May his children become fatherless,<br>
and his wife a widow.<br>
10<br>
May his children wander as beggars<br>
and be driven from their ruined homes.<br>
(May his children wander as beggars and seek their ruined homes.)<br>
11<br>
May creditors seize his entire estate,<br>
and strangers take all he has earned.<br>
12<br>
Let no one be kind to him;<br>
let no one pity his fatherless children.<br>
13<br>
May all his offspring die.<br>
May his family name be blotted out in the next generation.<br>
14<br>
May the Lord never forget the sins of his fathers;<br>
may his mother's sins never be erased from the record.<br>
15<br>
May the Lord always remember these sins,<br>
and may his name disappear from human memory.<br>
16<br>
For he refused all kindness to others;<br>
he persecuted the poor and needy,<br>
and he hounded the brokenhearted to death.<br>
17<br>
He loved to curse others;<br>
now you curse him.<br>
He never blessed others;<br>
now don't you bless him.<br>
18<br>
Cursing is as natural to him as his clothing,<br>
or the water he drinks,<br>
or the rich food he eats.<br>
19<br>
Now may his curses return and cling to him like clothing;<br>
may they be tied around him like a belt."<br>

David is Praying to The Lord, when he is saying, Rescue Me, Help Me, Save Me O Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
20<br>
May those curses become the Lord's punishment<br>
for my accusers who speak evil of me.<br>
21<br>
But deal well with me, O Sovereign Lord,<br>
for the sake of your own reputation!<br>
Rescue me<br>
because you are so faithful and good.<br>
22<br>
For I am poor and needy,<br>
and my heart is full of pain.<br>
23<br>
I am fading like a shadow at dusk;<br>
I am brushed off like a locust.<br>
24<br>
My knees are weak from fasting,<br>
and I am skin and bones.<br>
25<br>
I am a joke to people everywhere;<br>
when they see me, they shake their heads in scorn.<br>
26<br>
Help me, O Lord my God!<br>
Save me because of your unfailing love.<br>
27<br>
Let them see that this is your doing,<br>
that you yourself have done it, Lord.<br>
28<br>
Then let them curse me if they like,<br>
but you will bless me!<br>
When they attack me, they will be disgraced!<br>
But I, your servant, will go right on rejoicing!<br>
29<br>
May my accusers be clothed with disgrace;<br>
may their humiliation cover them like a cloak.<br>
30<br>
But I will give repeated thanks to the Lord,<br>
praising him to everyone.<br>
31<br>
For he stands beside the needy,<br>
ready to save them from those who condemn them.<br>
<br>
<br>

Psalms 140<br>
KJV<br>
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.<br>
1 Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man (preserve me from the man of violences);<br>
2 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.<br>
3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. <br>
Selah.<br>
4 Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.<br>
5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. <br>
Selah.<br>
6 I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O Lord.<br>
7 O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.<br>
8 Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves (let them not be exalted).<br>
Selah.<br>
9 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.<br>
10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.<br>
11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.<br>
(Let not a man of tongue, a wicked man of violence, be established in the earth: let him be hunted to his overthrow.)<br>
12 I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.<br>
13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 140<br>
NLT<br>
For the choir director: A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
O Lord, rescue me from evil people.<br>
Protect me from those who are violent,<br>
2<br>
those who plot evil in their hearts<br>
and stir up trouble all day long.<br>
3<br>
Their tongues sting like a snake;<br>
the venom of a viper drips from their lips.<br>
Interlude<br>
4<br>
O Lord, keep me out of the hands of the wicked.<br>
Protect me from those who are violent,<br>
for they are plotting against me.<br>
5<br>
The proud have set a trap to catch me;<br>
they have stretched out a net;<br>
they have placed traps all along the way.<br>
Interlude<br>
6<br>
I said to the Lord, "You are my God!"<br>
Listen, O Lord, to my cries for mercy!<br>
7<br>
O Sovereign Lord, the strong one who rescued me,<br>
you protected me on the day of battle.<br>
8<br>
Lord, do not let evil people have their way.<br>
Do not let their evil schemes succeed,<br>
or they will become proud.<br>
Interlude<br>
9<br>
Let my enemies be destroyed<br>
by the very evil they have planned for me.<br>
10<br>
Let burning coals fall down on their heads.<br>
Let them be thrown into the fire<br>
or into watery pits from which they can't escape.<br>
11<br>
Don't let liars prosper here in our land.<br>
Cause great disasters to fall on the violent.<br>
12<br>
But I know the Lord will help those they persecute;<br>
he will give justice to the poor.<br>
13<br>
Surely righteous people are praising your name;<br>
the godly will live in your presence.<br>

Psalms 37<br>
KJV<br>
A Psalm of David.<br>
1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.<br>
2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.<br>
3 Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.<br>
(Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and in truth, and in stableness, thou shalt be fed.<br>
4 Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.<br>
5 (Roll thy way upon the Lord,) Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.<br>
6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgement as the noonday.<br>
7 (Be silent to the Lord,) rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.<br>
8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.<br>
9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth.<br>
10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.<br>
11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br>
12 (The wicked practiseth against the just,) the wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.<br>
13 The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.<br>
14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, (and to slay the upright of way) and to slay such as be of upright conversation.<br>
15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.<br>
16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.<br>
17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the Lord upholdeth the righteous.<br>
18 The Lord knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.<br>
19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.<br>
(But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the preciousness of lambs.)<br>
20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.<br>
21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.<br>
22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.<br>
(The steps of a good man are established by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.)<br>
23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.<br>
24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.<br>
25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.<br>
26 (He is all the day merciful,) he is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.<br>
27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.<br>
28 For the Lord loveth judgement, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.<br>
30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgement.<br>
31 The law of his God is in his heart; (none of his goings shall slide,) none of his steps shall slide.<br>
32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.<br>
33 The Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.<br>
34 Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.<br>
35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree, (and spreading himself like a green tree that groweth in his own soil).<br>
36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.<br>
37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.<br>
38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord: he is their strength in the time of trouble.<br>
40 And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37<br>
NLT<br>
This psalm is a Hebrew acrostic poem; each stanza begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
Don't worry about the wicked<br>
or envy those who do wrong.<br>
2<br>
For like grass, they soon fade away.<br>
Like spring flowers, they soon wither.<br>
3<br>
Trust in the Lord and do good.<br>
Then you will live safely in the land and prosper.<br>
4<br>
Take delight in the Lord,<br>
and he will give you your heart's desires.<br>
5<br>
Commit everything you do to the Lord.<br>
Trust him, and he will help you.<br>
6<br>
He will make your innocence radiate like the dawn,<br>
and the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun.<br>
7<br>
Be still in the presence of the Lord,<br>
and wait patiently for him to act.<br>
Don't worry about evil people who prosper<br>
or fret about their wicked schemes.<br>
8<br>
Stop being angry!<br>
Turn from your rage!<br>
Do not lose your temper--<br>
it only leads to harm.<br>
9<br>
For the wicked will be destroyed,<br>
but those who trust in the Lord will possess the land.<br>
10<br>
Soon the wicked will disappear.<br>
Though you look for them, they will be gone.<br>
11<br>
The lowly will possess the land<br>
and will live in peace and prosperity.<br>
12<br>
The wicked plot against the godly;<br>
they snarl at them in defiance.<br>
13<br>
But the Lord just laughs,<br>
for he sees their day of judgement coming.<br>
14<br>
The wicked draw their swords<br>
and string their bows<br>
to kill the poor and the oppressed,<br>
to slaughter those who do right.<br>
15<br>
But their swords will stab their own hearts,<br>
and their bows will be broken.<br>
16<br>
It is better to be godly and have little<br>
than to be evil and rich.<br>
17<br>
For the strength of the wicked will be shattered,<br>
but the Lord takes care of the godly.<br>
18<br>
Day by day the Lord takes care of the innocent,<br>
and they will receive an inheritance that lasts forever.<br>
19<br>
They will not be disgraced in hard times;<br>
even in famine they will have more than enough.<br>
20<br>
But the wicked will die.<br>
The Lord's enemies are like flowers in a field--<br>
they will disappear like smoke.<br>
21<br>
The wicked borrow and never repay,<br>
but the godly are generous givers.<br>
22<br>
Those the Lord blesses will possess the land,<br>
but those he curses will die.<br>
23<br>
The Lord directs the steps of the godly.<br>
He delights in every detail of their lives.<br>
24<br>
Though they stumble, they will never fall,<br>
for the Lord holds them by the hand.<br>
25<br>
Once I was young, and now I am old.<br>
Yet I have never seen the godly abandoned<br>
or their children begging for bread.<br>
26<br>
The godly always give generous loans to others,<br>
and their children are a blessing.<br>
27<br>
Turn from evil and do good,<br>
and you will live in the land forever.<br>
28<br>
For the Lord loves justice,<br>
and he will never abandon the godly.<br>
He will keep them safe forever,<br>
but the children of the wicked will die.<br>
29<br>
The godly will possess the land<br>
and will live there forever.<br>
30<br>
The godly offer good counsel;<br>
they teach right from wrong.<br>
31<br>
They have made God's law their own,<br>
so they will never slip from his path.<br>
32<br>
The wicked wait in ambush for the godly,<br>
looking for an excuse to kill them.<br>
33<br>
But the Lord will not let the wicked succeed<br>
or let the godly be condemned when they are put on trial.<br>
34<br>
Put your hope in the Lord.<br>
Travel steadily along his path.<br>
He will honour you by giving you the land.<br>
You will see the wicked destroyed.<br>
35<br>
I have seen wicked and ruthless people<br>
flourishing like a tree in its native soil.<br>
36<br>
But when I looked again, they were gone!<br>
Though I searched for them, I could not find them!<br>
37<br>
Look at those who are honest and good,<br>
for a wonderful future awaits those who love peace.<br>
38<br>
But the rebellious will be destroyed;<br>
they have no future.<br>
39<br>
The Lord rescues the godly;<br>
he is their fortress in times of trouble.<br>
40<br>
The Lord helps them,<br>
rescuing them from the wicked.<br>
He saves them,<br>
and they find shelter in him.<br>
<br>
<br>

Above every fear I rise<br>
Eyes fixed on You<br>
And You'll never leave my side<br>

You carry me through<br>
Oh You are the One I choose<br>
