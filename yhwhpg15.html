<a name="JAH15SAVRISBORN"></a><h2>Birth of Jesus</h2>
<p>
<br>
The Sign of Immanuel is a prophecy in Isaiah 7.<br>
The book of Isaiah was written about 600 to 700 years before Jesus Christ was born.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 7:14 (KJV)<br>
Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, (a young woman,) a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel (which means 'God is with us').<br>
<br>
There is also a little mention of this in Isaiah 8, verses 8 and 10.<br>
And we also have this Hope in the Messiah, found right here...<br>
Isaiah 9:6 (KJV)<br>
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 9: 6 & 7 (NLT)<br>
6<br>
For a child is born to us,<br>
a son is given to us.<br>
The government will rest on his shoulders.<br>
And he will be called:<br>
Wonderful Counsellor, (he will be called Wonderful, he will be called Counsellor,) Mighty God,<br>
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.<br>
7<br>
His government and its peace<br>
will never end.<br>
(He will establish it with judgement,)<br>
He will rule with fairness and justice from the throne of his ancestor David<br>
for all eternity.<br>
(The zeal of the Lord of hosts,) The passionate commitment of the Lord of Heaven's Armies<br>
will make this happen!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Birth of Jesus the Messiah is told in Matthew 1.<br>
Matthew 1:23 (KJV) -- This verse is quoting from the Greek Version of Isaiah 7:14, which we had just read a moment ago...<br>
Matthew 1:23 (KJV)<br>
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 1<br>
The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold<br>
The Birth of Jesus Foretold<br>
<br>
Luke 1: 30-35 NLT<br>
30 "Don't be afraid, Mary," the angel (Gabriel) told her, "for you have found favour with God!<br>
31 You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.<br>
32 He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David.<br>
33 And (he will reign over the house of Jacob,) he will reign over Israel forever; his Kingdom will never end!"<br>
34 Mary asked the angel, "But how can this happen? I am a virgin."<br>
35 The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the baby to be born will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God.<br>
<br>
and then, as we get near the end of chapter 1, we have<br>
The Birth of John the Baptist<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 2: 1-21 -- KJV<br>
1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.<br>
2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)<br>
3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.<br>
4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)<br>
5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.<br>
6 And so it was, that, whilst they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.<br>
7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.<br>
8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.<br>
9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.<br>
10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.<br>
11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.<br>
12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.<br>
13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,<br>
14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.<br>
15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.<br>
16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.<br>
17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.<br>
18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.<br>
19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.<br>
20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.<br>
21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 2: 1-21 -- NLT<br>
1 At that time the Roman emperor, Augustus, decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire.<br>
2 (This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.)<br>
3 All returned to their own ancestral towns to register for this census.<br>
4 And because Joseph was a descendant of King David, he had to go to Bethlehem in Judea, David's ancient home. He travelled there from the village of Nazareth in Galilee.<br>
5 He took with him Mary, to whom he was engaged, who was now expecting a child.<br>
6 And whilst they were there, the time came for her baby to be born.<br>
7 She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them.<br>
8 That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep.<br>
9 Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them, and the radiance of the Lord's glory surrounded them. They were terrified,<br>
10 but the angel reassured them. "Don't be afraid!" he said. "I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people.<br>
11 The Saviour -- yes, the Messiah, the Lord -- has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David!<br>
12 And you will recognise him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger."<br>
13 Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others -- the armies of heaven -- praising God and saying,<br>
14<br>
"Glory to God in highest heaven,<br>
and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased."<br>
15 When the angels had returned to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, "Let's go to Bethlehem! Let's see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."<br>
16 They hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger.<br>
17 After seeing him, the shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child.<br>
18 All who heard the shepherds' story were astonished,<br>
19 but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often.<br>
20 The shepherds went back to their flocks, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen. It was just as the angel had told them.<br>
21 Eight days later, when the baby was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel even before he was conceived.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also in Luke 2,<br>
Jesus Is Presented in the Temple<br>
(If a woman's first child is a boy, he must be dedicated to the Lord. -- according to Exodus 13:2.)<br>
<br>
The Prophecy of Simeon<br>
The Prophecy of Anna<br>
<br>
And so, for now, we conclude the story of the Birth of Jesus with this final word...<br>
<br>
Luke 2: 39 & 40 -- KJV<br>
39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.<br>
40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 2: 39 & 40 -- NLT<br>
39 When Jesus' parents had fulfilled all the requirements of the law of the Lord, they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee.<br>
40 There the child grew up healthy and strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God's favour was on him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a short edit of an additional scene that is included in the book of Matthew 2.<br>
This happened right after Jesus was born. This is a quick look at the wise Visitors from the East, known as the Magi.<br>
We are just going to read a few selected verses about it in the NLT only.<br>
<br>
By the way, the Magi are known to be Magian, originally Median, who seem to have conformed to the Persian religion, whilst retaining some of their old beliefs.<br>
They are thought to be Oriental scientists, magicians or wizards.<br>
These Oriental wise men could have been teachers, priests, physicians, astrologers, seers, interpreters of dreams, augers, soothsayers or sorcerers.<br>
The Bible does not tell us how many of them there were.<br>
Some people think that there were three wise men, but the Bible does not tell us how many of them were actually there.<br>
<br>
Matthew 2:1 -- NLT<br>
About that time (some royal astrologers, some magi,) some wise men from eastern lands arrived in Jerusalem, asking,<br>
2<br>
"Where is the new-born king of the Jews? (We saw his star in the east) We saw his star as it rose in the east and we have come to worship him."<br>
<br>
Matthew 2:6 -- NLT<br>
...this is what the prophet wrote:<br>
6<br>
'And you, O Bethlehem in the land of Judah,<br>
(are not least among the rulers of Judah,)<br>
are not least among the ruling cities of Judah,<br>
for a ruler will come from you<br>
who will be the shepherd for my people Israel.'<br>
<br>
they are referring to<br>
Micah 5:2<br>
and 2 Samuel 5:2.<br>
<br>
Matthew 2: 9-11 NLT<br>
...the wise men went their way. And the star they had seen in the east guided them to Bethlehem. It went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was.<br>
10 When they saw the star, they were filled with joy!<br>
11 They entered the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.<br>

The next song is technically a Christmas carol.<br>
Yet, it is interesting to read this at any time throughout the year,<br>
because it reminds us of who the Saviour is, and it does have some interesting lyrics<br>
that praise Him, and remind us of the work that He did for us so that we can be forgiven and saved<br>
with His free gift of Eternal Life.<br>
<br>
<br>
O Holy Night (O Night Divine) is a well-known Christmas carol composed by Adolphe Adam in 1847 to the French poem which would be titled, in English, as, Midnight, Christians, was written by wine merchant and poet Placide Cappeau (1808–1877).<br>
<br>
The poem and song came from the city of<br>
-- In French, it is pronounced, Rook Moo-ur --<br>
Roquemaure, in southern France.<br>
<br>
The song was premiered in the city of Roquemaure in 1847.<br>
Unitarian minister John Sullivan Dwight,<br>
editor of Dwight's Journal of Music,<br>
translated the song into English lyrics in 1855.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the Literal English translation<br>
of Placide Cappeau's 1847 French Christmas poem<br>
Which, in English, would be titled, O Holy Night...<br>
<br>
Midnight, Christians, is the solemn hour,<br>
When God as man descended unto us<br>
To erase the stain of original sin<br>
And to end the wrath of His Father.<br>
The entire world thrills with hope<br>
On this night that gives it a Saviour.<br>
<br>
People, kneel down, await your deliverance.<br>
Christmas, Christmas, here is the Redeemer,<br>
Christmas, Christmas, here is the Redeemer!<br>
<br>
May the ardent light of our Faith<br>
Guide us all to the cradle of the infant,<br>
As in ancient times a brilliant star<br>
Guided the Oriental kings there.<br>
The King of Kings was born in a humble manger;<br>
O mighty ones of today, proud of your greatness,<br>
<br>
It is to your pride that God preaches.<br>
Bow your heads before the Redeemer!<br>
Bow your heads before the Redeemer!<br>
<br>
The Redeemer has broken every bond<br>
The Earth is free, and Heaven is open.<br>
He sees a brother where there was only a slave,<br>
Love unites those whom iron had chained.<br>
Who will tell Him of our gratitude,<br>
For all of us He is born, He suffers and dies.<br>
<br>
People, stand up! Sing of your deliverance,<br>
Christmas, Christmas, sing of the Redeemer,<br>
Christmas, Christmas, sing of the Redeemer!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the lyrics to John Sullivan Dwight's 1855 English song version of O Holy Night.<br>
<br>
<br>
O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,<br>
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth.<br>
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,<br>
Till He appear'd and the soul felt its worth.<br>
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,<br>
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fall on your knees! O hear the angel voices!<br>
O night divine, O night when Christ was born;<br>
O night divine, O night, O night Divine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming,<br>
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.<br>
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,<br>
Here come the wise men from the Orient land.<br>
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;<br>
In all our trials born to be our friend.<br>
<br>
<br>
He knows our need, to our weaknesses no stranger,<br>
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!<br>
Behold your King, Before Him lowly bend!<br>
<br>
<br>
Truly He taught us to love one another;<br>
His law is love and His gospel is peace.<br>
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;<br>
And in His name all oppression shall cease.<br>
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,<br>
Let all within us praise His holy name.<br>
<br>
<br>
Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever,<br>
His power and glory evermore proclaim.<br>
His power and glory evermore proclaim.<br>
<br>
O night divine, O night, O night Divine.<br>
<br>

<br>
There is an interesting quote spoken by Zorii Bliss in the 2019 film,<br>
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.<br>
Zorii Bliss is a character, played in the film by Keri Russell.<br>
<br>
Despite holding a grudge against Poe for abandoning her spice runner group, she helps him, along with Rey, Finn, C-3PO, BB-8, and D-O. She hides them from the First Order when they come to Kijimi to decrypt a message inside C-3PO's memory.<br>
What we are about to quote is found about 52 minutes into the film.<br>
Whilst talking to Poe, she says the following words to him:<br>
<br>
They win, by making you think you're alone.<br>
Remember?<br>
There's more of us.<br>
<br>
<br>
That reminds me of a few Bible verses!<br>
<br>
2 Kings 6: 15-17 KJV<br>
15 And when (the minister,) the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?<br>
16 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.<br>
17 And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 6: 15-17 NLT<br>
15 When the servant of the man of God got up early the next morning and went outside, there were troops, horses, and chariots everywhere. "Oh, sir, what will we do now?" the young man cried to Elisha.<br>
16 "Don't be afraid!" Elisha told him. "For there are more on our side than on theirs!"<br>
17 Then Elisha prayed, "O Lord, open his eyes and let him see!" The Lord opened the young man's eyes, and when he looked up, he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and chariots of fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

18 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>

<p>
<br>
Psalms 37: 16-24 (KJV)<br>
16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.<br>
17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the Lord upholdeth the righteous.<br>
18 The Lord knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.<br>
19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.<br>
<br>
(But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the preciousness of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.)<br>
<br>
20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.<br>
<br>
21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.<br>
22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.<br>
<br>
(The steps of a good man are established by the Lord.)<br>
23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.<br>
24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37: 16-24 (NLT)<br>
16<br>
It is better to be godly and have little<br>
than to be evil and rich.<br>
17<br>
For the strength of the wicked will be shattered,<br>
but the Lord takes care of the godly.<br>
18<br>
Day by day the Lord takes care of the innocent,<br>
and they will receive an inheritance that lasts forever.<br>
19<br>
They will not be disgraced in hard times;<br>
even in famine they will have more than enough.<br>
20<br>
But the wicked will die.<br>
The Lord's enemies are like flowers in a field --<br>
they will disappear like smoke.<br>
21<br>
The wicked borrow and never repay,<br>
but the godly are generous givers.<br>
22<br>
Those the Lord blesses will possess the land,<br>
but those he curses will die.<br>
23<br>
The Lord directs the steps of the godly.<br>
He delights in every detail of their lives.<br>
24<br>
Though they stumble, they will never fall,<br>
for the Lord holds them by the hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 26:3 (KJV)<br>
Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 26: 3 & 4 NLT<br>
3<br>
You will keep in perfect peace<br>
all who trust in you,<br>
all whose thoughts are fixed on you!<br>
4<br>
Trust in the Lord always,<br>
for the Lord God is the eternal Rock.<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4: 6 & 7 (KJV)<br>
6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<br>
7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4: 6 & 7 (NIV)<br>
6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.<br>
7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4: 6 & 7 (NLT)<br>
(Remember, the Lord is near.)<br>
Remember, the Lord is coming soon.<br>
6 Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done.<br>
7 Then you will experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.<br>

<br>
The Book of Matthew, from chapter 6, verse 24, to chapter 7, verse 12 (KJV)<br>
24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<br>
25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?<br>
26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?<br>
27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?<br>
28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<br>
29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.<br>
30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?<br>
31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<br>
32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<br>
33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.<br>
34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.<br>
1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.<br>
2 For with what judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.<br>
3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?<br>
4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?<br>
5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.<br>
6 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.<br>
7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:<br>
8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<br>
9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?<br>
10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?<br>
11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?<br>
12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of Matthew, from chapter 6, verse 24, to chapter 7, verse 12 (NLT)<br>
24 "No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money.<br>
25 "That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life -- whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn't life more than food, and your body more than clothing?<br>
26 Look at the birds. They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren't you far more valuable to him than they are?<br>
27 Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?<br>
28 "And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don't work or make their clothing,<br>
29 yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.<br>
30 And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?<br>
31 "So don't worry about these things, saying, 'What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?'<br>
32 These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs.<br>
<br>
(Seek the Kingdom above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.)<br>
33 Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.<br>
<br>
34 "So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today's trouble is enough for today.<br>
1 "Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 For you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged.<br>
(For God will judge you as you judge others. The measure you give will be the measure you get back.)<br>
<br>
(And why worry about a speck in your brother's eye when you have a log in your own?)<br>
3 "And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? <br>
<br>
<br>
4 How can you think of saying to (your brother, or) your friend, 'Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye?<br>
<br>
<br>
5 Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.<br>
<br>
(Don't give the sacred to dogs.)<br>
6 "Don't waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Don't throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.<br>
7 "Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.<br>
8 For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.<br>
9 "You parents -- if your children ask for a loaf of bread, do you give them a stone instead?<br>
10 Or if they ask for a fish, do you give them a snake? Of course not!<br>
11 So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.<br>
12 "Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 13-38 KJV<br>
13 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.<br>
14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?<br>
15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.<br>
16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:<br>
17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?<br>
18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.<br>
19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.<br>
20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?<br>
21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.<br>
22 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.<br>
23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.<br>
24 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?<br>
25 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?<br>
26 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?<br>
27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.<br>
28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?<br>
29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.<br>
30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.<br>
31 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.<br>
32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.<br>
33 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.<br>
34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<br>
35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;<br>
36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.<br>
37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.<br>
38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 13-38 NLT<br>
<br>
13 Then someone called from the crowd, "Teacher, please tell my brother to divide our father's estate with me."<br>
14 Jesus replied, "Friend, who made me a judge over you to decide such things as that?"<br>
15 Then he said, "Beware! Guard against every kind of greed. Life is not measured by how much you own."<br>
16 Then he told them a story: "A rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops.<br>
17 He said to himself, 'What should I do? I don't have room for all my crops.'<br>
18 Then he said, 'I know! I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones. Then I'll have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods.<br>
19 And I'll sit back and say to myself, "My friend, you have enough stored away for years to come. Now take it easy! Eat, drink, and be merry!"'<br>
20 "But God said to him, 'You fool! You will die this very night. Then who will get everything you worked for?'<br>
21 "Yes, a person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God."<br>
22 Then, turning to his disciples, Jesus said, "That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life -- whether you have enough food to eat or enough clothes to wear.<br>
23 For life is more than food, and your body more than clothing.<br>
24 Look at the ravens. They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for God feeds them. And you are far more valuable to him than any birds!<br>
25 Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?<br>
26 And if worry can't accomplish a little thing like that, what's the use of worrying over bigger things?<br>
27 "Look at the lilies and how they grow. They don't work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.<br>
28 And if God cares so wonderfully for flowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?<br>
29 "And don't be concerned about what to eat and what to drink. Don't worry about such things.<br>
30 These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers all over the world, but your Father already knows your needs.<br>
31 Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and he will give you everything you need.<br>
32 "So don't be afraid, little flock. For it gives your Father great happiness to give you the Kingdom.<br>
33 "Sell your possessions and give to those in need. This will store up treasure for you in heaven! And the purses of heaven never get old or develop holes. Your treasure will be safe; no thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it.<br>
34 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.<br>
35 "Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning,<br>
36 as though you were waiting for your master to return from the wedding feast. Then you will be ready to open the door and let him in the moment he arrives and knocks.<br>
37 The servants who are ready and waiting for his return will be rewarded. I tell you the truth, he himself will seat them, put on an apron, and serve them as they sit and eat!<br>
38 (He may come in the second or third watch.) He may come in the middle of the night or just before dawn. But whenever he comes, he will reward the servants who are ready.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 7:21 (KJV)<br>
Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 7:21 (NLT)<br>
Are you a slave? Don't let that worry you -- but if you get a chance to be free, take it.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Luke 21: 31-38 KJV (verse 38 is at the end of chapter 21)<br>
31 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.<br>
32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.<br>
33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.<br>
34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.<br>
35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.<br>
36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.<br>
37 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.<br>
38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 21: 31-38 NLT (reading from verse 31 to the end of chapter 21)<br>
31 In the same way, when you see all these things taking place, you can know that the Kingdom of God is near.<br>
32 I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things have taken place.<br>
33 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.<br>
34 "Watch out! Don't let your hearts be dulled by carousing and drunkenness, and by the worries of this life. Don't let that day catch you unaware,<br>
35 like a trap. For that day will come upon everyone living on the earth.<br>
36 Keep alert at all times. And pray that you might be strong enough to escape these coming horrors and stand before the Son of Man."<br>
37 Every day Jesus went to the Temple to teach, and each evening he returned to spend the night on the Mount of Olives.<br>
38 The crowds gathered at the Temple early each morning to hear him.<br>

<br>
Psalms 55: 22 & 23 KJV<br>
22 Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.<br>
23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.<br>
(Men of bloods and deceit shall not half their days; but I will trust in thee.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 55: 22 & 23 (NLT)<br>
22<br>
Give your burdens to the Lord,<br>
and he will take care of you.<br>
He will not permit the godly to slip and fall.<br>
23<br>
But you, O God, will send the wicked<br>
down to the pit of destruction.<br>
Murderers and liars will die young,<br>
but I am trusting you to save me.<br>

<br>
1 Peter 5: 5-11 KJV<br>
Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.<br>
6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:<br>
7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.<br>
8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br>
9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<br>
10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.<br>
11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: 5-11 (NLT)<br>
...And all of you, dress yourselves in humility as you relate to one another, for<br>
"God opposes the proud<br>
but gives grace to the humble." (That is a quote from the Greek version of Proverbs 3:34.)<br>
6 So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honour.<br>
7 Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.<br>
8 Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.<br>
9 Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that (your brotherhood,) your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.<br>
10 In his kindness God called you to share in his eternal glory by means of Christ Jesus. So after you have suffered a little while, he will restore, support, and strengthen you, and he will place you on a firm foundation.<br>
11 All power to him forever! Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4: 19 & 20 KJV<br>
19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.<br>
20 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4: 19 & 20 (NLT)<br>
19 And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.<br>
20 Now all glory to God our Father forever and ever! Amen.<br>
<br>

John 16: End of verse 32 and verse 33 (KJV)<br>
...I am not alone, because the Father is with me.<br>
33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 16: End of verse 32 and verse 33 (NLT)<br>
...I am not alone because the Father is with me.<br>
33 I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I have overcome the world."

Amen.<br>
<br>
Amen means, so be it, let it become true.<br>
Some people say it like this, Ay-Men.<br>
And some say, Ah-men.<br>
There actually are some other fake gods out there that have a name that sounds very similar to Ay-Men and Ah-Men.<br>
Therefore, if you want to say amen in the Hebrew language, in the exact way how it should be pronounced, then it sounds like this...<br>
Aw-mane, or Ah-Main.<br>
it means<br>
verily, truly, so be it<br>
sure, faithfulness, truth.<br>
<br>
with that in mind, we could say that Aw-Mane means,<br>
so be it, may it come true, may it be for sure.<br>
<br>
Of course, only if it is the Heavenly Father's will.<br>
May His will be done, may His always good, pleasing and perfect will<br>
override and supersede what we pray.<br>

The next news article that I would like to share with you came from this website...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://premierchristian.news/">https://premierchristian.news/</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Premier Christian Communications is a Christian communications organisation owned by the charity Premier Christian Media Trust.<br>
They publish a few Christian magazines, and they broadcast a few different Premier Christian Radio networks.<br>
Their Christian radio programming includes news, debate, teachings and Christian music, broadcasting across the United Kingdom, and is also available worldwide on the Internet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Premier Christian News published an article On Thursday 16 January 2020.<br>
Here are some selected quoted parts from that article, written by Tola Mbakwe.<br>
<br>
Reverend Jonathan Greaves tell us this story.<br>
He is at Monmouth Baptist Church<br>
in Monmouth, Wales.<br>
The city of Monmouth is about 131 miles west of London, when measured from the centre of London.<br>
<br>
Reverend Jonathan Greaves tells us that, in October 2019, the parents of a seven-year-old son gave their son a new book, "and the first thing he wanted to write in it was something about his faith and praise to God."<br>
The parents showed the book to Mr Greaves.<br>
This is what the seven-year-old boy wrote in the book:<br>
"I love Jesus and God because they look after me and are nice to me. They love me very much and they make me better and they're the best adults in the whole wide world.<br>
"I love them very, very much. They're so nice to me. I will always believe in them. They like me so much. They are so, so, so, so, so kind to me and I trust them.<br>
"They give me strength. He loves me all the time. I praise the Lord, I can trust in him. They are the best. I am so excited to go to heaven. I'll never hurt myself and I'll never get a stitch. And he died on the cross for me. He saved my life."<br>
<br>
About three months later, after writing that down, the boy, Samuel Barker, from Monmouth, Wales, was killed in a mini bus accident on Monday 13 January 2020.<br>
He was out walking and was hit by the minibus, driven by a 45-year-old man from Gloucester.  The driver was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving.<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to meeting that boy, Samuel Barker, someday, when I get to heaven. Will you come with me?<br>

<a name="JAH157EVENFEATS"></a><h2>Seven Feasts</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the Seven Feasts again.<br>
We will talk about them a little bit more at this time.<br>
<br>
For an additional, more detailed look at some of the Seven Feasts, how to calculate them, and the Bible verses that tell us more on how to calculate the days of the Seven Feasts,<br>
we will look at some additional Feast information in another Bible study, titled, Seven Feast Dates and Calculations, which will be in Christian Essays 22, also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 22.<br>
Actual calendar dates on when to do the Seven Feasts will be listed in that study.<br>
<br>
Here is the list of the feasts, in Leviticus 23.<br>
The information below will help you point to the exact dates on today's calendar.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: As we have mentioned before, when we were studying the Passover in Christian Essays 9, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 9,<br>
there is no completely agreed-upon method as to determine exactly when to do the feast dates.<br>
The heart of the matter is, pray for wisdom about when to do it, make a decision on the date, and guard and keep that date,<br>
then try your best to observe, celebrate and appreciate the value and meaning of the feast or festival, based on the resources that you have available to you.<br>
These resources include, biblical, scriptural, geographical and financial resources that you have available for you, where you are.<br>
As an example for today, we have easy access to the Holy Bible,<br>
and we can easily go on the internet to get a list of the Holidays in Israel, from the Israel calendar.<br>
If you have access to better resources that point to what could be more precise Seven Feast dates, and you are led to use those dates instead, please do.<br>
It is OK to choose dates are just easily available examples using resources that most people can easily and freely access in most geographical areas.<br>

Feast 1 of 7.<br>
Passover -- Pesach<br>
Leviticus 23, verse 5<br>
late March, April, or early May.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p><hr><p>
<br>
Feast 2 of 7.<br>
The Festival of Unleavened Bread<br>
Leviticus 23, verse 6-8<br>
Passover is a meal, and Feast 2 of 7, Unleavened bread, are seven days that start at the Passover meal.<br>
<br>
Feast 1 and Feast 2 always start on the same day at sunset. Since Feast 2 is a sabbath, the next day is a sabbath.<br>
Feast 1 is the meal at sunset, and Feast 2 is a sabbath day that starts at the same time as Feast 1, and carries on into the next day until sunset.<br>
Feast 2 Day 1 is a sabbath.<br>
<br>
<br>
This festival to the Lord continues for seven days, and during that time the bread you eat must be made without yeast.<br>
Eat only the pure unleavened bread during the week following Passover.<br>
The Festival of Unleavened Bread -- start of Day 1, Sabbath, a day of complete rest. Do Not Work on this day.<br>
Festival of Unleavened Bread Day 1 AND Day 7 -- Sabbath, a day of complete rest. Do Not Work on Day 1 and on Day 7.<br>
<br>
In case your calendar should say, Passover (Day 7)<br>
that is actually, Festival of Unleavened Bread, Day 7<br>
<br>
<br>
Festival of Unleavened Bread, Day 7 -- Sabbath, a day of complete rest. Do Not Work on this day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p><hr><p>
<br>
<br>
Feast 3 of 7.<br>
Celebration of First Harvest -- First Fruits<br>
First Fruits -- Yom Rishon -- Yom habikkurim -- Reshit Katzir<br>
Leviticus 23, verse 9-14<br>
To calculate this date for Feast 3 of 7, we start with the day of Passover, also known on some calendars as First day of Passover (Day 1).<br>
Starting with the day after Passover Day 1, the next day, you wait until the day after the next Sabbath Saturday, which will land on a Sunday.<br>
That next Sunday is Feast 3 of 7.  The Sunday feast actually starts at sunset on the previous Saturday night.<br>
To summarise this again,<br>
1. You start with the day after a Passover.<br>
2. You wait until after the next Saturday comes and goes.<br>
3. On that next Saturday, at sunset, is the start of Feast 3 of 7, that continues on into that Sunday, ending on that Sunday sunset.<br>
<br>
By the way, around this time of the year is usually Orthodox Easter, the Babylonian feast of Orthodox Easter.<br>
Easter is named after the Babylonian goddess, Ishtar, the goddess of fertility.<br>
Ishtar, also known as Easter, is not Christian and is not in the Bible.<br>
Leviticus 23, verse 10 & 11:<br>
Bring the priest a bundle of grain from the first cutting of your grain harvest.<br>
We celebrate the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, Yeh-Shoe-Wuh, Yaw-Who-Shaw, as First Fruit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast 3 of 7 is NOT a Sabbath.<br>
We will talk about this is greater detail when we eventually do the Bible study, titled, Seven Feast Dates and Calculations, which will be in Christian Essays 22, also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 22.<br>

Feast 4 of 7.<br>
The Festival of Harvest, Festival of Weeks, Festival of Pentecost<br>
Feast 4 of 7 is Shavuot (or Shabuoth)<br>
Sabbath, a day of complete rest. Do Not Work on this day.<br>
An official day for holy assembly.<br>
Leviticus 23: verses 15-22<br>
<br>
The Festival of Harvest<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23: verses 15-22<br>
NLT<br>
15 "From the day after the Sabbath -- the day you bring the bundle<br>
of grain to be lifted up as a special offering -- count off<br>
seven full weeks.<br>
16 Keep counting until the day after<br>
the seventh Sabbath, fifty days later.<br>
Then present an offering of new grain to the Lord.<br>
17 From wherever you live, bring two loaves of bread to<br>
be lifted up before the Lord as a special offering.<br>
Make these loaves from four quarts of choice flour,<br>
and bake them with yeast. They will be an offering<br>
to the Lord from the first of your crops.<br>
18 Along with the bread, present seven one-year-old<br>
male lambs with no defects, one young bull,<br>
and two rams as burnt offerings to the Lord.<br>
These burnt offerings, together with the grain offerings<br>
and liquid offerings, will be a special gift,<br>
a pleasing aroma to the Lord.<br>
19 Then you must offer one male goat as a sin offering<br>
and two one-year-old male lambs as a peace offering.<br>
20 "The priest will lift up the two lambs as a<br>
special offering to the Lord, together with the<br>
loaves representing the first of your crops.<br>
These offerings, which are holy to the Lord,<br>
belong to the priests.<br>
21 That same day will<br>
be proclaimed an official day for holy assembly,<br>
a day on which you do no ordinary work.<br>
This is a permanent law for you, and it must be<br>
observed from generation to generation wherever you live.<br>
22 "When you harvest the crops of your land,<br>
do not harvest the grain along the edges of<br>
your fields, and do not pick up what the<br>
harvesters drop. Leave it for the poor and<br>
the foreigners living amongst you. I am the Lord your God."<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 23: verses 15-22<br>
TS2009<br>
15 'And from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day<br>
that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering,<br>
you shall count for yourselves: seven completed Sabbaths.<br>
16 'Until the morrow after the seventh Sabbath you<br>
count fifty days, then you shall bring a new grain<br>
offering to Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
17 'Bring from your dwellings for a wave offering<br>
two loaves of bread, of two-tenths of an ephah<br>
of fine flour they are, baked with leaven,<br>
first-fruits to Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
18 'And besides the bread, you shall bring seven<br>
lambs a year old, perfect ones, and one young bull<br>
and two rams. They are an ascending offering to Yaw-Who-Wah,<br>
with their grain offering and their drink offerings,<br>
an offering made by fire for a sweet fragrance to Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
19 'And you shall offer one male goat as a sin offering,<br>
and two male lambs a year old, as a slaughter of peace offerings.<br>
20 'And the priest shall wave them, besides the bread<br>
of the first-fruits, as a wave offering before<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, besides the two lambs. They are set-apart<br>
to Yaw-Who-Wah for the priest.<br>
21 'And on this same day you shall proclaim a<br>
set-apart gathering for yourselves, you do no<br>
servile work on it – a law forever in all your<br>
dwellings throughout your generations.<br>
22 'And when you reap the harvest of your land do not<br>
completely reap the corners of your field when you reap,<br>
and do not gather any gleaning from your harvest.<br>
Leave them for the poor and for the stranger.<br>
I am Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim.' "<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some people confuse Numbers 28:26 to be talking about<br>
Feast 3, but it has a phrase in there that points<br>
to this Feast 4.<br>
Feast 4 of 7 is the day after the seventh Sabbath,<br>
fifty days later.<br>
Exactly 50 days after First Fruits (usually late May or early June).<br>
It is used to mark the start of the summer harvest.<br>
This celebration,<br>
called the Festival of Harvest or the<br>
Festival of Weeks, was later called<br>
the Festival of Pentecost (see Acts 2:1).<br>
Feast 4 of 7 is celebrated today as Shavuot (or Shabuoth).<br>
Feast 4 of 7 is a<br>
Sabbath, a day of complete rest. Do Not Work on this day.<br>

This Jewish new year is not the same as the Biblical New Years' Day, which is 13 days before Passover, determined by, some might say, when we first see new, green ears visible on barley, followed by the first visibly-detected sliver of light on the first New Moon that is seen after the first official day of the spring equinox, according to various scriptures and the operation of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar.<br>
There can be some discussion, some debate, and even some arguments that are for and against the various calculation methods.<br>
We will talk about how to calculate the Jewish new year and the Passover in greater detail when we eventually do the Bible study, titled, Seven Feast Dates and Calculations, which will be in Christian Essays 22, also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 22.<br>

Feast 5 of 7, The Festival of Trumpets, is a day commemorated with loud blasts of a trumpet.<br>
<br>
Sabbath, a day of complete rest. Do Not Work on this day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p><hr><p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Feast 6 of 7.<br>
The Day of Atonement<br>
verse 26-32<br>
nine days after the Festival of Trumpets.<br>
September or October.<br>
Yom Kippur.<br>
deny yourselves (it technically means, to humble yourselves, traditionally interpreted as a day to fast)<br>
The Hebrew word used in here does not exactly say, to fast, but that is traditionally a good way of how one can humble one's self on this day.<br>
Commentary: Why is it called a feast if you traditionally do not eat anything on this day?<br>
Technically, the exact Hebrew wording used for this day does not say anything about fasting.<br>
<br>
Sabbath, a day of complete rest. Do Not Work on this day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p><hr><p>
<br>
<br>
Feast 7 of 7.<br>
The Festival of Shelters<br>
Leviticus 23: verses 33-36<br>
Festival of Booths, Festival of Tabernacles<br>
Festival of the Final Harvest, Festival of Ingathering<br>
Feast 7 of 7 is Sukkot (or Succoth)<br>
five days after the Day of Atonement.<br>
 This festival to the Lord will last for seven days.<br>
The first day and the day after the seventh day of festival 7 of 7 will be days of complete rest.<br>
Day 1 of 7 -- Sabbath, a day of complete rest. Do Not Work on this day.<br>
Day 7 of 7 -- Not a Sabbath.<br>
The Day AFTER Day 7 of 7 -- Sabbath, a day of complete rest. Do Not Work on this day.<br>
This so-called eighth day Sabbath starts at sunset on Day 7 of 7, when Day 7 of 7 comes to an end at sunset.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sha-Bot is the Hebrew way of saying, Sabbath, a holy, set-apart day of rest, normally on every Saturday and when indicated during a feast.<br>
The key thing about a Sabbath day is not to do any normal occupational work that makes you money or makes someone else money,<br>
do not cause any employee to work for you, and do not buy or sell or perform a transaction that causes any buying or selling between employers, employees, businesses and customers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Please note that there is a Jewish tradition with this feast 7 of 7 that is not in the Bible.<br>
The Jewish tradition is, if you are living outside the land of Israel,<br>
then Feast 7 of 7 is supposed to be eight days instead of seven.<br>
Under that tradition, for those living outside Israel, the first two days are Sabbath, Shabbat-like holidays.<br>
And then the seventh and eighth days are also Sabbath days.<br>
However, this is a Jewish tradition and the Bible does NOT command us to do any of this.<br>
It is only supposed to be for seven days, with the first day and the day AFTER the seventh day being Sabbath days of rest.<br>
Feast 7 of 7, Day 7 of 7 -- it is the last day of Sukkot, but it is Not a Sabbath.<br>
The eighth day is a Sabbath day of rest, but it is not a Sukkot day, and it is not part of Feast 7 of 7, which has now already ended at that point.<br>
There is no actual eighth day of Sukkot outside the Land of Israel.<br>
The Bible commands us to only do Sukkot for seven days.<br>
In summary, the Bible commands us to do only do the 7-day version and not the 8-day version of Feast 7 of 7.<br>

<br>
<br>
3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.<br>

<br>
4 For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.<br>
5 O Lord, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.<br>
6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.<br>
7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:<br>
8 But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore.<br>
9 For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.<br>
10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.<br>
11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.<br>
12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.<br>
13 Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.<br>
14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;<br>
(they shall be fat and green;)<br>

Here are some commentaries about a few important topics. These commentaries are here to help give you some ideas and advice on improving and strengthening the relationship that you have with the Lord God, Jesus Christ, and this can also help improve and strengthen the relationship that your family also has with the Lord God, Jesus Christ. In the Hebrew language, we can pronounce the name of our Heavenly Father and our Messiah and Saviour, like this: Yah, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.  The name of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, can be pronounced in Hebrew as, Yeh-Shoe-Uh, or, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
These commentaries are written from the perspective of a married man, a husband, doing these things for his wife, the woman he is married to, and his children, all living together in the same home.  Please feel free to apply this advice to your particular family situation.  For example, if we talk about the man going off to work and saying good-bye to his wife and children, please feel free to apply the advice and suggestions to your particular family circumstances, be it the wife going off to work, or a single mum leaving to go to work, or grown children living with their parents, leaving to go to work, or the boyfriend or girlfriend, or whatever size or shape your family happens to be at this time.  See what you can do to actually do some of these ideas and suggestions for your family and for the people that you love.<br>
<br>
<br>
When it comes to the definition of, Dad, Mum, parents, brothers and sisters, and the definition of family and relatives, just remember this little bit of Scripture that we looked at back when we were in Christian Essays 5...<br>
<br>
Matthew 12: 46-50 (KJV)<br>
46 Whilst he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.<br>
47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.<br>
48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?<br>
49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<br>
50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 12: 46-50 (NLT)<br>
46 As Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him.<br>
47 Someone told Jesus, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and they want to speak to you."<br>
48 Jesus asked, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"<br>
49 Then he pointed to his disciples and said, "Look, these are my mother and brothers.<br>
50 Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother!"<br>

<br>
The Successful Bible Attitude<br>
<br>
Commentary:  I once met a man who had graduated from University, and had a successful career for a few years as a manager of a large corporation. I happen to notice that he was wearing clothing that had some Christian content on it. I shifted the conversation in that direction and found out that he was a Believer and was attending a local Christian church. I then asked him, "Have you read the Bible?"<br>
<br>
He said, "Well, I tried reading it, but it was kind of hard to understand, so I stopped."<br>
<br>
I'm thinking to myself, you graduated from a college or University to get the successful manager position that you have today.  What would have happened if you would have had that same attitude in going to college?   You did not have that sort of attitude to make it through college, but you embrace that give-up, quitter's attitude in reading the Bible.  You kept on going to get something temporal, something that you will instantly lose when you die, but you gave-up real fast on trying to get something eternal, something that will last forever and ever, long after your physical body dies.<br>
<br>
The way how you make it through college, is the same way how you make it through reading the entire Bible, cover to cover. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, never give up.  We are running a race to get the prize of eternal life.  We're in the race to win the race.  We're in it to win it.  Winners never quit, and quitters never win. Would you just quit going to college if you read something in a textbook that was difficult for you to understand? Keep reading your Bible every day, even if it is just a page a day. If it's hard to understand, or boring, or if it is just a bunch of names and places that are hard to pronounce, keep on reading every day.  It's like taking vitamins and medications for your soul.  It's not much fun or enjoyable, taking a bunch of pills every day, but you know you need to do it if you are going to stay strong and healthy in the spirit.<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
Praying For Your Family<br>
<br>
This is just some personal advice on praying for your family, and how you can incorporate daily family prayers into your life each day.<br>
<br>
It is written from the perspective of a Father praying over his wife and children,<br>
but it could also be applied for a working mum praying over her husband and children.<br>
Or, if you're a single mum or dad, you can apply this prayer advice accordingly, to your particular family situation.<br>
<br>
Spend at least few minutes every day with your wife and with each child individually, and really try to seek out how they are doing, where they are at in their life at this moment in time, and what it is that they are having troubles and struggles with in the spirit and in life.  This quality time will show you what you need to pray about for your wife and for each child.<br>
<br>
Prayers for your Family at Bedtime<br>
<br>
Commentary:  At the end of every day, be sure to go to your wife, give her a kiss, and tell her that you love her.  Forgive her. If it was a difficult day, and things did not go well between you and her, do it anyway. Make sure you give her a kiss and tell her that you love her.  You never know if or when the day will come when you may not be able to do that ever again. Don't end the day in anger.  Forgive each other.  Forgive her and love her even if she is not really able to do that for you just yet.  Do this every night.  Tell her this over the phone each night if you can't be with her that night.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:26 KJV<br>
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4: 25-27 NLT<br>
25 So stop telling lies. Let us tell our neighbours the truth, for we are all parts of the same body.<br>
26 And "don't sin by letting anger control you." (that right there is a quote from Psalms 4:4) Don't let the sun go down whilst you are still angry,<br>
27 for anger gives a foothold to the devil.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 4:4 NLT<br>
Don't sin by letting anger control you.<br>
Think about it overnight and remain silent.<br>
<br>
Psalms 4:4 KJV<br>
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Go up to each one of your children as they lay in bed, about to go to sleep, and touch his or her cheek, and say to each one of them, "God's blessings, and go forth in Jesus."  If you want to say His name in Hebrew, then say, "Yaw-Who-Wah's blessings, and go forth in Yaw-Who-Shaw." Or you can say, "Yaw-Who-Wah's blessings, and go forth in Yeh-Shoe-Wuh."  Then, give that child a kiss, look into his or her eyes, and say, "I love you."  Do this every night.  Say it to each child over the phone each night if you can't be with him or her.<br>
<br>
<br>
Prayers for your Family Before You Go To Work<br>
<br>
Commentary: Go up to your wife, and to each child, tell them that you need to leave, give your wife and each child a kiss, and say a short, 30 second prayer for your wife, and for each child, and then, after the prayer, tell your wife and each child that you love him or her.  Yes, this does mean that you will need to get up and get ready to go a little bit earlier, to allow this extra time. Pray for each child and for your wife, with individual prayers for each one of them.  Each prayer for each person should not be less than 10 seconds, and really think about each person as you pray for him or her. Again, tell your wife and each child that you love him or her.  You never know if a day may come when you will no longer be able to do this.<br>

<a name="JAH15SACRDJAH"></a><h2>Sacred Name</h2>
<p>
<br>
The Big Deal About the Sacred Name<br>
<br>
Commentary: What is the big deal about actually saying the name of our Heavenly Father by pronouncing it in the actual Hebrew language? The Lord is not really his name. His real name is Yaw-Who-Wah. Every time you see, Lord, in all uppercase letters, that used to be, in Hebrew, Yaw-Who-Wah, before it was replaced with the English name, the Lord. Those who call on the name of the Lord will be saved.  There is power in the name of Jesus.  The actual name of Jesus Christ is Yaw-Who-Shaw, or, Yeh-Shoe-Wuh. Yet, in English, the incorrect names commonly pronounced in English, the Lord, Jesus Christ, can work just as well.  How can that be?<br>
<br>
I believe it is kind of like this. Let's say that my name is John.  If I am walking down the street, and someone across the street, or someone driving slowly down the street, calls out and says, Hey, Tyrone, I am not going to listen or respond to that name because my name is not Tyrone.  However, if I know that my friends, my family, and the people that I love, like to call me by the name (or nickname) of, Tyrone, then, because I know they like to call me by that name, then, if I hear someone call out the name of Tyrone, I will look, listen and respond to that, even though, technically, my name is actually John.<br>
<br>
In the same way, if I have a surname or last name that is difficult to pronounce, and I know what my surname sounds like when it is pronounced incorrectly, I will respond and answer to the incorrect pronunciation even though that is not the correct way to say my surname or last name.  I think that, millions of people got saved and safely deposited into Heaven with forgiveness and the free gift of eternal life, knowing only how to say the incorrect, English versions of His name, because our Lord and Saviour is smart about his name in the way described here. He knows when we are calling out to Him, ascending our prayers up to Him. But, now that you really know how to say is actual, real name, it feels good being able to say it every time we come across the English version in our English Bibles.<br>
<br>
Several years ago, Google purchased over 35 misspelled variations of their domain name, so that, if you quickly misspell Google dot com, and press enter, chances are, you will go to a webpage owned by Google that will instantly forward you to the correctly-spelled Google dot com webpage.  They did this so that someone would not make a fake Google search page based on someone misspelling the Google name.  Even if you spell Google incorrectly, your computer will take you to Google anyway, because Google bought those commonly misspelled domain names. I believe that our Heavenly Father God and his Beloved Son are much smarter than Google. If Google is smart enough to steer your misspelled Google name to Google dot com, I'm confident that our Heavenly Father God and his Beloved Son are intelligent enough to steer your prayer with your mispronounced English name or poorly pronounced Hebrew name right on up into the throne room, and right on up to the ears of the most high God, seated on that beautiful throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your relationship with the Lord is a growth and development process that happens in a series of stages.  Would you expect a brand new, 4-inch-tall seedling of an Apple tree to produce the full-size apples commonly found on a mature apple tree?  You can't expect a new-born baby to digest honey and steak, when the baby's body can only process breastmilk, and does not have any teeth to chew any food. The same thing is true for the development of your relationship as a Christian believer.  Getting angry or disappointed in someone who only knows how to say the English or Greek names of the Heavenly Father, Messiah and Holy Spirit, is like getting angry at a 5-year-old child who wants to be a doctor when he or she grows up, and all he or she can do at this stage in their life and education is to play with toys that resemble, or look like medical devices and equipment.  That stethoscope is not real, it's a toy.  How can you call yourself a doctor when you are so uneducated and only have pretend toys to work with?  Don't get angry at a person or a church that is stuck on teaching kindergarten or first grade elementary school Bible studies over and over again. Many people have not progressed or advanced their Bible education beyond the level of a five or six-year-old child's level of education!  That's why we are reading this and studying the Bible right now.  We want to go to the next level. Here is how the Christian relationship and maturity begins, grows and develops.<br>
<br>
This commentary right here is based on the book of Ezekiel 36: 25-27, which we already have looked at before, when we were in Christian Essays 12.<br>
The development and growth of your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ can be thought of like this.<br>
The breastmilk is doing Romans 10:9, believing that Jesus and the Lord God are one and the same, and that God raised Jesus up from the grave.  Next, start taking in solid foods by praying and asking the Lord Jesus to enter into your heart, your mind, your soul, your life, and let him do a transformation work in your heart and in your life.  Let him grab the mouse, the keyboard, the steering wheel, let him sit in the driver's seat, and let him fill out your list of things to do today, and your list of priorities and desires.<br>
<br>
Continue to read your Bible and pray, every single day, and he will put His desires and directions into your heart. He will give you knowledge, understanding and wisdom, and he will put into you the Fear Of The Lord.  He will help you change direction.  He will remove, cast out and do demolition work on what does not belong in you, what is not up to code, He will repair, edit and remodel what is broken, incorrect, inadequate or incomplete, and he will construct and create inside of you what is lacking or missing.<br>
<br>
After that, he will live in your heart and call your heart his home.  He will fill you with his spirit, the Holy spirit, the Spirit of the Lord, the Presence of the Lord, and the Glory of the Lord.  In Hebrew, we would say it like this.  He will fill you with his Hawk-Oh-Desh Roo-Awk, His Roo-Awk Hawk-Oh-Desh (The Holy Spirit, the Sprit that is holy, the set-apart breath of Yaw).  You will have compassion and forgiveness for yourself, your past, and for all of those who wronged you, and for all those you love and desire to help. You will be spirit-filled, and live a spirit-filled and spirit-directed life.  You will want to learn, remember, keep, guard and obey all of the commandments in the Old and New Testaments, the commandments of the Lord and the commandments of Jesus Christ, which is also the Lord God almighty. Instead of just eating the Fruit of the spirit, you will be able to grow, and develop your own fruit of the spirit, and you will want to distribute this fruit to others.  At this stage, you will want to know and obey all of the commandments, and it will become very obvious to you when you do the commandments and when you don't. Right and wrong, good and evil, will be very plain and obvious to you.<br>
<br>
But, here's the deal.  You can't obey all of the commandments perfectly all the time. That's why you needed Jesus to get you into heaven by Christ's mercy and grace, not based on your ability to obey all of the commandments.  So, how does this work?  You want to obey the commandments but you're getting into heaven and having your sin forgiven because of Christ's mercy and grace.  How does grace and commandment obedience work together like this?<br>
<br>
The salvation begins with grace, but then the relationship grows with obedience.<br>
<br>
Here is a story that illustrates this balance between grace, good works and commandment obedience. These are two examples that I heard explained from two different pastors a few years ago.<br>

The Grace and Obedience Relationship -- How Grace and Obedience Go Together<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
<br>
<br>
Driving on the Wrong Side<br>
<br>
Let's say, in this parable, that you get your driving licence for the first time and decide to start driving.  However, you are in the United States and you decide to drive on the left side of the road, for fun, on purpose.  The problem is that the law clearly states that, in the United States, all cars must drive on the right side of the road.  So, all the oncoming traffic, going the opposite direction, are driving towards you, all honking and trying to avoid a collision.  You do this for several seconds, and then a police officer pulls you over, arrests you, and takes you to court. The judge explains that you could have been killed or permanently crippled and disabled from breaking this law, and you could have killed someone else who was obeying the law.  Your sin does not just hurt you, your sin can also hurt innocent people around you. The judge says, pay nine thousand dollars right now or go to jail.  You don't have that kind of money at all.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, you see that Jesus is sitting right behind you, and He hands you a stack of cash that totals exactly nine thousand dollars.  You hand the cash to the judge.  The judge declares that the punishment, the fine, has been paid in full. You are free to go.<br>
<br>
Now that you know the seriousness of breaking this law, are you going to get right back into that car and keep on driving on the wrong side of the road?  You're forgiven, the debt has been paid in full by Jesus Christ, but are you just going to ignore the driving and traffic laws and just expect Jesus to bail you out every time?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 6:3<br>
KJV<br>
3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh....<br>
<br>
Commentary: That verse, Genesis 6:3, may suggest that, if you really are determined to sin, deliberately, on purpose, if you are determined to keep on driving on the wrong side of the road, knowing it is wrong, He may eventually take is hand of protection off of you and have you receive the harmful and destructive consequences of your sin.  If you're not going to learn the easy way, by studying and obeying the driver's manual, the instruction book, the entire Old and New Testament of the entire Bible, if you're not going to learn how to do things right, the easy way, by studying and obeying the law, then there will eventually be no other choice expect for you to learn the hard way, through discipline, correction and punishment. Ignorance of the law is not a legal defence in a court of law.  You will receive the consequences of disobeying or disregarding the law even if you don't know what the law is.  We all have disobeyed the law, the commandments, and now that Jesus has saved us and forgiven us and has set us free, we want to study, obey, guard and keep the law of the Lord, the Old and New Testament commandments, so that we can live a longer, better and happier life.<br>
<br>
The conclusion of this first parable is, now that we are set free because of what Jesus Christ did for us, we are forgiven if we accidentally break the law again, and we know that we may need to receive the consequences from even breaking the law accidentally, so let's really study the traffic and driving laws, and try our best to obey them, so that we don't end up in trouble again, or worse, hurt, crippled or even killed.  We are forgiven from sin, so let's keep trying to stay away from further future sin, so that we don't hurt ourselves or others.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Cut Off from Drugs<br>
<br>
The second parable is this.  You know that it is against the law to take a certain drug, but, for fun, you take it one time anyway.  You hallucinate that a big snake is eating your right arm, so you go into the garage and cut off the snake with your chainsaw.  The neighbours see you acting crazy, attacking a big snake over and over again with the chainsaw.  An ambulance just happens to drive by, and they stop then and there, and they start walking up to you. The drug is messing you up so bad with hallucinations, that you pass out.  The truth is that, because of the drug making you hallucinate, there was no actual snake, and you actually cut off your own right arm with the chainsaw, and you were shredding your own, amputated right arm with the chainsaw before you passed out.  Fortunately, the crew from the ambulance were able to put a tourniquet on you to stop the bleeding, and get you to the nearby hospital and replace the blood you lost.<br>
<br>
You believe in Jesus, you are saved and forgiven, and you know that someday you will be in Heaven forever with the Lord Jesus.  The problem is, because of your sin, disobeying the law about this illegal drug, you will spend the rest of your life here missing your right arm.  A car with a manual transmission, with a clutch and stick-shift, is no longer an option for you.   You can't play the drums as well, nor a piano quite the same, and you are not as fast with a computer keyboard and mouse anymore. You are forgiven, but your sin has cost you something.  If we would have obeyed the law to begin with, and stayed away from illegal drugs, we would have both of our arms.<br>
<br>
The conclusion of this parable is, sin hurts you and it can hurt the people around you, including the innocent people that were trying to obey the law to begin with.  Yes, we get to go into Heaven by the work on the Cross that Jesus did, and by his mercy and grace, but if we are still here, still not yet in heaven, let's know and study the law, and try our best to obey it and do it, so that our lives will be better for us, for our families, and for our children and grandchildren.   Teach these commandments and Sabbaths and feasts to your children, so they don't have to learn about the law the hard way.<br>

<a name="JAH15DETESTABOM"></a><h2>Hating Sin</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It's OK to Hate Sin<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: If you say that you do not hate anything, and that nothing offends you, then you do not have the Fear Of The Lord.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The things that the Lord hates are identified as being detestable and an abomination.<br>
An abomination is an idolatry of something that is morally disgusting.<br>
The Hebrew word for abomination appears 117 times in the Old Testament.<br>
A similar Hebrew word that can be translated as the English word, detestable,<br>
is also found 28 times in the Old Testament.<br>
It also refers to something that is disgusting, filthy and especially idolatrous.<br>
An idol can be like a fake god that you give glory, honour and worship to, and can result in you being addicted to or enslaved to this fake god, or idol.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 6: 16-19 (KJV)<br>
16 These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:<br>
(seven are an abomination of his soul:)<br>
17 (A proud look is also known as, Haughty eyes,) A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,<br>
<br>
18 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,<br>
19 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 6: 16-19 NLT<br>
16<br>
There are six things the Lord hates -- <br>
no, seven things he detests:<br>
17<br>
haughty eyes,<br>
a lying tongue,<br>
hands that kill the innocent,<br>
18<br>
a heart that plots evil,<br>
feet that race to do wrong,<br>
19<br>
a false witness who pours out lies,<br>
a person who sows discord in a family.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Zechariah 8:17 (KJV)<br>
And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 97:10 (KJV)<br>
Ye that love the Lord, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 8:13 (KJV)<br>
The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  If you do not hate those things, then you do not have the Fear Of The Lord.<br>
We will take a closer, deeper look at the Fear Of The Lord later on.<br>
<br>
Is there a Wrath Of God?<br>
<br>
John 3:36 (KJV)<br>
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.<br>
<br>
John 3:36 NLT<br>
And anyone who believes in God's Son has eternal life. Anyone who doesn't obey the Son will never experience eternal life but remains under God's angry judgement."<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 3:6 (KJV)<br>
For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:<br>
<br>
Colossians 3: 5 & 6 NLT<br>
5<br>
So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires. Don't be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater, worshipping the things of this world.<br>
6 <br>
Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming.<br>
(Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming on all who disobey him.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 2: 5-9 KJV<br>
5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgement of God;<br>
6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:<br>
7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:<br>
8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,<br>
9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil....<br>
<br>
Romans 2: 5-9 NLT<br>
5 But because you are stubborn and refuse to turn from your sin, you are storing up terrible punishment for yourself. For a day of anger is coming, when God's righteous judgement will be revealed.<br>
6 He will judge everyone according to what they have done.<br>
7 He will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good, seeking after the glory and honour and immortality that God offers.<br>
8 But he will pour out his anger and wrath on those who live for themselves, who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness.<br>
9 There will be trouble and calamity for everyone who keeps on doing what is evil....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5:6 (KJV)<br>
Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.<br>
<br>
<br>

5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<br>
6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.<br>
7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.<br>
8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5: 5-8 NLT<br>
5 You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is an idolater, worshipping the things of this world.<br>
6 Don't be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of God will fall on all who disobey him.<br>
7 Don't participate in the things these people do.<br>
8 For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light!<br>
<br>
<br>

2 Chronicles 30: 7-9 KJV<br>
7 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.<br>
(Now harden not your necks, as your fathers were, but give the hand yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.)<br>
8 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.<br>
9 For if ye turn again unto the Lord, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 30: 7-9 NLT<br>
7 Do not be like your ancestors and relatives who abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and became an object of derision, as you yourselves can see.<br>
8 Do not be stubborn, as they were, but submit yourselves to the Lord. Come to his Temple, which he has set apart as holy forever. Worship the Lord your God so that his fierce anger will turn away from you.<br>
9 "For if you return to the Lord, your relatives and your children will be treated mercifully by their captors, and they will be able to return to this land. For the Lord your God is gracious and merciful. If you return to him, he will not continue to turn his face from you."<br>

<p>
<br>
What is the Fear Of The Lord?<br>
How do we get and have The Fear Of The Lord?<br>
We touched on this before, a long time ago, when we were in Christian Essays 1.<br>

Commentary:<br>
Here is a commentary and an introduction on the book of Ecclesiasticus Sirach.<br>
This introduction will also be repeated again at the end of Christian Essays 20,<br>
The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 20.<br>
<br>
The book of Ecclesiasticus Sirach is not in the Bible any more.<br>
It used to be in the KJV when it was first released.<br>
The book of Ecclesiasticus Sirach is a Jewish work originally in Hebrew of ethical teachings, from approximately 200 to 175 BC, written by the Jewish scribe Ben Sira of Jerusalem, on the inspiration of his father Joshua son of Sirach, sometimes called Jesus son of Sirach or Yeshua ben Eliezer ben Sira.<br>
In Egypt, it was translated into Greek by the author's unnamed grandson, who added a prologue.<br>
In the prologue, the author's unnamed grandson mentions his grandfather Jesus, which would be his grandfather, Joshua son of Sirach, sometimes called Jesus son of Sirach or Yeshua ben Eliezer ben Sira.<br>
This prologue is generally considered the earliest witness to a canon of the books of the prophets, and thus the date of the text is the subject of intense scrutiny.<br>
Here is a look at Chapter 1 of this book of Ecclesiasticus Sirach.<br>

<br>
1 All wisdom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever.<br>
2 Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?<br>
3 Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the deep, and wisdom?<br>
4 Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.<br>
5 The word of God most high is the fountain of wisdom; and her ways are everlasting commandments.<br>
6 To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed? or who hath known her wise counsels?<br>
7 [Unto whom hath the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest? and who hath understood her great experience?]<br>
8 There is one wise and greatly to be feared, the Lord sitting upon his throne.<br>
9 He created her, and saw her, and numbered her, and poured her out upon all his works.<br>
10 She is with all flesh according to his gift, and he hath given her to them that love him.<br>
<br>
11 The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing.<br>
12 The fear of the Lord maketh a merry heart, and giveth joy, and gladness, and a long life.<br>
13 Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last, and he shall find favour in the day of his death.<br>
14 To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and it was created with the faithful in the womb.<br>
15 She hath built an everlasting foundation with men, and she shall continue with their seed.<br>
16 To fear the Lord is fulness of wisdom, and filleth men with her fruits.<br>
17 She filleth all their house with things desirable, and the garners with her increase.<br>
18 The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God: and it enlargeth their rejoicing that love him.<br>
19 Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understanding, and exalteth them to honour that hold her fast.<br>
20 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and the branches thereof are long life.<br>
21 The fear of the Lord driveth away sins: and where it is present, it turneth away wrath.<br>
<br>
22 A furious man cannot be justified; for the sway of his fury shall be his destruction.<br>
23 A patient man will bear for a time, and afterward joy shall spring up unto him.<br>
24 He will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.<br>
25 The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.<br>
26 If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give her unto thee.<br>
27 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction: and faith and meekness are his delight.<br>
28 Distrust not the fear of the Lord when thou art poor: and come not unto him with a double heart.<br>
29 Be not an hypocrite in the sight of men, and take good heed what thou speakest.<br>
30 Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul, and so God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation, because thou camest not in truth to the fear of the Lord, but thy heart is full of deceit.<br>

All wisdom comes from the Lord<br>

and the days of eternity -- who can count them?<br>
3<br>
The height of heaven, the breadth of the earth,<br>
the abyss, and wisdom -- who can search them out?<br>
4<br>
Wisdom was created before all things,<br>

And her abundant experience -- who has understood it?<br>
<br>
<br>
8<br>
There is One who is wise, greatly to be feared,<br>
sitting upon his throne.<br>
9<br>
The Lord himself created wisdom;<br>
(The Lord himself created her;)<br>
he saw her and apportioned her,<br>
he poured her out upon all his works.<br>
10<br>
She dwells with all flesh according to his gift,<br>
and he supplied her to those who love him.<br>

and gladness and a crown of rejoicing.<br>
12<br>

With him who fears the Lord it will go well at the end;<br>
on the day of his death he will be blessed.<br>
14<br>
To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;<br>
she is created with the faithful in the womb.<br>
<br>
(She made as nest amongst men an eternal foundation,)<br>
15<br>
She made amongst men an eternal foundation,<br>
and amongst their descendants she will be trusted.<br>
16<br>
To fear the Lord is wisdom's full measure;<br>
she satisfies men with her fruits;<br>
(she intoxicates men with her fruits;)<br>
<br>
17<br>
she fills their whole house with desirable goods,<br>
and their storehouses with her produce.<br>
18<br>
The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom,<br>
making peace and perfect health to flourish.<br>
19<br>
He saw her and apportioned her;<br>
he rained down knowledge and discerning comprehension,<br>
and he exalted the glory of those who held her fast.<br>
20<br>
To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom,<br>
and her branches are long life.<br>
<br>
21<br>
The fear of the Lord drives away sins;<br>
and where it abides, it will turn away all anger.<br>
<br>
<br>
22<br>
Unrighteous anger cannot be justified,<br>
for a man's anger tips the scale to his ruin.<br>
23<br>
A patient man will endure until the right moment,<br>
and then joy will burst forth for him.<br>
24<br>
He will hide his words until the right moment,<br>
and the lips of many will tell of his good sense.<br>
25<br>
In the treasuries of wisdom are wise sayings,<br>
but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.<br>
26<br>
If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments,<br>
and the Lord will supply it for you.<br>
27<br>
For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction,<br>
and he delights in fidelity and meekness.<br>
28<br>
Do not disobey the fear of the Lord;<br>
do not approach him with a divided mind.<br>
<br>
(Be not a hypocrite in the mouths of men,)<br>
29<br>
Be not a hypocrite in men's sight,<br>
and keep watch over your lips.<br>
30<br>
Do not exalt yourself lest you fall,<br>
and thus bring dishonour upon yourself.<br>
The Lord will reveal your secrets<br>
and cast you down in the midst of the congregation,<br>
because you did not come in the fear of the Lord,<br>
and your heart was full of deceit.<br>

<br>
16 Inspiring Quotes about Faith and the Bible from U.S. Presidents<br>
<br>
Written by Scott Slayton, a Contributor for ChristianHeadlines.com<br>
<br>
<br>
From the 16 quotes from U.S. Presidents about faith and the Bible, we will only select and read six of these quotes right now...<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Ulysses S. Grant<br>
"Hold fast to the Bible as the sheet-anchor of your liberties; write its precepts in your heart and practice them in your lives. To the influence of this book we are indebted for all the progress made in true civilisation, and to this we must look as our guide in the future."<br>
<br>
- Ulysses S. Grant, 18th President of the United States<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. Ronald Reagan<br>
"If we trust in Him, keep His word, and live our lives for His pleasure, He'll give us the power we need – power to fight the good fight, to finish the race, and to keep the faith."<br>
<br>
- Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. Barack Obama<br>
"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life."<br>
<br>
- Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States<br>
reported on 28 January 2015, in the Jerusalem Post, from a speech he made the day before, in New Delhi, India, on Tuesday 27 January 2015.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11. James Madison<br>
"We have staked the whole future of American civilisation not on the power of government, far from it. We have staked the whole of our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves according to the commandments of God. The future and success of America is not in this Constitution, but in the laws of God upon which this Constitution is founded."<br>
<br>
- James Madison, 4th President of the United States<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
13. Woodrow Wilson<br>
<br>
"The Bible is the one supreme source of revelation of the meaning of life, the nature of God, and spiritual nature and needs of men.  It is the only guide of life which really leads the spirit in the way of peace and salvation.  America was born a Christian nation.  America was born to exemplify that devotion to the elements of righteousness which are derived from the revelations of Holy Scripture."<br>
<br>
- Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
15. Harry Truman<br>
<br>
"The fundamental basis of this nation's laws was given to Moses on the Mount.  The fundamental basis of our Bill of Rights comes from the teachings we get from Exodus and Saint Matthew, from Isaiah and Saint Paul.... If we don't have a proper fundamental moral background, we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the State!"<br>
<br>
- Harry Truman, 33rd President of the United States<br>

Commentary:<br>
Read your Bible, and pray -- Every. Single. Day.<br>
The Bible is True.<br>
Not-In-The-Bible -- is not true.<br>
Do not take Not-In-The-Bible and treat it like it was in the Bible.<br>
Do not take Not-In-The-Bible and give it worth and worship as if it was in the Bible.<br>
Do not mix content from the Bible, and Not-In-The-Bible.<br>
Don't let Not-In-The-Bible creep into your heart and mind and soul, because Not-In-The-Bible is not true.<br>
How can you tell the difference between the Bible and Not-In-The-Bible?<br>
Read  and study your Bible every day. Don't just read it, study it.<br>
Then, when someone tries to take Not-In-The-Bible and they try to make it enter into you, you'll know it's wrong and not true.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Commentary: The Bible is not a springboard for you to brainstorm and launch new ideas, concepts and imaginations that do not actually exist in the Bible. It's not a brainstorming mechanism for you to invent content that is not really there. If someone says a statement about the Heavenly Father, the Messiah, the Holy Spirit, and the Bible, and they cannot immediately follow that statement with an actual, quoted Bible verse, then watch out!  Be careful!  If they can't follow up what they just said with an actual Bible verse quote, then it may not be true, and they may be just making it up. They could be misrepresenting the heart of the Lord, his name and his nature.  If the Bible does not go into detail on that topic, then maybe you should not go into detail on it either.  If it's not in the Bible, then perhaps it should not be in your Bible study.  Are you actually studying the Bible in that Bible study, or, are you studying some human sinner's personal thoughts, ideas and imaginations?<br>
<br>
If it's not in the Bible, then it's not true.  If someone says something, and you search the Scriptures and immediately find 10 or more Bible verses that clearly say the exact opposite of what that person said, then that person is a liar, that person is deceived and is following and worshipping another anti-christ. For example, one pastor tried to do a service for teenage youth, and the topic was, Are You Dateable?  During the youth service, the pastor said, I just can't seem to find anything in the Bible about dating.  I'm thinking to myself, that's because dating is not God's plan. If dating and the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship is not in the Bible, then that is not part of God's plan.  If it's not part of God's plan, then whose plan is it?  What does the Bible say about the intimate relationship between a man and a woman?  It's called marriage.<br>
<br>
Another example is the birth of Jesus Christ.  The Bible does mention the birth and the events surrounding it, but the Bible does not go into depth or detail about the date of His birth.  Why?  Because, it's not that important.  What's more important is the work He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection, resulting in the available gift of forgiveness of sins and Eternal Life with him forever in Heaven, in His Kingdom.<br>
<br>
And yet another example would be to do a Bible study on the Greek word that describes the cross that Jesus was hanging on.  An in-depth study on that Greek word for the cross that Jesus was nailed to is interesting.  It could be a cross that is like the shape of a lowercase letter t, or more like an uppercase letter T, or maybe it was a simple, large stake or singular wooden beam, or some kind of actual tree, but this technical detail is not something that the Bible focuses on very much.  Why? Because it was the work that He Finished and accomplished on that cross, and the debt that he paid in full by hanging on that cross, not the technical specifications of the cross itself, or the stake, or the beam or tree or whatever that wooden tree thing was that He used to make it possible for us to be saved.<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion, if you actually keep on praying every day, and reading and studying your Bible every day, every verse, every chapter, every page, every book, from cover to cover, going through all of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament, and you keep on doing this, you will be able to quickly identify the truth from the lies, the genuine from the counterfeit, the weeds from the wheat, the fruit of the spirit versus the works or fruit of the flesh, the real Yeh-Shoe-Uh, Yah-Who-Shaw Jesus Christ versus the fake and phony, hypocritical anti-christs, the right from the wrong and the good from the evil. It will be very difficult to be lied to, tricked and deceived when you know a strong and clear difference between the knowledge that is good and the knowledge that is evil.<br>
<br>
Let us pray. Dear Lord Jesus, Yah, ELL-Low-Heem, Yah-Who-Wah, Yah-Who-Shaw, help us love, and help, and forgive one another, and help us not to judge one another. Help us rescue, and minister to one another, but only if it is your will for us to do so, for those particular people, in that particular situation. Help us love and serve and help one another, without being hurt by someone else's sin, without becoming the victim of someone else's sin. Help us be bold, brave and courageous, and yet help us also be cautious, careful, and wise. Help us go to the people and places where we should go, and help us avoid the people and places that you want us to stay away from. Give us your good wisdom from above, guide us into all truth, help us walk the right steps, towards your peace, your protection, your provision, and your prosperity. Help us always have our hearts and minds, our eyes and ears, fixed on you.  Help us trust you, and obey you, and follow you. Help us with our belief in you, our faith in you, our trust, our confidence and our hope in you. Help us do all things through you. Put your hand over our hand as we hold your Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, and help us use it rightly, according to your will. Be our shield of faith, our refuge, and our strong tower of protection and safety. Guard our hearts with your righteousness, and guard our minds with your salvation, and bless our souls.  Forgive us, strengthen us, heal us, bless us, and protect us.  Bless, help, heal and strengthen the relationship that we each have with You, and Bless, help, heal and strengthen the relationships that we each have with each other, our friends, our families, our neighbours and the people that you bring into our lives. Bless our enemies, and those in opposition to you and your will and your word. Help us all repent and change direction according to your will. May your love, your joy, your peace, your mercy and your grace be with us all. We lift all of these burdens, concerns and cares up to you and we pray for all of these things in the name of the Heavenly Father, Yah ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah, in the name of the Lord and saviour, Messiah Yah-Who-Shaw, and in the name of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit that is Holy, the Haw-Koh-Desh Roo-Awk, the Roo-Awk, Haw-Koh-Desh. In the name of Jesus Christ, Aw-Main, Amen, so be it, let it become true. Hallelujah!<br>

There are two very amazing songs from a particular band that I would like to share with you.<br>
This band has actually had several very popular Christian Hits over the years, but we will just talk about two of their songs for now.<br>
We will take a look at the lyrics to two of their songs here, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
But, let's first take a moment to talk about this band, started by two brothers.<br>
<br>
Both of these two brothers were born in Australia.<br>
Joel David Smallbone was born in 1984,<br>
and his brother, Luke James Smallbone was born in 1986.<br>
They moved from Sydney, Australia, to Nashville, Tennessee in 1991,<br>
due to their dad having his job relocated to there.<br>
They are the younger brothers of Christian recording artist and speaker, Rebecca St. James.<br>
The Smallbone brothers began performing as a band in 2007, and eventually<br>
changed the name of the band to the name, for King & Country,<br>
<br>
For King & Country's second album, titled,<br>
Run Wild. Live Free. Love Strong. -- was released on 16 September 2014.<br>
From this album, let's take a look at the words to the 2014 song, Shoulders.<br>
<br>
Here are the lyrics to the song, Shoulders, by, for King & Country...<br>
<br>
When confusion's my companion<br>
And despair holds me for ransom<br>
I will feel no fear<br>
I know that You are near<br>
<br>
When I'm caught deep in the valley<br>
With chaos for my company<br>
I'll find my comfort here<br>
'Cause I know that You are near<br>
<br>
<br>
My help comes from You<br>
You're right here, pulling me through<br>
You carry my weakness, my sickness, my brokenness all on Your shoulders<br>
Your shoulders<br>
My help comes from You<br>
You are my rest, my rescue<br>
I don't have to see to believe that You're lifting me up on Your shoulders<br>
Your shoulders<br>
<br>
You mend what once was shattered<br>
And You turn my tears to laughter<br>
Your forgiveness is my fortress<br>
Oh Your mercy is relentless<br>
<br>
<br>
My help comes from You<br>
You're right here, pulling me through<br>
You carry my weakness, my sickness, my brokenness all on Your shoulders<br>
Your shoulders<br>
My help comes from You<br>
You are my rest, my rescue<br>
I don't have to see to believe that You're lifting me up on Your shoulders<br>
Your shoulders<br>
<br>
My help is from You<br>
Don't have to see it to believe it<br>
My help is from you<br>
Don't have to see it, 'cause I know, 'cause I know it's true<br>
<br>
My help is from You<br>
Don't have to see it to believe it<br>
My help is from you<br>
Don't have to see it, 'cause I know, 'cause I know it's true<br>
<br>
<br>
My help comes from You<br>
You're right here, pulling me through<br>
You carry my weakness, my sickness, my brokenness all on Your shoulders<br>
Your shoulders<br>
My help comes from You<br>
You are my rest, my rescue<br>
I don't have to see to believe that You're lifting me up on Your shoulders<br>
Your shoulders<br>
<br>
My help is from You<br>
Don't have to see it to believe it<br>
My help is from you<br>
Don't have to see it, 'cause I know, 'cause I know it's true<br>
<br>
<br>
My help is from You<br>
Trying to see it to believe it<br>
My help is from you<br>
Trying to see it, 'cause I know, 'cause I know it's true<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, we're going to look at the lyrics to another song by, for King & Country.<br>
From their third studio album, titled, Burn the Ships, which first came out on 5 October 2018,<br>
the song we are going to look at next, is titled, God Only Knows.<br>
<br>
To promote this third album, Burn the Ships, this song, God Only Knows, was originally released as a third promotional single and music video on 27 July 2018.<br>
For some reason, it did not seem to gain much popularity in 2018.<br>
So, they released it again as a single on 11 January 2019, specifically to Christian radio stations.<br>
In 2019, it climbed up and became the Number Two most popular Christian song where it stayed there at Number Two for over four months, a record nineteen weeks.<br>
<br>
<br>
God Only Knows was also remixed by Timbaland, and there is also an alternate version that included Dolly Parton.<br>
<br>
In summary, the song was first around in 2018, but did not really become popular until 2019.<br>
<br>
From the band, for King & Country, here are the words to the 2018 song, God Only Knows.<br>
<br>
<br>
Wide awake while the world is sound asleepin'<br>
Too afraid of what might show up while you're dreamin'<br>
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you<br>
Nobody, nobody would believe you<br>
Every day you try to pick up all the pieces<br>
All the memories, they somehow never leave you<br>
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you<br>
Nobody, nobody would believe you<br>
<br>
God only knows what you've been through<br>
God only knows what they say about you<br>
God only knows how it's killing you<br>
But there's a kind of love that God only knows<br>
<br>
God only knows what you've been through<br>
God only knows what they say about you<br>
But God only knows the real you<br>
There's a kind of love that God only knows<br>
<br>
There's a kind of love that<br>
There's a kind of love<br>
<br>
You keep a cover over every single secret<br>
So afraid if someone saw them they would leave<br>
But Somebody, somebody, somebody sees you<br>
Somebody, somebody will never leave you<br>
<br>
God only knows what you've been through<br>
God only knows what they say about you<br>
God only knows how it's killing you<br>
But there's a kind of love that God only knows<br>
<br>
God only knows what you've been through<br>
God only knows what they say about you<br>
But God only knows the real you<br>
There's a kind of love that God only knows<br>
<br>
There's a kind of love that<br>
There's a kind of love<br>
There's a kind of love that<br>
There's a kind of love<br>
<br>
For the lonely, for the ashamed<br>
The misunderstood, and the ones to blame<br>
What if we could start over<br>
We could start over<br>
We could start over<br>
<br>
Oh!<br>
For the lonely, for the ashamed<br>
The misunderstood, and the ones to blame<br>
What if we could start over<br>
We could start over<br>
We could start over<br>
<br>
'Cause there's a kind of love that God only knows<br>
<br>
God only knows what you've been through<br>
God only knows what they say about you<br>
But God only knows the real you<br>
There's a kind of love that God only knows<br>

God only knows what you've been through<br>
God only knows what they say about you<br>
God only knows the real you<br>
There's a kind of love that God only knows<br>
<br>
There's a kind of love that<br>
There's a kind of love<br>
There's a kind of love that<br>
There's a kind of love<br>
<br>
God only knows where to find you<br>
God only knows how to break through<br>
God only knows the real you<br>
There's a kind of love that<br>
God only knows<br>

John 14:1 -- KJV<br>
Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14:27 -- KJV<br>
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14, all of Chapter 14, 31 verses total.<br>
KJV<br>
1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.<br>
2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<br>
3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.<br>
4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.<br>
5 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?<br>
6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>
7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.<br>
8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.<br>
9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?<br>
10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.<br>
11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.<br>
12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.<br>
13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<br>
14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.<br>
15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.<br>
16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;<br>
17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.<br>
18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<br>
19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.<br>
20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<br>
21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.<br>
22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?<br>
23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.<br>
24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.<br>
25 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.<br>
26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.<br>
27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.<br>
28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.<br>
29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.<br>
30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.<br>
31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the chapter just before this one, John 13,<br>
Jesus Washes His Disciples' Feet,<br>
Jesus Predicts His Betrayal, and<br>
Jesus Predicts Peter's Triple Denial.<br>
<br>
So now, let's look at John 14 again in the NLT.<br>
John 14, all of Chapter 14, 31 verses total.<br>
NLT<br>
<br>
1"Don't let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God, and trust also in me.<br>
<br>
(There are many rooms in my Father's house. If this were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.)<br>
2 There is more than enough room in my Father's home. If this were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?<br>
<br>
<br>
3 When everything is ready, I will come and get you, so that you will always be with me where I am.<br>
4 And you know the way to where I am going."<br>
5 "No, we don't know, Lord," Thomas said. "We have no idea where you are going, so how can we know the way?"<br>
6 Jesus told him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.<br>
7 If you had really known me, you would know who my Father is. From now on, you do know him and have seen him!"<br>
(If you have really known me, you will know who my Father is.)<br>
<br>
8 Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied."<br>
9 Jesus replied, "Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and yet you still don't know who I am? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father! So why are you asking me to show him to you?<br>
10 Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak are not my own, but my Father who lives in me does his work through me.<br>
11 Just believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or at least believe because of the work you have seen me do.<br>
12 "I tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works, because I am going to be with the Father.<br>
13 You can ask for anything in my name, and I will do it, so that the Son can bring glory to the Father.<br>
14 Yes, ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it!<br>
<br>
(If you love me, you will obey my commandments. If you love me, you should obey my commandments.)<br>
15 "If you love me, obey my commandments.<br>
16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, who will never leave you.<br>
<br>
(The Advocate who will never leave you, He is also known as the Holy Spirit, the Advocate, the Comforter, Encourager, or Counsellor. The original Greek word right there is, Paraclete.)<br>
<br>
<br>
17 He is the Holy Spirit, who leads into all truth. The world cannot receive him, because it isn't looking for him and doesn't recognise him. But you know him, because he lives with you now and later will be in you (and is in you).<br>
<br>
<br>
18 No, I will not abandon you as orphans -- I will come to you.<br>
19 Soon the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Since I live, you also will live.<br>
20 When I am raised to life again, you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.<br>
21 Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them."<br>
22 Judas (not Judas Iscariot, but the other disciple with that name) said to him, "Lord, why are you going to reveal yourself only to us and not to the world at large?"<br>
23 Jesus replied, "All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.<br>
24 Anyone who doesn't love me will not obey me. And remember, my words are not my own. What I am telling you is from the Father who sent me.<br>
25 I am telling you these things now whilst I am still with you.<br>
26 But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative -- that is, the Holy Spirit -- he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you.<br>
27 "I am leaving you with a gift -- peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don't be troubled or afraid.<br>
28 Remember what I told you: I am going away, but I will come back to you again. If you really loved me, you would be happy that I am going to the Father, who is greater than I am.<br>
29 I have told you these things before they happen so that when they do happen, you will believe.<br>
30 "I don't have much more time to talk to you, because the ruler of this world approaches. He has no power over me,<br>
31 but I will do what the Father requires of me, so that the world will know that I love the Father. Come, let's be going.<br>

<br>
We looked at a good chunk of the next chapter, John 15, when we were in<br>
Christian Essays 8, and we have studied another area of John 15<br>
when we were in Christian Essays 11.<br>
John 15 talks about Jesus being the True Vine, and it talks about<br>
The World's Hatred (If the world hates you, remember that it hated Jesus first.)<br>
and then He teaches more about the Holy Spirit, and that teaching continued into chapter 16.<br>
<br>
We now conclude this Bible study with a prayer that is based on the teachings of Jesus,<br>
using the teaching content found in the book of John, chapters 12 through 17.<br>
<br>
Let us pray.<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, dear Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
We call on the name of our Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
Thank you for your Triumph and victory over all sin, so that we, too, may be more than conquerors through you.<br>
Open our eyes, so that we may see.<br>
Open our ears, so that we may hear what your good, Holy Spirit is saying.<br>
Heal, guard and strengthen our thoughts, our dreams, our hearts, minds and souls, so that we may obey, follow and understand.<br>
Help us know you even more and more.<br>
We turn to you now. Heal us now, save us now and help us now.<br>
Help us be not just believers, but your Disciples.<br>
Thank you for washing our feet and washing us in the Water of your Word that became flesh and dwelt among us.<br>
Thank you, Jesus, for being and showing us the Way to the Father, through you.<br>
Thank you for sending us the Holy Spirit. Help us obey your commandments.<br>
Help us do The Work of the Holy Spirit.<br>
Keep us always connected to you, the True Vine.<br>
Guard us and protect us from The World's Hatred towards you and towards us.<br>
Take our Sadness and let it Be Turned into Joy.<br>
Thank you for giving us your peace, which is the peace that only you can give.<br>
Let us joyfully receive your peace and walk towards and walk in your peace.<br>
Bless and guard our thoughts and our dreams, and give us a sound mind.<br>
We praise you and we thank you for your joy, your strength, your power, your love, your mercy, your grace, your Word, your faithfulness,<br>
your truth, your peace, your righteousness, your wisdom, your salvation, your compassion and your forgiveness.<br>
We pray for all of these things in the name of Jesus Christ,<br>
in the name of Yaw-Who-Shaw, Yeh-Shoe-Uh, Ah-Main, Amen.<br>
