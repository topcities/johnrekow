<br>
Daniel 7: 22-28 (KJV)<br>
22 ...judgement was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.<br>
23 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.<br>
24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.<br>
25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.<br>
26 But the judgement shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.<br>
27 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all (rulers and all) dominions shall serve and obey him.<br>
28 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 7: 22-28 NLT<br>
22 ...the Ancient One -- the Most High -- came and judged in favour of his holy people. Then the time arrived for the holy people to take over the kingdom.<br>
23 Then he said to me, "This fourth beast is the fourth world power that will rule the earth. It will be different from all the others. It will devour the whole world, trampling and crushing everything in its path.<br>
24 Its ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another king will arise, different from the other ten, who will subdue three of them.<br>
25 He will defy the Most High and oppress the holy people of the Most High. He will try to change their sacred festivals and laws, and they will be placed under his control for a time, times, and half a time.<br>
26 "But then the court will pass judgement, and all his power will be taken away and completely destroyed.<br>
27 Then the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will last forever, and all rulers will serve and obey him."<br>
28 That was the end of the vision. I, Daniel, was terrified by my thoughts and my face was pale with fear, but I kept these things to myself.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Go back and read verse 25 again.<br>
That has already been happening, is happening now, and will happen even more so in the end times and the Tribulation.<br>
Verse 25 has already resulted in Sabbath on Sunday, Christmas, Saint Valentine's Day, Easter, Lent, Fat Tuesday, Ash Wednesday, Halloween Harvest Festivals, and "dating".<br>
None of these things are in the Bible, and the Bible does not tell us to do any of these things, and yet Christian Churches everywhere continue to do them.<br>
This is bad, and it's going to get worse before it gets better.<br>

<br>
Fruitful<br>
<br>
This Bible study, about fruit, leads into the next one, about the Trinity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 5:22-26 (KJV)<br>
22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,<br>
23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.<br>
24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.<br>
25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<br>
26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.<br>
<br>
Galatians 5:22-26 NLT<br>
22 But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<br>
23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!<br>
24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there.<br>
25 Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit's leading in every part of our lives. <br>
26 Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5: 7-12 (KJV)  Before we read this next section, let's take a special look at verse 9...<br>
(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5: 7-12 KJV<br>
7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.<br>
8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:<br>
9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)<br>
10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.<br>
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.<br>
12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5: 7-12 NLT<br>
7 Don't participate in the things these people do.<br>
8 For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light!<br>
9 For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true.<br>
10 Carefully determine what pleases the Lord.<br>
11 Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them.<br>
12 It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 8:19 (KJV)<br>
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 8:19 NLT<br>
19<br>
My gifts are better than gold, even the purest gold,<br>
my wages better than sterling silver!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 12:12 (KJV)<br>
The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 12:12 NLT<br>
12<br>
Thieves are jealous of each other's loot,<br>
but the godly are well rooted and bear their own fruit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Amos 8:1 (KJV)<br>
Thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:17 (KJV)<br>
Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.<br>
<br>
James 3:18 (KJV)<br>
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.<br>
<br>
James 3: 17 & 18 NLT<br>
17 wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and the fruit of good deeds. It shows no favouritism and is always sincere.<br>
18 And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness, (a harvest of good things, and a harvest of justice).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 11:30 (KJV)<br>
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 11:30 NLT<br>
30<br>
The seeds of good deeds become a tree of life;<br>
a wise person wins friends (and those who win souls are wise).<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 15-20 KJV<br>
15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.<br>
16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?<br>
17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.<br>
18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.<br>
19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<br>
20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
<br>
Matthew 7: 15-20 NLT<br>
15 "Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves.<br>
16 You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way they act. Can you pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?<br>
17 A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit.<br>
18 A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.<br>
19 So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.<br>
20 Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify people by their actions.<br>
<br>
Luke 6: 42-46 KJV<br>
42 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.<br>
43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.<br>
44 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.<br>
45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.<br>
46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?<br>
<br>
Luke 6: 39-46 NLT<br>
39 Then Jesus gave the following illustration: "Can one blind person lead another? Won't they both fall into a ditch?<br>
40 (Disciples are not greater than their teacher.) Students are not greater than their teacher. But the student who is fully trained will become like the teacher.<br>
41 "And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye (or, why worry about a speck in your brother's eye,) when you have a log in your own?<br>
42 How can you think of saying, 'Friend, (or, Brother,) let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.<br>
43 "A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.<br>
44 A tree is identified by its fruit. Figs are never gathered from thornbushes, and grapes are not picked from bramble bushes.<br>
45 A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart, and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart. What you say flows from what is in your heart.<br>
46 "So why do you keep calling me 'Lord, Lord!' when you don't do what I say?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 15: 1-10 KJV<br>
1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.<br>
2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.<br>
3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.<br>
4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.<br>
5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.<br>
6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.<br>
7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<br>
8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.<br>
9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.<br>
10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<br>
<br>
John 15: 1-10 NLT<br>
1 "I am the true grapevine, and my Father is the gardener.<br>
2 He cuts off every branch of mine that doesn't produce fruit, and he prunes the branches that do bear fruit so they will produce even more.<br>
3 You have already been pruned and purified by the message I have given you.<br>
4 Remain in me, and I will remain in you. For a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed from the vine, and you cannot be fruitful unless you remain in me.<br>
5 "Yes, I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart from me you can do nothing.<br>
6 Anyone who does not remain in me is thrown away like a useless branch and withers. Such branches are gathered into a pile to be burned.<br>
7 But if you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it will be granted!<br>
8 When you produce much fruit, you are my true disciples. This brings great glory to my Father.<br>
9 "I have loved you even as the Father has loved me. Remain in my love.<br>
10 When you obey my commandments, you remain in my love, just as I obey my Father's commandments and remain in his love.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 21: 18-20 (KJV)<br>
18 Now in the morning as (Jesus) returned into the city, he hungered.<br>
19 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.<br>
20 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!<br>
<br>
Matthew 21: 18 & 19 NLT:<br>
18 In the morning, as Jesus was returning to Jerusalem, he was hungry,<br>
19 and he noticed a fig tree beside the road. He went over to see if there were any figs, but there were only leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the fig tree withered up.<br>
<br>
Commentary: A single, lonely fruit tree may not be fruitful unless it is around other fruit trees of its same name, so that the cross-pollination will cause the flowers to grow into fruits.<br>
A Christian who chooses to forsake the assembling of ourselves together, not fellowshipping, not going to church and Bible Studies, being all alone, can also make one to be not fruitful as well.<br>
You call that an apple tree?  Where are the apples? Plant more apple trees of its same variety to increase its chance of being fruitful.<br>
You call yourself a Christian? Where is the fruit that proves that you are a Christian? Where is the Fruit of the Spirit?<br>
Fruit trees are more likely to be more fruitful when two or more of the same name are planted together.<br>
Christians increase their chance of becoming more fruitful when they all gather together in the name of Jesus.<br>
One important part of this, is that the gathering is of the same kind, of the same name of Jesus.<br>
Do not mix different kinds, and different names when you plant together, and assemble together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:24-25<br>
KJV: And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.<br>
NLT: Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.<br>
<br>
Matthew 18:20 KJV<br>
For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.<br>
<br>
Matthew 18: 19 & 20 NLT<br>
If two of you agree here on earth concerning anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.<br>
20 For where two or three gather together as my followers, (For where two or three gather together in my name,) I am there amongst them."<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22: 9-12 KJV<br>
9 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: (lest the fullness of the seed which thou hast sown,) lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.<br>
10 Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together.<br>
11 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together.<br>
12 (Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four wings of thy vesture,) Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22: 9-12 NLT<br>
9 "You must not plant any other crop between the rows of your vineyard. If you do, you are forbidden to use either the grapes from the vineyard or the other crop.<br>
10 "You must not plough with an ox and a donkey harnessed together.<br>
11 "You must not wear clothing made of wool and linen woven together.<br>
12 "You must put four tassels on the hem of the cloak with which you cover yourself -- on the front, back, and sides.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 19:19 KJV<br>
19 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.<br>
<br>
Leviticus 19:19 NLT<br>
19 "You must obey all my decrees.<br>
"Do not mate two different kinds of animals. Do not plant your field with two different kinds of seed. Do not wear clothing woven from two different kinds of thread.<br>
<br>
The original Hebrew meaning for, four quarters, was, four wings.  There are other places that mention four wings, but that's another Bible study.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 1:6 (KJV)<br>
And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 10:21 (KJV)<br>
Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.<br>
<br>
Anyway, although there are additional verses and stories about that, for now, here is one last verse to look at that warns us against mixing, mingling and merging...<br>
<br>
Genesis 28:1 (KJV)<br>
And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.<br>
<br>
Genesis 28:1 NLT:<br>
So Isaac called for Jacob, blessed him, and said, "You must not marry any of these Canaanite women."<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 4: 9-12 KJV<br>
9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.<br>
10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.<br>
11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?<br>
12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 4: 9-12 NLT<br>
9 Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed.<br>
10 If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble.<br>
11 Likewise, two people lying close together can keep each other warm. But how can one be warm alone?<br>
12 A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.<br>
<br>
Commentary: A rope made of three cords braided together is also a picture of the trinity. We will take a look at the trinity in the next Bible Study.<br>

<br>
Trinity<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Trinity<br>
<br>
1 * 1 * 1 = 1<br>
<br>
We saw last time, a little something tucked into the end of Ecclesiastes 4: verse 12.<br>
KJV: ...a threefold cord is not quickly broken.<br>
NLT: ...Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.<br>
<br>
Commentary: A rope made of three cords braided together is also a picture of the trinity.<br>
It's made of three cords, braided together, but when you look at it as a whole, you have one really strong rope, as the three cords are working together as one.<br>
There are many uses for rope when one is out in the wilderness. Beds used to be made from rope, which is where we got the expression, Sleep Tight.<br>
Ropes help you go up a cliff (into heaven) and they can help you not fall down the cliff (down into sin, death and hell).<br>
Ropes help make bridges, and help those in the outdoors in many, many ways. Jesus is like having strong rope. Jesus gives you rest, He is the bridge to cross the great divide, because of the cross to bridge the great divide.<br>
Many of the things that rope can do, can also be a picture of what Jesus does for us. Think about what rope is used for, and you'll be thinking about what Jesus does for us.<br>
<br>
The actual word, Trinity, is not in the Bible, but there are more than 20 areas in the New Testament, where, within each single verse, the verse has references to God, The Father, the Lord, and Jesus Christ, the Son, and the Spirit, the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost.<br>
We will look at just a few of the more obvious verses here, but there are many more in addition to the few that we will see here.<br>
<br>
Some people have said...<br>
If you try to explain the Trinity, you will lose your mind. But if you deny it, you will lose your soul.<br>
<br>
That might sound like a cool thing to say, but it is not in the Bible, because it is in direct opposition to what the Bible says.<br>
 <br>
Matthew 13:11 KJV<br>
...it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians, chapter 2<br>
verse 7<br>
we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory<br>
<br>
then we skip to verse 9<br>
Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<br>
10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.<br>
11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.<br>
12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.<br>
13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians, chapter 2 NLT<br>
Again, verse 7<br>
(But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery.)<br>
...the wisdom we speak of is the mystery of God -- his plan that was previously hidden, even though he made it for our ultimate glory before the world began.<br>
<br>
and then, jumping again to verse 9 in the NLT<br>
<br>
"No eye has seen, no ear has heard,<br>
and no mind has imagined<br>
what God has prepared<br>
for those who love him."<br>
(quoting from Isa 64:4)<br>
<br>
(For it was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit.)<br>
10 But it was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit. For his Spirit searches out everything and shows us God's deep secrets.<br>
11 No one can know a person's thoughts except that person's own spirit, and no one can know God's thoughts except God's own Spirit.<br>
12 And we have received God's Spirit (not the world's spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us.<br>
13 When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit's words to explain spiritual truths.<br>
(we speak words given to us by the Spirit, explaining spiritual truths in spiritual language, explaining spiritual truths to spiritual people.)<br>
(But people who don't have the Spirit, who have only physical life, can't receive these truths from God's Spirit.)<br>
14 But people who aren't spiritual can't receive these truths from God's Spirit. It all sounds foolish to them and they can't understand it, for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means.<br>
<br>
That was verse 14 in the NLT. If we just jump a few verses ahead, to verse 18, and switch it back to the KJV, we read this...<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1:18<br>
For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1:18 NLT:<br>
The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some places where we see the trinity...<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 28:19<br>
19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 3:21-22 KJV<br>
21 Now when all the people were baptised, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptised, and praying, the heaven was opened,<br>
22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 15: verse 16, verse 26 and 27 (KJV)<br>
<br>
16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.<br>
26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:<br>
27 And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next verse is kind of a follow-up to the verses that we just read.<br>
It is not really showing the full trinity, but it at least has Jesus telling us a little bit about the Holy Ghost.<br>
I just thought I'd throw it in here, because it's cool, and it just kind of goes along with what we just read...<br>
<br>
John 16: 7 & 8 (KJV)<br>
7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.<br>
8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgement:<br>
<br>
And, so, we finish up here with one last example of a verse the contains references to the trinity.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 13:14 KJV<br>
14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.<br>
<br>

Psalms 19: selected parts of verses 9 and 10, NLT.<br>
The laws of the Lord are...sweeter than honey,<br>
even honey dripping from the comb.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 1: Verses 1 through 4, and then we will skip to verse 14 KJV<br>
1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>
2 The same was in the beginning with God.<br>
3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.<br>
4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.<br>
verse 14:<br>
14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 1: Verses 1 through 4, and then we will skip to verse 14 NLT<br>
1<br>
In the beginning the Word already existed.<br>
The Word was with God,<br>
and the Word was God.<br>
2<br>
He existed in the beginning with God.<br>
3<br>
God created everything through him,<br>
and nothing was created except through him.<br>
4<br>
The Word gave life to everything that was created. (And nothing that was created was created except through him.) The Word gave life to everything.<br>
and his life brought light to everyone.<br>
14<br>
So the Word became human (the Word became flesh) and made his home amongst us. He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness. (He was full of grace and truth.) And we have seen his glory, the glory of the Father's one and only Son.<br>

The book of 1 Corinthians 10: 1-4 KJV<br>
1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;<br>
2 And were all baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;<br>
3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;<br>
4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.<br>
<br>
The book of 1 Corinthians 10: 1-4 NLT<br>
1 I don't want you to forget, dear brothers and sisters, about our ancestors in the wilderness long ago. All of them were guided by a cloud that moved ahead of them, and all of them walked through the sea on dry ground.<br>
2 In the cloud and in the sea, all of them were baptised as followers of Moses.<br>
3 All of them ate the same spiritual food,<br>
4 and all of them drank the same spiritual water. For they drank from the spiritual rock that travelled with them, and that rock was Christ.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Exodus 17: 6 & 7 KJV<br>
6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.<br>
7 (And he called the name of the place Temptation, and Chiding, or Strife.) And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord amongst us, or not?<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 17: 6 & 7 NLT<br>
6 I will stand before you on the rock at (Mount Horeb, or) Mount Sinai. (The Hebrew name of Horeb, is another name for Sinai.) Strike the rock, and water will come gushing out. Then the people will be able to drink." So Moses struck the rock as he was told, and water gushed out as the elders looked on.<br>
7 Moses named the place Massah (which means "test") and Meribah (which means "arguing") because the people of Israel argued with Moses and tested the Lord by saying, "Is the Lord here with us or not?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 20: We read a little bit of verse 1, and then we skip down to verses 13 and 14.<br>
<br>
1...the people abode in Kadesh....<br>
13 (This is the water of Strife.) This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.<br>
14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom....<br>
<br>
In verse 1 of the NLT, it mentions that this happened in the first month of the year.<br>
The first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of March and April. <br>
The number of years since leaving Egypt is not specified.<br>
<br>
Numbers 20:13. We read a little bit of verse 1, and then we skip down to verses 13 and 14. NLT<br>
1 In the first month of the year, the whole community of Israel arrived in the wilderness of Zin and camped at Kadesh. <br>
13 This place was known as the waters of Meribah (which means "arguing") because there the people of Israel argued with the Lord, and there he demonstrated his holiness amongst them.<br>
14 Whilst Moses was at Kadesh, he sent ambassadors to the king of Edom <br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Moses named the rock at Rephidim and the one at Kadesh the same name, 'Meribah.'<br>
At both locations, it was the same rock because it travelled with them and accompanied Israel on their journey.<br>
<br>
We just looked at all of that so that we can enjoy all the parts and pieces of Psalms 81.<br>
Psalms 81 has many story references.<br>
It starts with the passover, Jesus, and ends with the bread of life, the law of the Lord, honey, coming out of the rock, Jesus.<br>

All of Psalms 81, all 16 verses, KJV<br>
To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of Asaph. (A Psalm for Asaph.)<br>
1 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.<br>
2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.<br>
3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.<br>
4 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.<br>
5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, (when he went out against the land of Egypt,) when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.<br>
6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots (his hands passed away from the pots).<br>
7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: (I proved thee at the waters of Strife,) I proved thee at the waters of Meribah.<br>
Selah.<br>
8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;<br>
9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.<br>
10 I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.<br>
11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.<br>
(So I gave them up to the hardness of their hearts, I gave them up to the hardness of their imagination.)<br>
12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.<br>
13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!<br>
14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.<br>
(The haters of the Lord should have yielded feigned obedience. The haters of the Lord should have lied.)<br>
15 The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.<br>
(He should have fed them also with the fat of wheat.)<br>
16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.<br>
<br>

<br>
All of Psalms 81, all 16 verses, NLT<br>
1<br>
Sing praises to God, our strength.<br>
Sing to the God of Jacob.<br>
2<br>
Sing! Beat the tambourine.<br>
Play the sweet lyre and the harp.<br>
3<br>
Blow the ram's horn at new moon,<br>
and again at full moon to call a festival!<br>
4<br>
For this is required by the decrees of Israel;<br>
it is a regulation of the God of Jacob.<br>
5<br>
(He made it a law for Joseph.)<br>
He made it a law for Israel<br>
when he attacked Egypt to set us free.<br>
I heard an unknown voice say,<br>
6<br>
"Now I will take the load from your shoulders;<br>
I will free your hands from their heavy tasks.<br>
7<br>
You cried to me in trouble, and I saved you;<br>
I answered out of the thundercloud<br>
and tested your faith when there was no water at Meribah.<br>
-- Interlude<br>
8<br>
"Listen to me, O my people, whilst I give you stern warnings.<br>
O Israel, if you would only listen to me!<br>
9<br>
You must never have a foreign god;<br>
you must not bow down before a false god.<br>
10<br>
For it was I, the Lord your God,<br>
who rescued you from the land of Egypt.<br>
Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it with good things.<br>
11<br>
"But no, my people wouldn't listen.<br>
Israel did not want me around.<br>
12<br>
So I let them follow their own stubborn desires,<br>
living according to their own ideas.<br>
13<br>
Oh, that my people would listen to me!<br>
Oh, that Israel would follow me, walking in my paths!<br>
14<br>
How quickly I would then subdue their enemies!<br>
How soon my hands would be upon their foes!<br>
15<br>
Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him;<br>
they would be doomed forever.<br>
16<br>
But I would feed you with the finest wheat.<br>
I would satisfy you with wild honey from the rock."<br>

Let's turn now to 1 Corinthians 13, verse 12, in the KJV.<br>
We will start here, at 1 Corinthians 13, verse 12, and then we will continue reading into the next chapter, 1 Corinthians 14, down through verse 33.<br>
<br>
KJV<br>
12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.<br>
13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.<br>
1 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.<br>
2 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.<br>
3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.<br>
4 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.<br>
5 I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.<br>
6 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?<br>
7 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?<br>
8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?<br>
9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.<br>
10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.<br>
11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.<br>
12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.<br>
13 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.<br>
14 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.<br>
15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.<br>
16 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?<br>
17 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.<br>
18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:<br>
19 Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.<br>
20 Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.<br>
21 In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.<br>
22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.<br>
23 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?<br>
24 But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:<br>
25 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.<br>
26 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.<br>
27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.<br>
28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.<br>
29 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.<br>
30 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.<br>
31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.<br>
32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.<br>
33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.<br>
<br>
Looking at this again in the NLT...<br>
We start now in 1 Corinthians 13, verse 12.<br>
We will read these last two verses of 1 Corinthians 13, and then we will keep on reading right into 1 Corinthians 14, and go all the way down to verse 33.<br>
<br>
NLT<br>
(Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see face to face.)<br>
12 Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity. All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything completely, just as God now knows me completely.<br>
<br>
<br>
13 Three things will last forever -- faith, hope, and love -- and the greatest of these is love.<br>
1 Let love be your highest goal! But you should also desire the special abilities the Spirit gives -- especially the ability to prophesy.<br>
<br>
(For if you have the ability to speak in unknown languages, you will be talking only to God, since people won't be able to understand you. You will be speaking in your spirit, but it will all be mysterious.)<br>
2 For if you have the ability to speak in tongues, you will be talking only to God, since people won't be able to understand you. You will be speaking by the power of the Spirit, but it will all be mysterious.<br>
3 But one who prophesies strengthens others, encourages them, and comforts them.<br>
4 A person who speaks in tongues is strengthened personally, but one who speaks a word of prophecy strengthens the entire church.<br>
5 I wish you could all speak in tongues, but even more I wish you could all prophesy. For prophecy is greater than speaking in tongues, unless someone interprets what you are saying so that the whole church will be strengthened.<br>
<br>
(Dear brothers, if I should come to you speaking in tongues, how would that help you?)<br>
6 Dear brothers and sisters, if I should come to you speaking in an unknown language, how would that help you? But if I bring you a revelation or some special knowledge or prophecy or teaching, that will be helpful.<br>
7 Even lifeless instruments like the flute or the harp must play the notes clearly, or no one will recognise the melody.<br>
8 And if the bugler doesn't sound a clear call, how will the soldiers know they are being called to battle?<br>
9 It's the same for you. If you speak to people in words they don't understand, how will they know what you are saying? You might as well be talking into empty space.<br>
10 There are many different languages in the world, and every language has meaning.<br>
11 But if I don't understand a language, I will be a foreigner to someone who speaks it, and the one who speaks it will be a foreigner to me.<br>
12 And the same is true for you. Since you are so eager to have the special abilities the Spirit gives, seek those that will strengthen the whole church.<br>
13 So anyone who speaks in tongues should pray also for the ability to interpret what has been said.<br>
14 For if I pray in tongues, my spirit is praying, but I don't understand what I am saying.<br>
<br>
(Well then, what shall I do? I will pray in the Spirit, and I will also pray in words I understand.)<br>
15 Well then, what shall I do? I will pray in the spirit, and I will also pray in words I understand. I will sing in the spirit, and I will also sing in words I understand.<br>
16 For if you praise God only in the spirit, how can those who don't understand you praise God along with you? How can they join you in giving thanks when they don't understand what you are saying?<br>
17 You will be giving thanks very well, but it won't strengthen the people who hear you.<br>
18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you.<br>
19 But in a church meeting I would rather speak five understandable words to help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language.<br>
20 Dear brothers and sisters, don't be childish in your understanding of these things. Be innocent as babies when it comes to evil, but be mature in understanding matters of this kind.<br>
<br>
<br>
21<br>
(It is written in the law.)<br>
It is written in the Scriptures:<br>
"I will speak to my own people<br>
through strange languages<br>
and through the lips of foreigners.<br>
But even then, they will not listen to me,"<br>
says the Lord.<br>
<br>
(That is quoting from Isa 28: 11-12.)<br>
<br>
<br>
22 So you see that speaking in tongues is a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is for the benefit of believers, not unbelievers.<br>
23 Even so, if unbelievers or people who don't understand these things come into your church meeting and hear everyone speaking in an unknown language, they will think you are crazy.<br>
24 But if all of you are prophesying, and unbelievers or people who don't understand these things come into your meeting, they will be convicted of sin and judged by what you say.<br>
25 As they listen, their secret thoughts will be exposed, and they will fall to their knees and worship God, declaring, "God is truly here amongst you."<br>
26 Well, my brothers and sisters, let's summarise. When you meet together, one will sing, another will teach, another will tell some special revelation God has given, one will speak in tongues, and another will interpret what is said. But everything that is done must strengthen all of you.<br>
27 No more than two or three should speak in tongues. They must speak one at a time, and someone must interpret what they say.<br>
28 But if no one is present who can interpret, they must be silent in your church meeting and speak in tongues to God privately.<br>
29 Let two or three people prophesy, and let the others evaluate what is said.<br>
30 But if someone is prophesying and another person receives a revelation from the Lord, the one who is speaking must stop.<br>
31 In this way, all who prophesy will have a turn to speak, one after the other, so that everyone will learn and be encouraged.<br>
32 Remember that people who prophesy are in control of their spirit and can take turns.<br>
(For God is not a God of disorder but of peace.)<br>
33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the meetings of God's holy people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Studying the Hebrew language is very important for doing deeper Bible studies.<br>
But, if you are speaking the Hebrew language, and your audience does not know the Hebrew language, then it is an unknown language to them, with noises and sounds that do not make any sense to your audience.<br>
If you go back and read all of this again, imagine the Hebrew language being the unknown language, or the unknown tongue.<br>
We are called to study the Bible, to study ourselves to be approved unto God.<br>
Yet we are also called to preach the Gospel and deliver the Good News to those that do not know Jesus very well, or even to those who are not yet saved and do not know Jesus at all, and do not yet have any relationship with Him.<br>
Last week, you prayed, and you studied your Bible last week. Maybe, you even did those things every day last week.<br>
That is good. Keep doing that every day.<br>
How many people did you preach the Gospel to last week?  How many people did you help get saved last week?<br>
Think carefully about the content you are delivering to your audience, being sensitive to those that don't know Jesus and the Bible as well as you do.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3:15 (KJV)<br>
...be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you...<br>
NLT:<br>
...if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it.<br>
<br>
Unknown languages, not known to your audience, and not providing any interpretation or meaning, can cause your audience to lose interest in your message, as well as them losing interest in developing and strengthening their relationship with Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
This reminds me of something that we saw a long time ago, when we did our Bible Study, The Doer, back on Christian Essays 2.<br>
<br>
James 1:26 KJV<br>
26 If any man amongst you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br>
<br>
James 1:26 NLT<br>
26 If you claim to be religious but don't control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless. <br>

17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:<br>
18 Lest the Lord see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.<br>

Proverbs 24: 17 & 18 NLT<br>
17<br>
Don't rejoice when your enemies fall;<br>
don't be happy when they stumble.<br>

For the Lord will be displeased with you<br>
and will turn his anger away from them.<br>

Colossians 3: 9-17<br>
KJV<br>
9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;<br>
10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:<br>
11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.<br>
12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;<br>
13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.<br>
14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.<br>
15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.<br>
16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.<br>
17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.<br>
<br>

<br>

Colossians 3: 9-17<br>
9 Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices<br>
10 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.<br>
11 Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.<br>
12 Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.<br>
13 Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.<br>
14 And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.<br>
15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.<br>
16 Let the message of Christ dwell amongst you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.<br>
17 And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 3: 7-17<br>
NLT<br>
7 You used to do these things when your life was still part of this world.<br>
8 But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behaviour, slander, and dirty language.<br>
9 Don't lie to each other, for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its wicked deeds.<br>
10 Put on your new nature, and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him.<br>
11 In this new life, it doesn't matter if you are (a Greek,) a Jew or a Gentile, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbaric, uncivilised, (Barbarian,) Scythian, slave, or free. Christ is all that matters, and he lives in all of us.<br>
12 Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.<br>
13 Make allowance for each other's faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.<br>
14 Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony.<br>
15 And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body you are called to live in peace. And always be thankful.<br>
16 Let the message about Christ, in all its richness, fill your lives. Teach and counsel each other with all the wisdom he gives. Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful hearts.<br>
17 And whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through him to God the Father.<br>
<br>
<br>
This reminds me of something in the Old Testament.<br>
Let's focus on one particular detail found in the set of instructions on how to do the Dedication of the Priests.<br>
Exodus 29: Verse 1, then verses 29 and 30<br>
KJV<br>
1 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office....<br>
29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.<br>
30 And (he of his sons,) that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.<br>
<br>
Exodus 29: Verse 1, then verses 29 and 30, NLT<br>
NLT<br>
1 "This is the ceremony you must follow when you consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests....<br>
29 "Aaron's sacred garments must be preserved for his descendants who succeed him, and they will wear them when they are anointed and ordained. <br>
30 The descendant who succeeds him as high priest will wear these clothes for seven days as he ministers in the Tabernacle and the Holy Place.<br>
<br>
Exodus 29:30 -- NLT, First Edition<br>
30 Whoever is the next high priest after Aaron will wear these clothes for seven days before beginning to minister in the Tabernacle and the Holy Place.<br>
<br>
Commentary: This part in the NLT, First Edition, was not quite as accurate and was changed in later editions.<br>
Nevertheless, the First Edition did present an interesting perspective.

I'm remembering a little random verse right now that was in the NLT, first edition,<br>
and then a part of it disappeared by the time we look at the fifth edition of the NLT.<br>
Galatians 5:19-21 (NLT, First Edition)<br>
19 When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, your lives will produce these evil results: sexual immorality, impure thoughts, eagerness for lustful pleasure,<br>
20 idolatry, participation in demonic activities, hostility, quarrelling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, divisions, the feeling that everyone is wrong except those in your own little group,<br>
21 envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other kinds of sin. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
If we jump to the NLT, 5th Edition, notice how verse 20 changes.<br>
Galatians 5:19-21 (NLT, Fifth Edition)<br>
19 When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures,<br>
20 idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarrelling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division,<br>
21 envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 23: 8-14 KJV<br>
8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.<br>
9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.<br>
10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.<br>
11 But he that is greatest amongst you shall be your servant.<br>
12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.<br>
13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.<br>
14 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 23: 8-14 NLT<br>
8 "Don't let anyone call you 'Rabbi,' for you have only one teacher, and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters.<br>
9 And don't address anyone here on earth as 'Father,' for only God in heaven is your Father.<br>
10 And don't let anyone call you 'Teacher,' for you have only one teacher, the Messiah.<br>
11 The greatest amongst you must be a servant.<br>
12 But those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.<br>
13 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you shut the door of the Kingdom of Heaven in people's faces. You won't go in yourselves, and you don't let others enter either.<br>
14 What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! You shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, you will be severely punished.<br>
<br>
<br>
This teaching from Jesus about the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees who cheat widows out of their property is also mentioned in Mark 12:40 and Luke 20:47.<br>

In the following prayer, the Hebrew words are being spelled with English letters in such a way as to pronounce and say them correctly, with the same sound and utterance of speaking the name in the Original Hebrew.<br>

Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given amongst men, whereby we must be saved.<br>

Acts 4: 9-12 NLT<br>
Do you want to know how he was healed?<br>
10 Let me clearly state to all of you and to all the people of Israel that he was healed by the powerful name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene (of Nazareth), the man you crucified but whom God raised from the dead.<br>
11 For Jesus is the one referred to in the Scriptures, where it says (in Psalms 118:22)<br>
'The stone that you builders rejected<br>
has now become the cornerstone.'<br>
12 There is salvation in no one else! God has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved."<br>

Let us take this moment to pray.<br>
<br>
Our Father in heaven, our dear heavenly Father, Messiah, almighty, Holy God, Lord Jesus Christ, I call on the Name of the Lord, the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the only true, wise God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of Israel. Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord God almighty, the one who was, and is, and is to come. Enter into my heart, my mind, and soul right now, enter into me, and baptise me and saturate me now with the Spirit of the Lord, the Presence of the Lord, the Glory of the Lord, the beauty of the Lord, the Joy of the Lord, baptise us in the Holy Spirit now, and fill us now with the Holy Spirit, and your love, your salvation, your deliverance and your forgiveness. Strengthen us now, heal us, bless us and protect us. Protects us and deliver us from all temptation and from all evil. Set us free from all addictions and enslavements. Set free those of us who are being held captive and are physically or spiritually imprisoned. Open our eyes so that we may see. Heal and fix our broken heart, create and put into us whatever is lacking or missing, and cast out of us that which does not belong.<br>
<br>
Lord Jesus, I need you, and the people in my life that I love need you now. Help us, save us now, and deliver us from all of our doubts, our unbelief, our burdens, troubles, trials, tribulations, persecutions, sufferings, afflictions, inadequacies, my weaknesses and limitations, my murmurings, fears, worries, anxieties, complaints, injustices, our sins, our poverty, attitudes, emotions, imaginations, memories, and heal and help our relationships with each other, and bless our relationship that we each have with you. Cause all our sin to go into remission. Help us not look back, and help us run and do what you have set before us, with patience.<br>
<br>
Take my list of what I think is good and evil, right and wrong, and change my list so that it matches your list of what you say is good and evil, what you say is right and wrong, what you say is valuable or worthless, what you say is important or not important. May my daily list of priorities, my daily list of things to do be based on your list, Lord God almighty.<br>
<br>
Bless our belief in you, help us rest in you, help us keep our eyes fixed on you, help us keep our ears listening to you, the voice of truth, help us delight in you, forgive us, for we know not what we do. May your name be kept holy, honoured and respected. Help us study the Scriptures and keep your word, and help us be doers of the word of God, help us fear the Lord, follow you, Lord and obey you Lord, help us obey your Torah, your commandments, and help us keep the Sabbaths, and help us keep the feasts. Bless our ability to praise and worship only you, God our Father. Guide us into all truth. Within ourselves, and in our circumstances, take all that is wrong and make it right.<br>
<br>
Fix, edit and correct us, and put into us the desires that we should have in our hearts.<br>
<br>
Bless our faith, give us your encouragement, bless our ability to trust in you, and help us put our confidence only in you, help us be of good courage, strengthen our hearts, and help us put and keep our hope in you, Almighty, Hold God, Messiah, Lord, Jesus Christ. All that we need, your hand has provided.  Bless our provision, help us be strong, be healed, help us love and forgive one another. Give us all that we need.  Show us how to provide for ourselves and our family.  Help us share and give your commandments, all of your Bible teachings, and your word to others. Help me read through the entire Bible, and pray, every single day.   Give us strength, healing, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, revelation, discernment, and direction. Be our good Shepard, be our good counsellor, and pilot us and direct us through each day, as we go from second to second, from place to place, from task to task, and from person to person, and from thought to thought.  We need your mercy and your grace right now and every day. Help us be a neighbour, help us obey the greatest commandments.  Put into us, the Love is list, the Fruit of the Spirit list, help us think only on the whatsoever-is list, and cast out of us the items in the Put Away list. Thank you for saving me, and preparing for me a place to live forever in your kingdom, with you.<br>
<br>
We believe that Jesus is Lord, that Jesus Christ and God are one and the same.  We believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, that Jesus was buried, and, on the third day, God raised Jesus up from the grave, and that the resurrected Jesus was seen by many hundreds of witnesses.<br>
<br>
Lord Jesus, be our greatest encourager.  We believe that, because of your love and faithfulness, you will never stop doing good for us. Bless us, keep us, give us your wisdom, mercy and grace, and give us peace. We pray for these things in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy ghost, in the name of our deliverer, our saviour and Lord Jesus Christ, Amen, amen, so be it, let it become true. Hallelujah!<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
Roots Before Fruits<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Get Rooted in the Word of God so that you can produce the Fruit of The Spirit.<br>
You can't grow good fruits until you first grow good roots.<br>
Go deeper, and get deeply rooted in the Word of God.<br>
What are the things that can help you go deeper, and what things could stop or block your ability to go deeper?<br>
Jesus is going to give us some insight on this, and help us answer this question. Again, the question is...<br>
What are the things that can help you go deeper, and what things could stop or block your ability to go deeper?<br>
If the devil can't make you bad, he'll make you busy; too busy to spend time studying the Bible, the Torah, the Word of God.<br>
We also did a Bible Study awhile ago, titled, Going Deeper (in Christian Essays 6).<br>
That is another interesting look at going deeper, there in Ezekiel 47.<br>
Take what we learnt there in Ezekiel 47 and add to it the content presented here.<br>
Jesus is going to tell us the situations, circumstances and soil conditions that help us go deeper into our relationship with Him, as well as the things that can hinder or weaken our walk with Him.<br>
It's hard for the seed to go into the soil, unless the soil is in a state of brokenness.<br>
Are you broke?  Are you broken?  The Lord can use that.<br>
Broken soil and a broken heart? Yes. Hardened soil and a hardened heart? No, or at least not yet.<br>
When people walk all over you, the soil, the path that they make from walking on that same area of ground, becomes hardened, and the seed can't take root in packed down soil that people have been walking all over.<br>
Don't let your past, and the sinners of your past, the people of your past, stop the seed from taking root in your mind and in your heart.<br>
Let Jesus enter into you right now, today and every day. Pray that He will, right now, today, and every day.<br>
Hear the word of the Lord, and receive it.  Let it enter into you. Do not question it or criticise it because you don't like it or do not understand it.<br>
Hear the word, and receive it, and you will start to grow roots, so that you can produce the Fruit of the Spirit.<br>
Bloom where you're planted.<br>
Also, consider Galatians 6:2, which is the verse that says,<br>
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.<br>
Let's begin by going into the book of Galatians, starting in chapter 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians from 5:22 and continuing to 6:10 (KJV)<br>
22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,<br>
23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.<br>
24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.<br>
25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.<br>
26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.<br>
1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.<br>
2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.<br>
3 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.<br>
4 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.<br>
5 For every man shall bear his own burden.<br>
6 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.<br>
7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.<br>
8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.<br>
9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.<br>
10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians from 5:22 to 6:10 NLT:<br>
22 But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<br>
23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!<br>
24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there.<br>
25 Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit's leading in every part of our lives.<br>
26 Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another.<br>
1 Dear brothers and sisters, (if a man,) if another believer is overcome by some sin, you who are godly (you who are spiritual) should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path. And be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself.<br>
2 Share each other's burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ.<br>
3 If you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself. You are not that important.<br>
4 Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won't need to compare yourself to anyone else.<br>
5 For we are each responsible for our own conduct.<br>
6 Those who are taught the word of God should provide for their teachers, sharing all good things with them.<br>
7 Don't be misled -- you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant.<br>
8 Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit.<br>
9 So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.<br>
10 Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do good to everyone -- especially to those in the family of faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
A parable of Jesus Christ:<br>
<br>
Mark 4:1-23 (KJV)<br>
1 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.<br>
2 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,<br>
3 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:<br>
4 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.<br>
5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:<br>
6 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.<br>
7 And some fell amongst thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.<br>
8 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.<br>
9 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.<br>
10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.<br>
11 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:<br>
12 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.<br>
13 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?<br>
14 The sower soweth the word.<br>
15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.<br>
16 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;<br>
17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.<br>
18 And these are they which are sown amongst thorns; such as hear the word,<br>
19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.<br>
20 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.<br>
21 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?<br>
22 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.<br>
23 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4:1-25 NLT<br>
1 Once again Jesus began teaching by the lakeshore. A very large crowd soon gathered around him, so he got into a boat. Then he sat in the boat while all the people remained on the shore.<br>
2 He taught them by telling many stories in the form of parables, such as this one:<br>
3 "Listen! A farmer went out to plant some seed.<br>
4 As he scattered it across his field, some of the seed fell on a footpath, and the birds came and ate it.<br>
5 Other seed fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seed sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.<br>
6 But the plant soon wilted under the hot sun, and since it didn't have deep roots, it died.<br>
7 Other seed fell amongst thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants so they produced no grain.<br>
8 Still other seeds fell on fertile soil, and they sprouted, grew, and produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!"<br>
9 Then he said, "Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand."<br>
10 Later, when Jesus was alone with the twelve disciples and with the others who were gathered around, they asked him what the parables meant.<br>
11 He replied, "You are permitted to understand the secret of the Kingdom of God (the mystery of the Kingdom of God). But I use parables for everything I say to outsiders,<br>
12 so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled:<br>
'When they see what I do,<br>
they will learn nothing.<br>
When they hear what I say,<br>
they will not understand.<br>
Otherwise, they will turn to me<br>
and be forgiven.' (Jesus is quoting from the book of Isaiah 6: verses 9 and 10, Greek version.)"<br>
13 Then Jesus said to them, "If you can't understand the meaning of this parable, how will you understand all the other parables?<br>
14 The farmer plants seed by taking God's word to others.<br>
15 The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message, only to have Satan come at once and take it away.<br>
16 The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.<br>
17 But since they don't have deep roots, they don't last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God's word.<br>
18 The seed that fell amongst the thorns represents others who hear God's word,<br>
19 but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life, the lure of wealth, and the desire for other things, so no fruit is produced.<br>
20 And the seed that fell on good soil represents those who hear and accept God's word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!"<br>
21 Then Jesus asked them, "Would anyone light a lamp and then put it under a basket or under a bed? Of course not! A lamp is placed on a stand, where its light will shine.<br>
22 For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.<br>
23 Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand."<br>
24 Then he added, "Pay close attention to what you hear. The closer you listen, the more understanding you will be given (The measure you give will be the measure you get back.) -- and you will receive even more.<br>
25 To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening, even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them."<br>

In the north-central United States, in the Midwest and Great Lakes region, is the small city of Sparta, Wisconsin.<br>
In this area is where we find Matt and Sherry McPherson.<br>
They are Christian business owners, songwriters, worship leaders and recording artists.<br>
<br>
Here is a very short and famous poem by Matt and Sherry McPherson.<br>
It is sang at the end of every recent TV episode of Superbook.<br>
First released in 2004, the name of this poem is, The Salvation Poem:<br>
<br>
Jesus, You died upon a cross<br>
And rose again to save the lost<br>
Forgive me now of all my sin<br>
Come be my Saviour, Lord, and Friend<br>
Change my life and make it new<br>
And help me, Lord, to live for You<br>

Isaiah chapters 52 and 53 are estimated to have been written about 681 years before Jesus Christ was born.<br>
This is talking about something that was going to happen about 714 years into the future, and it all happened exactly as described here!<br>
<br>
<br>
(Additional Hebrew meanings, and meanings from the Old Testament Greek version, and/or Syriac version, are included here, in round brackets.)<br>
<br>
Isaiah 52:13, reading to the end of chapter 52, at verse 15,<br>
and then continuing as we read into all of Isaiah 53.<br>
KJV<br>
(Behold, my servant shall prosper prudently,)<br>
13 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.<br>
<br>
<br>
14 As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:<br>
15 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.<br>
<br>
(Who hath believed our doctrine?)<br>
(Who hath believed our hearing?)<br>
1 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?<br>
<br>
<br>
2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.<br>
<br>
<br>
3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: <br>
(and he hid as it were his face from us; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.)<br>
(and we hid as an hiding of faces from him)<br>
(and he hid as an hiding of faces from us)<br>
and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<br>
<br>
<br>
4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.<br>
<br>
(But he was tormented for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his bruise we are healed.)<br>
5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.<br>
<br>
<br>
6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; <br>
(and the Lord hath made the iniquity of us all to meet on him,)<br>
and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.<br>
<br>
<br>
7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.<br>
<br>
(He was taken away by distress and judgement: but, who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was the stroke upon him.)<br>
8 He was taken from prison and from judgement: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 And he made his grave with the wicked, (and with the rich in his deaths,) and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.<br>
<br>
<br>
10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: <br>
(when his soul shall make an offering for sin,)<br>
when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.<br>
12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 52:13, reading to the end of chapter 52, at verse 15,<br>
and then continuing as we read into all of Isaiah 53.<br>
NLT<br>
13<br>
See, my servant will prosper;<br>
he will be highly exalted.<br>
14<br>
(But many were amazed when they saw you.)<br>
But many were amazed when they saw him.<br>
<br>
His face was so disfigured he seemed hardly human,<br>
and from his appearance, one would scarcely know he was a man.<br>
15<br>
(And he will cleanse many nations.)<br>
And he will startle many nations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kings will stand speechless in his presence.<br>
For they will see what they had not been told;<br>
<br>
<br>
they will understand what they had not heard about.<br>
(Those who have never been told about him will see, and those who have never heard of him will understand.)<br>
<br>
1<br>
Who has believed our message?<br>
To whom has the Lord revealed his powerful arm?<br>
2<br>
My servant grew up in the Lord's presence like a tender green shoot,<br>
like a root in dry ground.<br>
There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance,<br>
nothing to attract us to him.<br>
3<br>
He was despised and rejected--<br>
a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief.<br>
We turned our backs on him and looked the other way.<br>
He was despised, and we did not care.<br>
4<br>
Yet it was our weaknesses he carried;<br>
it was our sorrows that weighed him down.<br>
(Yet it was our sicknesses he carried; it was our diseases that weighed him down.)<br>
<br>
And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God,<br>
a punishment for his own sins!<br>
5<br>
But he was pierced for our rebellion,<br>
crushed for our sins.<br>
He was beaten so we could be whole.<br>
He was whipped so we could be healed.<br>
6<br>
All of us, like sheep, have strayed away.<br>
We have left God's paths to follow our own.<br>
Yet the Lord laid on him<br>
the sins of us all.<br>
7<br>
He was oppressed and treated harshly,<br>
yet he never said a word.<br>
He was led like a lamb to the slaughter.<br>
And as a sheep is silent before the shearers,<br>
he did not open his mouth.<br>
8<br>
Unjustly condemned, he was led away.<br>
(He was humiliated and received no justice.)<br>
<br>
(As for his contemporaries, who cared that his life was cut short in midstream?)<br>
(Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.)<br>
No one cared that he died without descendants, that his life was cut short in midstream.<br>
<br>
<br>
But he was struck down<br>
for the rebellion of my people.<br>
9<br>
He had done no wrong<br>
and had never deceived anyone.<br>
But he was buried like a criminal;<br>
he was put in a rich man’s grave.<br>
10<br>
But it was the Lord's good plan to crush him<br>
and cause him grief.<br>
Yet when his life is made an offering for sin,<br>
he will have many descendants.<br>
He will enjoy a long life,<br>
and the Lord's good plan will prosper in his hands.<br>
11<br>
When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish,<br>
he will be satisfied.<br>
And because of his experience,<br>
my righteous servant will make it possible<br>
for many to be counted righteous,<br>
for he will bear all their sins.<br>
12<br>
I will give him the honours of a victorious soldier,<br>
because he exposed himself to death.<br>
He was counted amongst the rebels.<br>
He bore the sins of many and interceded for rebels.<br>
<br>
<br>
This next spot, Isaiah 52:15 Greek version, is in Romans 15, after Paul teaches about Living to Please Others, Paul talks about his Reason for Writing, where he says...<br>
Romans 15:21<br>
KJV<br>
21 But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.<br>
<br>
Romans 15:21<br>
NLT<br>
21<br>
I have been following the plan spoken of in the Scriptures, where it says,<br>
"Those who have never been told about him will see,<br>
and those who have never heard of him will understand."<br>
(Quoting from Isaiah 52:15 Greek version).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another place where we see a little bit of Isaiah 53 is in the story about Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch.<br>
(The Eunuch had been reading this spot right here, Isaiah 53:7-8 Greek version, just before Philip told the Ethiopian Eunuch about Jesus Christ and the Good News, then Philip baptised the Eunuch, and when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch never saw Philip again but went on his way rejoicing.)<br>
Acts 8:32 & 33<br>
KJV<br>
32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:<br>
33 In his humiliation his judgement was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 8:32 & 33<br>
NLT<br>
32<br>
The passage of Scripture that the Eunuch had been reading was this:<br>
"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter.<br>
And as a lamb is silent before the shearers,<br>
he did not open his mouth.<br>
33<br>
He was humiliated and received no justice.<br>
Who can speak of his descendants?<br>
For his life was taken from the earth."<br>
(Reading from Isaiah 53:7-8 Greek version).<br>

Does the Holy Spirit really guide us, pilot us, and direct us?<br>
Yes, He sure does.  Here's the proof...<br>
<br>
The book of Acts, the Acts of the Apostles, written by Luke. Chapter 16.<br>
<br>
Acts 16: 4-10 KJV<br>
4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.<br>
5 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.<br>
6 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,<br>
7 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.<br>
8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.<br>
9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.<br>
10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.<br>
<br>
(Phrygia, Galatia, Asia, Mysia, and Bithynia were all districts in what is now Turkey.)<br>
<br>
Acts 16: 4-10 NLT<br>
4 Then they went from town to town, instructing the believers to follow the decisions made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.<br>
5 So the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew larger every day.<br>
6 Next Paul and Silas travelled through the area of Phrygia and Galatia, because the Holy Spirit had prevented them from preaching the word in the province of Asia at that time.<br>
7 Then coming to the borders of Mysia, they headed north for the province of Bithynia, but again the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to go there.<br>
8 So instead, they went on through Mysia to the seaport of Troas.<br>
9 That night Paul had a vision: A man from Macedonia in northern Greece was standing there, pleading with him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us!"<br>
(Luke, the writer of this book, here joined Paul and accompanied him on his journey. So, Luke and Paul decided to leave for Macedonia at once.)<br>
10 So we decided to leave for Macedonia at once, having concluded that God was calling us to preach the Good News there.<br>

Here is another interesting Christian song<br>
that was quite popular many years ago.<br>
We'll take a look at just the lyrics to this song here in just a moment.<br>
Quite some time ago, we read the words to another one of their songs previously.<br>
So, here is another song to think about from the band, Sanctus Real.<br>
Sanctus Real is an American Christian rock band formed in Toledo, Ohio, in 1996.<br>
<br>
By 2015, Sanctus Real had released seven studio albums.<br>
<br>
The song we will look at next, is titled, Whatever You're Doing (Something Heavenly).<br>
This song comes from their fourth studio album, titled, We Need Each Other, which was recorded in 2007,<br>
and was released on 12 February 2008.<br>
The album's second single, "Whatever You're Doing (Something Heavenly)" started to get radio play towards the end of May 2008. The music video, recorded in May 2008, became popular in the early days of June 2008.<br>
<br>
Whatever You're Doing (Something Heavenly) has an album version,<br>
an acoustic version, and an instrumental version.<br>
The instrumental version is the exact same recording, except that the lead vocal track is omitted.<br>
The other background vocals are still in there, in the instrumental version.<br>
The instrumental version was released by Premiere Performance Plus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2008 song,<br>
Whatever You're Doing (Something Heavenly)<br>
by the band, Sanctus Real.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's time for healing<br>
time to move on<br>
It's time to fix what's been broken too long<br>
Time to make right<br>
what has been wrong<br>
It's time to find my way to where I belong<br>
There's a wave that's crashing over me<br>
and all I can do<br>
is surrender<br>
<br>
<br>
Whatever you're doing inside of me<br>
It feels like chaos, but somehow there's peace<br>
And it's hard to surrender<br>
to what I can't see,<br>
but I'm giving in<br>
to something heavenly<br>
<br>
Time for a milestone<br>
Time to begin again<br>
re-evaluate<br>
who I really am<br>
Am I doing everything to follow your will<br>
or just climbing aimlessly over these hills?<br>
So show me what it is you want from me<br>
I give everything -- I surrender...<br>
<br>
<br>
To whatever you're doing inside of me<br>
It feels like chaos, but somehow there's peace<br>
Though it's hard to surrender to what I can't see,<br>
I'm giving in to something heavenly,<br>
something heavenly<br>
<br>
<br>
Time to face up<br>
Clean this old house<br>
Time to breathe in<br>
and let everything out<br>
That I've wanted to say for so many years<br>
Time to release all my held back tears<br>
<br>
Whatever you're doing inside of me<br>
It feels like chaos, but I believe<br>
You're up to something bigger than me<br>
Larger than life, something heavenly<br>
<br>
Whatever you're doing inside of me<br>
It feels like chaos, but now I can see<br>
This is something bigger than me<br>
Larger than life<br>
Something heavenly,<br>
something heavenly<br>
<br>
<br>
Time to face up<br>
Clean this old house<br>
Time to breathe in<br>
and let<br>
everything<br>
out<br>
<br>
<br>

Commentary:  Let's think about all of these Bible verses, and bring them all together.  Jesus Christ is the rock on which we stand, the chief cornerstone, giving us a firm foundation.  He is the rock that followed the Israelites in the desert.  He is the rock that is in you and follows you in your own desert. They received the bread of life from Heaven, and water came out of the rock, the word of God became flesh and dwelt amongst them.  The word of God was the rock. Honey is also a picture of the word of God, because, when you study the word of God, when you let it enter into you, like eating and drinking lets things enter into you, you will taste and see that the Lord is Good, and the Word is sweet and enjoyable to take in. The word of God, the honey, came out of the Rock. Unfortunately, when people fill themselves up with something else other than the word of God, the honey, they are so filled up with other things that they do not want to take in the word of God, the honey, and so their hunger and thirst can never be truly satisfied by anything else, so they become so famished that, taking in bitter food tastes sweet to them.  And so, bitter becomes sweet to them, because they eat and drink everything else but the bread of life, and the living water. And so, what is wrong, is right to them, and what is bad, is good to them, and so, what the world says becomes the opposite of what the Bible says. The teachings of Christ are the opposite of the teachings of the world. Look at your TV, look at your computer and look at your phone. What are you feeding yourself every day? There is only one thing you can eat and drink that can truly satisfy and fulfil your heart, your mind, your soul and your life.  It's still not too late to change your diet to the bread of life and the living water, washing you in the water of the word. Try it. Taste and see that the Lord is good, sweeter than honey fresh from the honeycomb, helping you, saving you, washing you, forgiving and cleansing you from all sin. Replace the hell-y stuff with the healthy stuff. Start eating and drinking the healthy stuff by reading your entire Bible, all of it, and praying, every single day.<br>

26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.<br>
27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lamentations 3:19-27 NLT<br>
<br>
(The thought of my suffering and homelessness<br>
is wormwood and gall.)<br>
<br>
19<br>
The thought of my suffering and homelessness<br>
is bitter beyond words.<br>
20<br>
I will never forget this awful time,<br>
as I grieve over my loss.<br>
21<br>
Yet I still dare to hope<br>
when I remember this:<br>
<br>
<br>
(The faithful love of the Lord keeps us from destruction.)<br>
<br>
22<br>
The faithful love of the Lord never ends!<br>
His mercies never cease.<br>
23<br>
Great is his faithfulness;<br>
his mercies begin afresh each morning.<br>
24<br>
I say to myself, "The Lord is my inheritance;<br>
therefore, I will hope in him!"<br>
25<br>
The Lord is good to those who depend on him,<br>
to those who search for him.<br>
26<br>
So it is good to wait quietly<br>
for salvation from the Lord.<br>
27<br>
And it is good for people to submit at an early age<br>
to the yoke of his discipline:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 11: 29 & 30 -- KJV<br>
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<br>
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.<br>
