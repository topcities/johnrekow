<p>
<br>
The Lord Listens<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Quite some time ago, we did a Bible study here where we talked about the things that could hinder your prayers.<br>
There are some situations that could cause the Lord to not listen to your prayers, or have your prayers be hindered in some kind of way.<br>
<br>
One example is having unconfessed, un-dealt-with sin.<br>
Having or keeping sin in your heart and in your life could cause the Lord to not listen to or answer your prayers in the full and effective way that you would like.<br>
<br>
Here is a Bible verse that we looked at when we did that Bible study previously.<br>
Psalms 66:18.  Here are a few translations of that verse.<br>
KJV: If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.<br>
NIV: If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.<br>
NASB: (If I had regarded wickedness in my heart,)<br>
If I regard wickedness in my heart,<br>
The Lord will not hear.<br>
<br>
<br>
But now, it's time to see something beautiful in this Psalm!<br>
If we apply God's love, His mercy and grace, and we apply the blood of Jesus and His salvation, deliverance and forgiveness, watch what happens here in this Psalm!<br>
<br>
This is the exact same Psalm, Psalms 66, but this time we will start in<br>
Verse 16 and read to the end of the Psalm, which is verse 20.<br>
KJV:<br>
16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.<br>
17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.<br>
18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:<br>
19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.<br>
20 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.<br>
<br>
Psalms 66: 16-20 NLT<br>
16<br>
Come and listen, all you who fear God,<br>
and I will tell you what he did for me.<br>
17<br>
For I cried out to him for help,<br>
praising him as I spoke.<br>
18<br>
If I had not confessed the sin in my heart,<br>
the Lord would not have listened.<br>
19<br>
But God did listen!<br>
He paid attention to my prayer.<br>
20<br>
Praise God, who did not ignore my prayer<br>
or withdraw his unfailing love from me.<br>
<br>
NASB:<br>
16<br>
Come and hear, (all who revere God) all who fear God,<br>
And I will tell of what He has done for my soul.<br>
17<br>
I cried to Him with my mouth,<br>
And He was extolled with my tongue.<br>
18<br>
If I regard wickedness in my heart,<br>
(If I had regarded wickedness in my heart,)<br>
The Lord will not hear;<br>
19<br>
But certainly God has heard;<br>
He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.<br>
20<br>
Blessed be God,<br>
Who has not turned away my prayer<br>
Nor His lovingkindness from me.<br>
<br>
NIV:<br>
16<br>
Come and hear, all you who fear God;<br>
let me tell you what he has done for me.<br>
17<br>
I cried out to him with my mouth;<br>
his praise was on my tongue.<br>
18<br>
If I had cherished sin in my heart,<br>
the Lord would not have listened;<br>
19<br>
but God has surely listened<br>
and has heard my prayer.<br>
20<br>
Praise be to God,<br>
who has not rejected my prayer<br>
or withheld his love from me!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 1:9 KJV<br>
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. <br>

<br>
Here is something interesting to think about...<br>
We have looked at some of these verses before, and we look at some of these things again later on.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 48: 6-13 (KJV)<br>
6 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.<br>
7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.<br>
8 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.<br>
9 For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.<br>
(Behold, I have refined thee, but not for silver.)<br>
10 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.<br>
11 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.<br>
12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.<br>
13 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, (and the palm of my right hand hath spread out the heavens,) and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 48: 6-13 (NLT)<br>
6<br>
You have heard my predictions and seen them fulfilled,<br>
but you refuse to admit it.<br>
Now I will tell you new things,<br>
secrets you have not yet heard.<br>
7<br>
They are brand new, not things from the past.<br>
So you cannot say, 'We knew that all the time!'<br>
8<br>
"Yes, I will tell you of things that are entirely new,<br>
things you never heard of before.<br>
For I know so well what traitors you are.<br>
You have been rebels from birth.<br>
9<br>
Yet for my own sake and for the honour of my name,<br>
I will hold back my anger and not wipe you out.<br>
10<br>
I have refined you, but not as silver is refined.<br>
Rather, I have refined you in the furnace of suffering.<br>
11<br>
I will rescue you for my sake -- <br>
yes, for my own sake!<br>
I will not let my reputation be tarnished,<br>
and I will not share my glory with idols!<br>
12<br>
"Listen to me, O family of Jacob,<br>
Israel my chosen one!<br>
I alone am God,<br>
the First and the Last.<br>
13<br>
It was my hand that laid the foundations of the earth,<br>
my right hand that spread out the heavens above.<br>
When I call out the stars,<br>
they all appear in order."<br>
<br>

Before we move on to the next topic, let's look at a song that does a good job of praising the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Darin McWatters wrote a song titled, I'm Sustained.<br>
<br>
It was recorded and made popular by Danny Donnelly when Danny Donnelly released his album, Solo Worship, in 2003.<br>
<br>
Here are the lyrics to, I'm Sustained, as it was performed by Danny Donnelly, and written by Darin McWatters.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm satisfied by Your love so completely<br>
How could I thirst for the praises of man<br>
There's nothing I need that You haven't provided<br>
No one could offer me peace like You can<br>
<br>
Jesus Your love is enough, sufficient for me, all I have needed<br>
You've given for free, Your love is enough<br>
I don't need man's applause, I know what I'm worth, I remember the cross<br>
<br>
I'm sustained oh Lord, when Your light surrounds me the world goes away<br>
I'm sustained oh Lord, my heart knows Your love like it flows through my veins<br>
Such peace and contentment I found in Your grace<br>
I can't think why I'd ever complain<br>
You love me what more could I want, I'm sustained<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<a name="JAH7LIFEDEATHINTUNG"></a><h2>Controlling the Tongue</h2>
<p>
<br>
Controlling the Tongue<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 3: 10-18 KJV<br>
10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<br>
11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.<br>
12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br>
13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:<br>
14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:<br>
15 Their feet are swift to shed blood:<br>
16 Destruction and misery are in their ways:<br>
17 And the way of peace have they not known:<br>
18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.<br>
<br>
Romans 3: 9-18 NLT<br>
...all people, whether Jews, or Greeks or Gentiles, are under the power of sin. <br>
10<br>
(looking at the Greek versions of Psalms 14:1-3; and Psalms 53:1-3)<br>
As the Scriptures say,<br>
"No one is righteous -- <br>
not even one.<br>
11<br>
No one is truly wise;<br>
no one is seeking God.<br>
12<br>
All have turned away;<br>
all have become useless.<br>
No one does good,<br>
not a single one."<br>
(Next, we look at the Greek version of Psalms 5:9, and then the Hebrew version of Psalms 140:3...)<br>
13<br>
"Their talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave.<br>
Their tongues are filled with lies."<br>
"Snake venom drips from their lips."<br>
(In the Greek Version of Psalms 10:7, it says...)<br>
14<br>
"Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."<br>
(In Isa 59:7-8, it says,)<br>
15<br>
"They rush to commit murder.<br>
16<br>
Destruction and misery always follow them.<br>
17<br>
They don't know where to find peace."<br>
(and, the last verse here, verse 18, is quoting from Psalms 36:1...)<br>
18<br>
"They have no fear of God at all."<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, we will turn again to the end of Ephesians 4 and keep on reading into Ephesians, chapter 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
This also includes the Put-Away List, which was mentioned in Bonus 4, which was part of the list of the Most Popular Bible Verses, on the Parallel Bible page.<br>
<br>
Again we will begin at Ephesians 4:25 and continue reading into the next chapter until we get to Ephesians 5, verse 13.<br>
KJV<br>
25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.<br>
26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:<br>
27 Neither give place to the devil.<br>
28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.<br>
29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.<br>
30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.<br>
31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:<br>
32 And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.<br>
1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;<br>
2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<br>
3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named amongst you, as becometh saints;<br>
4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.<br>
5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<br>
6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.<br>
7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.<br>
8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:<br>
9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)<br>
10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.<br>
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.<br>
12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.<br>
13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4 and 5, this time in the NLT<br>
Starting at the end of Ephesians 4, verse 22 and then we will keep on reading into Ephesians, chapter 5, verse 14.<br>
NLT<br>
22 throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception. <br>
23 Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. <br>
24 Put on your new nature, created to be like God -- truly righteous and holy.<br>
25 So stop telling lies. Let us tell our neighbours the truth, for we are all parts of the same body. <br>
26 And "don't sin by letting anger control you." (referring to Psalms 4:4.) Don't let the sun go down whilst you are still angry, <br>
27 for anger gives a foothold to the devil.<br>
28 If you are a thief, quit stealing. Instead, use your hands for good hard work, and then give generously to others in need. <br>
29 Don't use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.<br>
30 And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own, (He has put his seal on you,) guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.<br>
31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behaviour. <br>
32 Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.<br>
1 Imitate God, therefore, in everything you do, because you are his dear children. <br>
2 Live a life filled with love, following the example of Christ. He loved us (and He loved you,) and offered himself as a sacrifice for us, a pleasing aroma to God.<br>
3 Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed amongst you. Such sins have no place among God's people. <br>
4 Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes -- these are not for you. Instead, let there be thankfulness to God. <br>
5 You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.<br>
6 Don't be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of God will fall on all who disobey him. <br>
7 Don't participate in the things these people do. <br>
8 For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light! <br>
9 For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true.<br>
10 Carefully determine what pleases the Lord. <br>
11 Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them. <br>
12 It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret. <br>
13 But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them, <br>
14 for the light makes everything visible....<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  That was in Ephesians, chapters 4 and 5. Next, we will turn to the book of James, chapter 3. All of James 3 is important. There are many Bible verses that talk about being careful with what you choose to say.<br>
You should listen first, and choose carefully what to say, Controlling the Tongue.<br>
The many samples of Scripture that we read in these Bible Studies are no substitution for reading your entire Bible, all books, all chapters, from cover to cover, every day.<br>
Why settle for these little samples, when you can dine on a full, complete meal?<br>
Nevertheless, here in James 3 is yet again another important reminder about being careful about the words we speak, and that True Wisdom Comes from God.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 3 KJV<br>
1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.<br>
2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.<br>
3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.<br>
4 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.<br>
5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!<br>
6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue amongst our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.<br>
7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:<br>
8 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.<br>
9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.<br>
10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.<br>
11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?<br>
12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.<br>
13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge amongst you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.<br>
14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.<br>
15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.<br>
16 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.<br>
17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.<br>
18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.<br>
<br>
James 3 NLT<br>
1 Dear brothers and sisters, not many of you should become teachers in the church, for we who teach will be judged more strictly. <br>
2 Indeed, we all make many mistakes. For if we could control our tongues, we would be perfect and could also control ourselves in every other way.<br>
3 We can make a large horse go wherever we want by means of a small bit in its mouth. <br>
4 And a small rudder makes a huge ship turn wherever the pilot chooses to go, even though the winds are strong. <br>
5 In the same way, the tongue is a small thing that makes grand speeches. But a tiny spark can set a great forest on fire. <br>
6 And amongst all the parts of the body, the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of wickedness, corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, (for it will burn in hell,) for it is set on fire by hell itself. (The Greek word for hell, right here is, Gehenna, which is a lake of fire).<br>
7 People can tame all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and fish, <br>
8 but no one can tame the tongue. It is restless and evil, full of deadly poison. <br>
9 Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father, and sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God. <br>
10 And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth. Surely, my brothers and sisters, this is not right! <br>
11 Does a spring of water bubble out with both fresh water and bitter water? <br>
12 Does a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? (No. You can't draw fresh water from salt.)<br>
No, and you can't draw fresh water from a salty spring.<br>
13 If you are wise and understand God's ways, prove it by living an honourable life, doing good works with the humility that comes from wisdom. <br>
14 But if you are bitterly jealous and there is selfish ambition in your heart, don't cover up the truth with boasting and lying. <br>
15 For jealousy and selfishness are not God's kind of wisdom. Such things are earthly, unspiritual, and demonic. <br>
16 For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind.<br>
17 But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and the fruit of good deeds. It shows no favouritism and is always sincere. <br>
18 And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds (of good things, seeds of justice, and seeds) of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness.<br>

Proverbs 18:21 KJV<br>
21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 18:21 NLT<br>
21 The tongue can bring death or life;<br>
those who love to talk will reap the consequences.<br>

<br>
Proverbs 10:19-21 (KJV)<br>
19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.<br>
20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.<br>
21 The lips of the righteous feed many: (but fools die for want of heart,) but fools die for want of wisdom.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 10: 19-21 NLT<br>
19<br>
Too much talk leads to sin.<br>
Be sensible and keep your mouth shut.<br>
20<br>
The words of the godly are like sterling silver;<br>
the heart of a fool is worthless.<br>
21<br>
The words of the godly encourage many,<br>
but fools are destroyed by their lack of common sense.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The Bible teaches us that, one of the ways how we can help to control our tongue, is to avoid talebearing, being a tale-bearer, and to avoid the spreading of gossip and rumours.<br>
In other words, avoid judging other people that are not there, with you, and avoid talking about someone if that person is not there, in the same room with you at that time. Can you think of something nice to say about that person instead?<br>
Pray for that person instead, and pray about your attitude, and what you are feeling in your heart towards that person.<br>
Fire, plus fire, firing back, equals more fire. Don't feed the fire. Don't respond to a fire by adding more fire to it. Stop fueling around with fire!<br>
May the Lord bless and protect your relationship with that other person, and may the Lord bless and protect the relationship that this other person has with the Lord, Jesus Christ, and that we would both receive wisdom, repentance, deliverance, salvation, and forgiveness.<br>
In Jesus' Name, Amen.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 11:13 (KJV)<br>
A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 18:8 (KJV)<br>
The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 26:20 (KJV)<br>
Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 26:22 (KJV)<br>
The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 20:19 (KJV)<br>
He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.<br>

Leviticus 19:16 (KJV)<br>
Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer amongst thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the Lord.<br>

<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:28 (KJV)<br>
A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:28 NLT<br>
A troublemaker plants seeds of strife;<br>
gossip separates the best of friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 17:9 (KJV)<br>
He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 17:9 NLT<br>
Love prospers when a fault is forgiven,<br>
but dwelling on it separates close friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Since we are talking about gossip and spreading rumours, there is a spot at the end of Romans, chapter 1, that does mention gossip.<br>
People that enjoy spreading gossip are known as talebearers or whisperers.<br>
Sin can be like a pit. Once you fall in, you can get stuck in it, and it can be hard to climb out of that pit.<br>
Some people give-up trying to get out of their pit of sin, and they stay there, and live there, and they decorate it with nice furniture.<br>
<br>
There is a difference between a safety net and a trampoline.<br>
The Lord can be your safety net, but He will not allow you to use him as a trampoline.<br>
Sometimes we accidentally fall into that pit of sin, but then there are those who deliberately jump into sin.<br>
The Lord will be our safety net for when we accidentally fall into a pit of sin, but he will not keep on being a trampoline for those who want to keep on jumping into sin.<br>
Gossip is one of those things that people do when they decide to continue to keep on practising sin.<br>
<br>
As we mentioned before, the chapters were not originally in the Bible, not until the year 1560.<br>
If we ignore the spots where chapters begin and end, we see something at the end of Romans chapter 1 as we keep reading into a little bit of chapter 2.<br>
This is talking about those who decide to worship their sin as if it was a god, and are determined to continue sinning.<br>
But at the place where we stop, in Romans 2, verse 4, we see that, even with those who are addicted to their sin, He still wants to help them change direction.<br>
It's God's kindness and love that leads habitual, addicted sinners to change direction, which is what the word, repentance, means.<br>
It is the Lord Jesus doing miracles in us that give us the wisdom, strength and ability to stop going any further in the wrong direction, and He is the one who kindly leads us in the right direction.<br>
<br>
We're going to start reading in Romans, chapter 1, and read verses 21 and 22, how it kind of all starts to get worse, even though we were all born with a sinful nature.<br>
Then, we will skip to verse 28 and keep reading right into the next Romans chapter 2, and then we will stop when we get to verse 4.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 1<br>
21 ...when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.<br>
22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,<br>
<br>
28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;<br>
29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,<br>
30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<br>
31 Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:<br>
32 Who knowing the judgement of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.<br>
1 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.<br>
2 But we are sure that the judgement of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.<br>
3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgement of God?<br>
4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look at all of that again in the NLT.<br>
Romans 1, verse 21, 22, then we jump to verse 28, and we keep reading all the way to Romans, chapter 2, verse 4.<br>
NLT<br>
21 Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused. <br>
22 Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools. <br>
<br>
28 Since they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that should never be done. <br>
29 Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarrelling, deception, malicious behaviour, and gossip. <br>
30 They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents. <br>
31 They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no mercy. <br>
32 They know God's justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die, yet they do them anyway. Worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.<br>
1 You may think you can condemn such people, but you are just as bad, and you have no excuse! When you say they are wicked and should be punished, you are condemning yourself, for you who judge others do these very same things. <br>
2 And we know that God, in his justice, will punish anyone who does such things. <br>
3 Since you judge others for doing these things, why do you think you can avoid God's judgement when you do the same things? <br>
4 Don't you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 17:30 (KJV)<br>
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:<br>
<br>
Acts 17: 30 & 31 -- NLT<br>
30 "God overlooked people's ignorance about these things in earlier times, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent of their sins and turn to him. <br>
31 For he has set a day for judging the world with justice....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 1:15 (KJV)<br>
And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.<br>
<br>
Mark 1:15 NLT<br>
Jesus went into Galilee, where he preached God's Good News, (the Good News of the Kingdom of God.)<br>
15 "The time promised by God has come at last!" he announced. "The Kingdom of God is near! Repent of your sins and believe the Good News!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 8:22 (KJV)<br>
Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<br>
<br>
Acts 8: 21-23 NLT<br>
21 ...your heart is not right with God. <br>
22 Repent of your wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive your evil thoughts, <br>
23 for I can see that you are full of bitter jealousy and are held captive by sin."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Repent means, to change direction.<br>
Even if you have walked 1000 miles away from Jesus, he is still just one prayer away.<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, Save me!  Help me! Help me repent and turn away from sin, and help me become the person that you want me to be.<br>
Enter into my heart, mind, and soul, bring into me what is missing, fix what is broken, and cast out of me all that does not belong within me.<br>
I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord, and that God raised you, Jesus, up from the dead. I thankfully receive your forgiveness.<br>
In Jesus' name, Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 18:8 (KJV)<br>
If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 18: 7 & 8 NLT<br>
7 If I announce that a certain nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed, <br>
8 but then that nation renounces its evil ways, I will not destroy it as I had planned. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 3:19 (KJV)<br>
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;<br>
<br>
Acts 3: 19 & 20 -- NLT<br>
19 Now repent of your sins and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped away. <br>
20 Then times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord, and he will again send you Jesus, your appointed Messiah.<br>

Passover Lamb<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is only a short preview of a bigger Bible Study where we study the Passover feast.<br>
We will do a more, in-depth look at the Passover Feast on another day, here, soon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 1:29<br>
29The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.<br>
<br>
John 1:29 NLT<br>
29The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! <br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 5: parts of verses 7 & 8<br>
7 ...Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:<br>
8 Therefore let us keep the feast....<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 5: verse 7 again, and then reading all of verse 8<br>
7 ...Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:<br>
8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 5: 7 & 8 NLT<br>
(Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed.)<br>
Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us.<br>
8 So let us celebrate the festival, not with the old bread (not with old leaven) of wickedness and evil, but with the new bread (with unleavened bread) of sincerity and truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 12: verses 11 and 14<br>
...it is the Lord's passover.<br>
14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.<br>
<br>
Exodus 12: verses 11 and 14 NLT<br>
this is the Lord's Passover.<br>
14 "This is a day to remember. Each year, from generation to generation, you must celebrate it as a special festival to the Lord. This is a law for all time. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1: 18-23 KJV<br>
18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;<br>
19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:<br>
20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,<br>
21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.<br>
22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:<br>
23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1: 17-23 NLT<br>
17 And remember that the heavenly Father to whom you pray has no favourites. He will judge or reward you according to what you do. So you must live in reverent fear of him during your time here as "temporary residents." <br>
18 For you know that God paid a ransom to save you from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors. And it was not paid with mere gold or silver, which lose their value. <br>
19 It was the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God. <br>
20 God chose him as your ransom long before the world began, but now in these last days he has been revealed for your sake.<br>
21 Through Christ you have come to trust in God. And you have placed your faith and hope in God because he raised Christ from the dead and gave him great glory.<br>
22 You were cleansed from your sins when you obeyed the truth, so now you (must have brotherly love, and now you) must show sincere love to each other as brothers and sisters. (Love each other deeply with a pure heart.) Love each other deeply with all your heart.<br>
23 For you have been born again, but not to a life that will quickly end. Your new life will last forever because it comes from the eternal, living word of God.<br>

Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.<br>

Psalms 73 KJV<br>
A Psalm of Asaph.<br>
1 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.<br>
(Yet God is good to Israel, even to such as are for a clean heart, even to such as are clean of heart.)<br>
2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.<br>
3 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<br>
4 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is (fat and) firm.<br>
5 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.<br>
(They are not in the trouble of other men; neither are they plagued with other men.)<br>
6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.<br>
7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.<br>
(Their eyes stand out with fatness: they pass the thoughts of the heart.)<br>
8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.<br>
9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.<br>
10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.<br>
11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?<br>
12 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.<br>
13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.<br>
14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.<br>
(For all the day long have I been plagued, and my chastisement was every morning.)<br>
15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.<br>
16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me (it was labour in mine eyes);<br>
17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.<br>
18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.<br>
19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.<br>
20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.<br>
21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.<br>
22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.<br>
(So foolish was I, and I knew not: I was as a beast with thee.)<br>
23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.<br>
24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.<br>
25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.<br>
26 My flesh and my heart faileth: (but God is the rock of my heart,) but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.<br>
27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.<br>
28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy works.<br>

Psalms 73 NLT<br>
Book Three (Psalms 73–89)<br>
A psalm of Asaph.<br>
1<br>
Truly God is good to Israel,<br>
to those whose hearts are pure.<br>
2<br>
But as for me, I almost lost my footing.<br>
My feet were slipping, and I was almost gone.<br>
3<br>
For I envied the proud<br>
when I saw them prosper despite their wickedness.<br>
4<br>
They seem to live such painless lives;<br>
their bodies are so healthy and strong.<br>
5<br>
They don't have troubles like other people;<br>
they're not plagued with problems like everyone else.<br>
6<br>
They wear pride like a jewelled necklace<br>
and clothe themselves with cruelty.<br>
7<br>
These fat cats have everything<br>
their hearts could ever wish for!<br>
8<br>
They scoff and speak only evil;<br>
in their pride they seek to crush others.<br>
9<br>
They boast against the very heavens,<br>
and their words strut throughout the earth.<br>
10<br>
And so the people are dismayed and confused,<br>
drinking in all their words.<br>
11<br>
"What does God know?" they ask.<br>
"Does the Most High even know what's happening?"<br>
12<br>
Look at these wicked people --<br>
enjoying a life of ease whilst their riches multiply.<br>
13<br>
Did I keep my heart pure for nothing?<br>
Did I keep myself innocent for no reason?<br>
14<br>
I get nothing but trouble all day long;<br>
every morning brings me pain.<br>
15<br>
If I had really spoken this way to others,<br>
I would have been a traitor to your people.<br>
16<br>
So I tried to understand why the wicked prosper.<br>
But what a difficult task it is!<br>
17<br>
Then I went into your sanctuary, O God,<br>
and I finally understood the destiny of the wicked.<br>
18<br>
Truly, you put them on a slippery path<br>
and send them sliding over the cliff to destruction.<br>
19<br>
In an instant they are destroyed,<br>
completely swept away by terrors.<br>
20<br>
When you arise, O Lord,<br>
you will laugh at their silly ideas<br>
as a person laughs at dreams in the morning.<br>
21<br>
Then I realised that my heart was bitter,<br>
and I was all torn up inside.<br>
22<br>
I was so foolish and ignorant --<br>
I must have seemed like a senseless animal to you.<br>
23<br>
Yet I still belong to you;<br>
you hold my right hand.<br>
24<br>
You guide me with your counsel,<br>
leading me to a glorious destiny.<br>
25<br>
Whom have I in heaven but you?<br>
I desire you more than anything on earth.<br>
26<br>
My health may fail, and my spirit may grow weak,<br>
but God remains the strength of my heart;<br>
he is mine forever.<br>
27<br>
Those who desert him will perish,<br>
for you destroy those who abandon you.<br>
28<br>
But as for me, how good it is to be near God!<br>
I have made the Sovereign Lord my shelter,<br>
and I will tell everyone about the wonderful things you do.<br>

Money and Possessions<br>
<br>
Don't let your possessions possess you.<br>
<br>
"...for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth" (Luke 12:15).<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 15-23 KJV<br>
<br>
15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.<br>
16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:<br>
17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?<br>
18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.<br>
19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.<br>
20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?<br>
21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.<br>
22 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.<br>
23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 12: 15-23 NLT<br>
15 Then he said, "Beware! Guard against every kind of greed. Life is not measured by how much you own."<br>
16 Then he told them a story: "A rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops. <br>
17 He said to himself, 'What should I do? I don't have room for all my crops.' <br>
18 Then he said, 'I know! I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones. Then I'll have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods. <br>
19 And I'll sit back and say to myself, "My friend, you have enough stored away for years to come. Now take it easy! Eat, drink, and be merry!"'<br>
20 "But God said to him, 'You fool! You will die this very night. Then who will get everything you worked for?'<br>
21 "Yes, a person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God."<br>
22 Then, turning to his disciples, Jesus said, "That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life -- whether you have enough food to eat or enough clothes to wear.<br>
23 For life is more than food, and your body more than clothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 8:36 (KJV)<br>
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?<br>
<br>
Mark 8: 36 & 37 NLT<br>
36 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose (your self,) your own soul?<br>
37 Is anything worth more than your soul? (Is anything worth more than your self?)<br>
<br>
Matthew 16:26 (KJV)<br>
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<br>
<br>
Luke 9:25 (KJV)<br>
For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?<br>
<br>
Luke 9: 24 & 25 NLT<br>
24 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it. <br>
25 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but are yourself lost or destroyed?<br>

1 Timothy 6: 3-12 KJV<br>
3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;<br>
4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,<br>
5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.<br>
6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.<br>
7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.<br>
8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.<br>
9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.<br>
10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which whilst some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.<br>
11 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.<br>
12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 6: 3-12 NLT<br>
3 Some people may contradict our teaching, but these are the wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. These teachings promote a godly life. <br>
4 Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding. Such a person has an unhealthy desire to quibble over the meaning of words. This stirs up arguments ending in jealousy, division, slander, and evil suspicions. <br>
5 These people always cause trouble. Their minds are corrupt, and they have turned their backs on the truth. To them, a show of godliness is just a way to become wealthy.<br>
6 Yet true godliness with contentment is itself great wealth. <br>
7 After all, we brought nothing with us when we came into the world, and we can't take anything with us when we leave it. <br>
8 So if we have enough food and clothing, let us be content.<br>
9 But people who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction. <br>
10 For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. And some people, craving money, have wandered from the true faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.<br>
11 But you, Timothy, are a man of God; so run from all these evil things. Pursue righteousness and a godly life, along with faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness. <br>
12 Fight the good fight for the true faith. Hold tightly to the eternal life to which God has called you, which you have declared so well before many witnesses.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Name of the Lord<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 113:1 (KJV)<br>
Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
Psalms 116:13 (KJV)<br>
I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
Acts 19:5 (KJV)<br>
When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.<br>
<br>
Psalms 124:8 (KJV)<br>
Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 18:10 (KJV)<br>
The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.<br>
<br>
Psalms 20:7 (KJV)<br>
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.<br>
<br>
Psalms 7:17 (KJV)<br>
I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high.<br>
<br>
Micah 4:5 (KJV)<br>
For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.<br>
<br>
Micah 4:5 (NLT)<br>
Though the nations around us follow their idols,<br>
we will follow the Lord our God forever and ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 116:17 (KJV)<br>
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
Romans 10:13 (KJV)<br>
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.<br>
<br>
Acts 2:21 (KJV)<br>
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4:8 (KJV)<br>
...godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4: 7-10 NLT<br>
7 Do not waste time arguing over godless ideas and old wives' tales. Instead, train yourself to be godly. <br>
8 "Physical training is good, but training for godliness is much better, promising benefits in this life and in the life to come." <br>
9 This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it. <br>
10 This is why we work hard and continue to struggle, (and continue to suffer,) for our hope is in the living God, who is the Saviour of all people and particularly of all believers.<br>
<br>
The Lord's name is Jah. In English, in the KJV of the Bible, it is spelled, J, A, H, and it is pronounced, Yaw.<br>
Earlier, in a previous Bible Study that we did awhile ago, we were looking at Psalms 68: 1-7, and in there is the only place in the entire KJV Bible where the Lord's name, Jah, was not changed over to the English name, Lord.<br>
<br>
Psalms 68:4 (KJV)<br>
Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah, and rejoice before him.<br>
<br>
The English word, hallelujah, is commonly spelled, hallelujah, and this word, spelled this way, appears zero times in the KJV Bible.<br>
A more accurate way of spelling it would be, halaluyah. The Hebrew word means, Praise the Lord, You Praise The Lord, You People Praise the Lord, Praise Ye the Lord, and Praise God.<br>
Praise God. Do that. Praise God. All of you. Everybody. Praise God.<br>
In other words, it is telling us, all of us, all people, that we all need to Praise the Lord.<br>
When it says, You Praise The Lord, it means, all of you, as if one is saying that to a large crowd of people.<br>
You are commanding this to the crowd of people when the speaker says to the audience, You Praise The Lord.<br>
Hallelujah is a command being given out to the audience, to the crowd of people, commanding them to Praise the Lord.<br>
The English hallelujah spelled with Jah, J, A, H, at the end, is the way we see Jah spelled in Psalms 68:4.<br>
<br>
The first occurrence of the Name Yah that was translated into, The Lord, occurs in Exodus 15:2, where Moses and Israel sing a song regarding their deliverance from Pharaoh's horsemen.<br>
Exodus 15:2 & 3 KJV<br>
The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.<br>
3 The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.<br>
<br>
Jah is Jehovah in the shortened form. <br>
Jah is the proper name of the one true God.<br>
Jah is likely within names where the names are beginning with the letters 'Je'<br>
as well as names ending with 'iah' or 'jah.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One place where halaluyah was kept in an English form, in the KJV, was in Revelation 19, within verses 1 through 4, but in the KJV Bible, it was spelled, Alleluia, without the H.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 19<br>
1 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:<br>
2 For true and righteous are his judgements: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.<br>
3 And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.<br>
4 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.<br>
5 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.<br>
6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 26:4<br>
4 Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength (for in the Lord Jehovah is the rock of ages.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:4 (KJV)<br>
John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:4 NLT<br>
4This letter is from John to the seven churches in the province of Asia.<br>
(Asia was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey.)<br>
Grace and peace to you from the one who is, who always was, and who is still to come; (from the seven spirits,) from the sevenfold Spirit before his throne; and from Jesus Christ. <br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 4:8 (KJV)<br>
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 22:13 (KJV)<br>
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:8 (KJV)<br>
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:6 (KJV)<br>
And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:11 (KJV)<br>
Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.<br>

And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;<br>
<br>

And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:<br>

Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the Lord, the first, and with the last; I am he.<br>

Isaiah 48:12 (KJV)<br>
Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.<br>

Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.<br>

<p>
<br>
Enoch in the Bible<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch in the Bible<br>
<br>
Before we look at Enoch in the Bible, here is a little something to think about.<br>
<br>
Maybe there originally were, perhaps, over 100 books that were in the Bible?<br>
Today, the Bible that we have today, the Holy Bible, is made of 66 books.<br>
<br>
There used to be a Jewish Greek book titled, The Assumption of Moses, or, the Testament of Moses, that may have told a story about Michael, the archangel, and the devil, and the two of them having some kind of contest or dispute over the body of Moses, but this book no longer exists.<br>
There are a few other places in the Bible that refer to books which may no longer exist.<br>
Throughout time, there have been attempts of people trying to destroy all known copies of some books that used to be in the Bible.<br>
It is always possible that these books, or fragments of these books, may still exist, and that they are just lost or hidden in some unknown place, and may be found again, or fragments may be found again someday.<br>
Some of these books may have originally been included in the collection of books that we call The Bible.<br>
And, to make matters even more complicated, some have tried to write fake or fictional versions of the ancient books, claiming that they are these original, lost books, when, in fact, they are filled with mistakes which prove that they are fake, fictional books which someone was trying to promote as being the real deal.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the Bible, we have some of these lost or forgotten book titles mentioned.<br>
Let's look at some examples.<br>
We are not doing the extra research at this time to find out if any of these books exist anymore -- maybe they do, maybe they don't or maybe we'll find them again someday.<br>
Several of these books can still be found today, translated into English, on various websites.<br>
We will now look at some verses that mention these lost or forgotten book titles.<br>
On other websites, one can find The Book of Jashar available for reading in English, even though it is not in our Bibles anymore.<br>
The KJV originally had some additional books, but they were eventually removed later on.<br>
<br>
Known in Hebrew as, "Yah-Sharr," you will see here next, Jasher in the KJV, which is Jashar in the NLT; the spelling of Jasher's name varies slightly, between the KJV and the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 1: 17 & 18 (KJV)<br>
17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:<br>
18 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)<br>
(it is written in the book of the upright.)<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 1: 17 & 18 (NLT)<br>
17 Then David composed a funeral song for Saul and Jonathan,<br>
18 and he commanded that it be taught to the people of Judah. It is known as the Song of the Bow, and it is recorded in The Book of Jashar (The Book of the Upright).<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 10: 12 & 13 KJV<br>
12 Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.<br>
(Sun, be silent upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.)<br>
<br>
13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.<br>
(Is not this written in the book of the upright? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Joshua 10: 12-14 NLT<br>
12 On the day the Lord gave the Israelites victory over the Amorites, Joshua prayed to the Lord in front of all the people of Israel. He said,<br>
"Let the sun stand still over Gibeon,<br>
and the moon over the valley of Aijalon."<br>
13 So the sun stood still and the moon stayed in place until the nation of Israel had defeated its enemies.<br>
Is this event not recorded in The Book of Jashar? (The Book of the Upright?) The sun stayed in the middle of the sky, and it did not set as on a normal day.<br>
14 There has never been a day like this one before or since, when the Lord answered such a prayer. Surely the Lord fought for Israel that day!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 21: 13-15 KJV<br>
13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.<br>
<br>
(Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, What he did in Vaheb, and in Suphah)<br>
14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,<br>
<br>
15 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon (and leaneth upon) the border of Moab.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 21: 13-15 NLT<br>
13 Then they moved out and camped on the far side of the Arnon River, in the wilderness adjacent to the territory of the Amorites. The Arnon is the boundary line between the Moabites and the Amorites.<br>
14 For this reason The Book of the Wars of the Lord speaks of "the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the ravines of the Arnon River,<br>
15 and the ravines that extend as far as the settlement of Ar on the border of Moab."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 12:15 (KJV)<br>
Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies?<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Kings 11:41 (KJV)<br>
And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 9:29 (KJV)<br>
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 33:19 (KJV)<br>
(King Manasseh's) prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written amongst the sayings of the seers.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 33:19 (NLT)<br>
Manasseh's prayer, the account of the way God answered him, and an account of all his sins and unfaithfulness are recorded in The Record of the Seers.<br>
(This book is also known as, the sayings of the seers, the sayings of Hosai, or The Record of Hosai.)<br>
It includes a list of the locations where he built pagan shrines and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself and repented.<br>
<br>
In original English, Hosai is spelled, H o s a i.<br>
In American English, Hosai is spelled, H o z a i.<br>
<br>
<br>
Esther 10:2 (KJV)<br>
And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?<br>
<br>
<br>
There may be some books that the Lord has kept hidden, and are intended to be found again someday, near or during the End Times.<br>
<br>
Daniel 12:4 (KJV)<br>
But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.<br>
NLT:<br>
4 But you, Daniel, keep this prophecy a secret; seal up the book until the time of the end, when many will rush here and there, and knowledge will increase."<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 22:10 (KJV)<br>
And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Even though the book of Enoch is not one of the 66 books found in the Holy Bible today, it is still mentioned in the Bible.<br>
In previous centuries, there used to be more than 66 books in the Bible.<br>
<br>
Genesis 5:24 (KJV)<br>
And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.<br>
<br>
Genesis 5: 21-24 NLT<br>
21 When Enoch was 65 years old, he became the father of Methuselah. <br>
22 After the birth of Methuselah, Enoch lived in close fellowship with God for another 300 years, and he had other sons and daughters. <br>
23 Enoch lived 365 years, <br>
24 walking in close fellowship with God. Then one day he disappeared, because God took him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jude 1:14 (KJV)<br>
And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,<br>
<br>
Jude 1: verses 8, 9 and 10, and then we jump to verses 14, 15 and 16, in the NLT<br>
8 In the same way, these people -- who claim authority from their dreams -- live immoral lives, defy authority, and scoff at supernatural beings.<br>
(The original Greek language called the supernatural beings, glorious ones.)<br>
(these people live immoral lives, defy authority, and scoff at glorious ones, which are probably evil angels.)<br>
9 But even Michael, (the archangel,) one of the mightiest of the angels, did not dare accuse the devil of blasphemy, but simply said, "The Lord rebuke you!" <br>
(This took place when Michael was arguing with the devil about Moses' body.) <br>
10 But these people scoff at things they do not understand. Like unthinking animals, they do whatever their instincts tell them, and so they bring about their own destruction. <br>
<br>
14 Enoch, who lived in the seventh generation after Adam, prophesied about these people. He said, "Listen! The Lord is coming with countless thousands of his holy ones <br>
15 to execute judgement on the people of the world. He will convict every person of all the ungodly things they have done and for all the insults that ungodly sinners have spoken against him." (this verse, here in the book of Jude, is a quote from the book of Enoch, chapter 1, verse 9.)<br>
16 These people are grumblers and complainers, living only to satisfy their desires. They brag loudly about themselves, and they flatter others to get what they want.<br>
<br>
What Enoch was saying there in verse 14, there is something very similar to that in Deuteronomy 33, verse 2.<br>
Let's look at verses 1 through 3.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 33: 1-3 KJV<br>
1 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.<br>
2 And he said, The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them, (a fire of law for them).<br>
3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 33: 1-4 NLT<br>
NLT<br>
1 This is the blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave to the people of Israel before his death:<br>
2 "The Lord came from Mount Sinai<br>
and dawned upon us<br>
(The Lord came from Mount Seir and dawned upon them;)<br>
he shone forth from Mount Paran<br>
and came from Meribah-kadesh<br>
with flaming fire at his right hand.<br>
<br>
(he shone forth from Mount Paran and came from myriads of holy ones, from the south, from his mountain slopes.)<br>
(In parts of verse 2, the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.)<br>
3<br>
Indeed, he loves his people; (Indeed, lover of the peoples;)<br>
all his holy ones are in his hands.<br>
They follow in his steps<br>
and accept his teaching.<br>
4<br>
Moses gave us the Lord's instruction,<br>
the special possession of the people of Israel.<br>
<br>
(Moses gave us the Lord's instruction, the special possession of the people of Jacob.) <br>
The names "Jacob" and "Israel" are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 11:5 (KJV)<br>
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 11: 5 & 6  NLT<br>
5 It was by faith that Enoch was taken up to heaven without dying -- "he disappeared, because God took him." (Gen 5:24.) For before he was taken up, he was known as a person who pleased God. <br>
6 And it is impossible to please God without faith. Anyone who wants to come to him must believe that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him.<br>

<br>
Daniel in the Lions' Den<br>
<br>
Daniel 6<br>
1 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;<br>
2 And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.<br>
3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.<br>
4 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.<br>
5 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.<br>
6 Then these presidents and princes (came tumultuously, and) assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.<br>
7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and (to make a firm interdict,) to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.<br>
8 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not (which passeth not).<br>
9 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.<br>
10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.<br>
11 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.<br>
<br>
12 Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.<br>
13 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.<br>
14 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.<br>
15 Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.<br>
<br>
16 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.<br>
17 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.<br>
18 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: (neither were table of musick brought before him,) neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.<br>
19 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.<br>
20 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?<br>
21 Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.<br>
22 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.<br>
<br>
23 Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.<br>
24 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.<br>
25 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.<br>
26 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.<br>
27 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions (who hath delivered Daniel from the hand of the lions).<br>
28 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 6 NLT<br>
<br>
1 Darius the Mede decided to divide the kingdom into 120 provinces, and he appointed a high officer to rule over each province. <br>
2 The king also chose Daniel and two others as administrators to supervise the high officers and protect the king's interests. <br>
3 Daniel soon proved himself more capable than all the other administrators and high officers. Because of Daniel's great ability, the king made plans to place him over the entire empire.<br>
4 Then the other administrators and high officers began searching for some fault in the way Daniel was handling government affairs, but they couldn't find anything to criticise or condemn. He was faithful, always responsible, and completely trustworthy. <br>
5 So they concluded, "Our only chance of finding grounds for accusing Daniel will be in connection with the rules of his religion."<br>
6 So the administrators and high officers went to the king and said, "Long live King Darius! <br>
7 We are all in agreement -- we administrators, officials, high officers, advisers, and governors -- that the king should make a law that will be strictly enforced. Give orders that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human -- except to you, Your Majesty -- will be thrown into the den of lions. <br>
8 And now, Your Majesty, issue and sign this law so it cannot be changed, an official law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked." <br>
9 So King Darius signed the law.<br>
10 But when Daniel learned that the law had been signed, he went home and knelt down as usual in his upstairs room, with its windows open toward Jerusalem. He prayed three times a day, just as he had always done, giving thanks to his God. <br>
11 Then the officials went together to Daniel's house and found him praying and asking for God's help. <br>
<br>
12<br>
So they went straight to the king and reminded him about his law. "Did you not sign a law that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human -- except to you, Your Majesty -- will be thrown into the den of lions?"<br>
"Yes," the king replied, "that decision stands; it is an official law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked."<br>
13 Then they told the king, "That man Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, is ignoring you and your law. He still prays to his God three times a day."<br>
14 Hearing this, the king was deeply troubled, and he tried to think of a way to save Daniel. He spent the rest of the day looking for a way to get Daniel out of this predicament.<br>
15 In the evening the men went together to the king and said, "Your Majesty, you know that according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, no law that the king signs can be changed."<br>
<br>
16 So at last the king gave orders for Daniel to be arrested and thrown into the den of lions. The king said to him, "May your God, whom you serve so faithfully, rescue you."<br>
17 A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed the stone with his own royal seal and the seals of his nobles, so that no one could rescue Daniel. <br>
18 Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night fasting. He refused his usual entertainment and couldn't sleep at all that night.<br>
19 Very early the next morning, the king got up and hurried out to the lions' den. <br>
20 When he got there, he called out in anguish, "Daniel, servant of the living God! Was your God, whom you serve so faithfully, able to rescue you from the lions?"<br>
21 Daniel answered, "Long live the king! <br>
22 My God sent his angel to shut the lions' mouths so that they would not hurt me, for I have been found innocent in his sight. And I have not wronged you, Your Majesty."<br>
<br>
23 The king was overjoyed and ordered that Daniel be lifted from the den. Not a scratch was found on him, for he had trusted in his God.<br>
24 Then the king gave orders to arrest the men who had maliciously accused Daniel. He had them thrown into the lions' den, along with their wives and children. The lions leaped on them and tore them apart before they even hit the floor of the den.<br>
25<br>
Then King Darius sent this message to the people of every race and nation and language throughout the world:<br>
"Peace and prosperity to you!<br>
26<br>
"I decree that everyone throughout my kingdom should tremble with fear before the God of Daniel.<br>
For he is the living God,<br>
and he will endure forever.<br>
His kingdom will never be destroyed,<br>
and his rule will never end.<br>
27<br>
He rescues and saves his people;<br>
he performs miraculous signs and wonders<br>
in the heavens and on earth.<br>
He has rescued Daniel<br>
from the power of the lions."<br>
28 So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: That was the story of Daniel in the Lions' Den, in the book of Daniel, chapter 6.<br>
A while ago, we also read the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, which is also found in the book of Daniel, chapter 3.<br>
Think carefully about these two stories.<br>
What do they both have in common?<br>
How are both of these stories similar?<br>

Genesis 11: 1-9 KJV<br>
starting in the last verse at the end of chapter 10...<br>
32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.<br>
1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.<br>
(And the whole earth was of one lip, and of one words.)<br>
2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed (eastward,) from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.<br>
3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. <br>
(And a man said to his neighbour, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them to a burning thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.)<br>
4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.<br>
5 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.<br>
6 And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.<br>
7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.<br>
8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.<br>
9 Therefore is the name of it called (Confusion,) Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 11: 1-9 NLT starting in the last verse of chapter 10<br>
(Chapter 10 just got done giving the list of the clans that descended from Noah's sons.)<br>
32 These are the clans that descended from Noah's sons, arranged by nation according to their lines of descent. All the nations of the earth descended from these clans after the great flood.<br>
1 At one time all the people of the world spoke the same language and used the same words. <br>
2 As the people migrated to the east, they found a plain in the land of Babylonia and settled there.<br>
(The original Hebrew word used here for the land of Babylonia, was, Shinar.)<br>
3 They began saying to each other, "Let's make bricks and harden them with fire." (In this region bricks were used instead of stone, and tar was used for mortar.) <br>
4 Then they said, "Come, let's build a great city for ourselves with a tower that reaches into the sky. This will make us famous and keep us from being scattered all over the world."<br>
5 But the Lord came down to look at the city and the tower the people were building. <br>
6 "Look!" he said. "The people are united, and they all speak the same language. After this, nothing they set out to do will be impossible for them! <br>
7 Come, let's go down and confuse the people with different languages. Then they won't be able to understand each other."<br>
8 In that way, the Lord scattered them all over the world, and they stopped building the city. <br>
(That is why the city was called Babel, or Babylon. Babel sounds like a Hebrew term that means "confusion.")<br>
9 That is why the city was called Babel because that is where the Lord confused the people with different languages. In this way he scattered them all over the world.<br>
<br>
Mark 16:15<br>
And (Jesus) said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. <br>
<br>
Matthew 28 (KJV) -- verses 18, 19, and 20, the last three verses of Chapter 28...<br>
18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.<br>
19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br>
20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  What else can we learn from this? Is there another perspective to consider?<br>
It was the Lord's idea to make different languages.<br>
Are we all supposed to come together and live as one?<br>
Are the sheep and the goats, the wheat, the chaff and the tares (the weeds) all supposed to coexist together in unity?<br>
Jesus did not come to bring peace on earth.<br>
He came to bring a sword and division. (Matthew 10:34 and Luke 12:51)<br>
There is something interesting here that we should learn and study.<br>
The word, coexist, is not found in the Bible.<br>

Jeremiah 8: 14 & 15 (KJV)<br>
14 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the Lord our God hath put us to silence, and given us (poison to drink,) water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the Lord.<br>

For the Lord our God has decreed our destruction<br>
and has given us a cup of poison to drink<br>
because we sinned against the Lord.<br>
15<br>
We hoped for peace, but no peace came.<br>
We hoped for a time of healing, but found only terror.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look at the story about Joseph's Leadership in the Famine:<br>
Genesis 47: 19-21 KJV<br>
19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.<br>
20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.<br>
21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 47: 19-21 NLT<br>
19 Why should we die before your very eyes? Buy us and our land in exchange for food; we offer our land and ourselves as slaves for Pharaoh. Just give us grain so we may live and not die, and so the land does not become empty and desolate."<br>
20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. All the Egyptians sold him their fields because the famine was so severe, and soon all the land belonged to Pharaoh. <br>
21 As for the people, he made them all slaves, (and he moved them all into the towns,) from one end of Egypt to the other.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 12-15 (KJV)<br>
12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;<br>
13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.<br>
14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:<br>
15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 12-15 NLT<br>
12 So take a new grip with your tired hands and strengthen your weak knees. <br>
13 Mark out a straight path for your feet so that those who are weak and lame will not fall but become strong.<br>
14 Work at living in peace with everyone, and work at living a holy life, for those who are not holy will not see the Lord. <br>
15 Look after each other so that none of you fails to receive the grace of God. Watch out that no poisonous root of bitterness grows up to trouble you, corrupting many. <br>
<br>
What we just read there, in Hebrews 12, some of those parts sound like the opposite of Isaiah 59.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59:8 (KJV)<br>
The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgement in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59: 7 & 8 (NLT)<br>
7<br>
Their feet run to do evil,<br>
and they rush to commit murder.<br>
They think only about sinning.<br>
Misery and destruction always follow them.<br>
8<br>
They don't know where to find peace<br>
or what it means to be just and good.<br>
They have mapped out crooked roads,<br>
and no one who follows them knows a moment's peace.<br>
<br>

<br>
Elijah and The God Contest<br>
<br>
There are many stories, adventures and miracles in the books of 1 Kings and 2 Kings.<br>
<br>
One of the cool heroes of the Bible is Elijah.<br>
This is only a short, edited collection of just some of the stories involving Elijah.<br>
We're going to mainly use just the NLT in some areas here, so that we can quickly and easily get an idea of what's going on.<br>
Elijah just suddenly comes on the scene in 1 Kings 17:1 <br>
Let's look at that verse in the NLT.<br>
1 Now Elijah, who was from Tishbe in Gilead, told King Ahab, "As surely as the Lord, the God of Israel, lives -- the God I serve -- there will be no dew or rain during the next few years until I give the word!"<br>
<br>
Other amazing things happen later on in this chapter 17.<br>
<br>
1 Kings 17, verses 2, 3 and 4 (NLT)<br>
It's about Elijah being Fed by Ravens<br>
2 Then the Lord said to Elijah, <br>
3 "Go to the east and hide by Kerith Brook, near where it enters the Jordan River. <br>
4 Drink from the brook and eat what the ravens bring you, for I have commanded them to bring you food."<br>
<br>
1 Kings 17, verse 12, then we will read verses 14-17, and then we will skip down from verse 17 to verse 20 (NLT)<br>
These are miracles involving the Widow at Zarephath<br>
12 But (the widow) said, "I swear by the Lord your God that I don't have a single piece of bread in the house. And I have only a handful of flour left in the jar and a little cooking oil in the bottom of the jug. I was just gathering a few sticks to cook this last meal, and then my son and I will die."<br>
skipping to verse 14, Elijah says<br>
14 For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: There will always be flour and olive oil left in your containers until the time when the Lord sends rain and the crops grow again!"<br>
15 So she did as Elijah said, and she and Elijah and her family continued to eat for many days. <br>
16 There was always enough flour and olive oil left in the containers, just as the Lord had promised through Elijah.<br>
17 Some time later the woman's son became sick. He grew worse and worse, and finally he died.<br>
That was verse 17. Skipping now to verse 20...<br>
20 Then Elijah cried out to the Lord, "O Lord my God, why have you brought tragedy to this widow who has opened her home to me, causing her son to die?"<br>
21 And he stretched himself out over the child three times and cried out to the Lord, "O Lord my God, please let this child's life return to him." <br>
22 The Lord heard Elijah's prayer, and the life of the child returned, and he revived! <br>
23 Then Elijah brought him down from the upper room and gave him to his mother. "Look!" he said. "Your son is alive!"<br>
<br>
One really amazing story that involves Elijah, is in the next chapter, 1 Kings 18.<br>
The God Contest on Mount Carmel<br>
(Some of the original Hebrew meanings are shown whilst repeating the verse again, within round brackets.)<br>
1 Kings 18, starting in verse 1, then we'll skip to verse 7, and keep reading into the next chapter, chapter 19, and just read the first two verses in chapter 19.<br>
KJV<br>
1 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.<br>
let's fast-forward to verse 7...<br>
7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?<br>
8 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.<br>
9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?<br>
10 As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.<br>
11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.<br>
12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth.<br>
13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord, how I hid an hundred men of the Lord's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?<br>
14 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.<br>
15 And Elijah said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.<br>
16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.<br>
17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?<br>
18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim.<br>
19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.<br>
20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.<br>
21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, (How long halt ye between two thoughts?) How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.<br>
22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.<br>
23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:<br>
24 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, (The word is good,) It is well spoken.<br>
25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.<br>
<br>
26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.<br>
(And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, answer us. But there was no voice, nor any that heard. And they leaped up and down at the altar which was made.)<br>
<br>
27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.<br>
(And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry with a great voice: for he is a god; either he meditateth, or he hath a pursuit, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.)<br>
<br>
28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.<br>
(And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till poured out blood upon them.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.<br>
(And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the ascending of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any attention.)<br>
<br>
30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.<br>
31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:<br>
32 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.<br>
33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.<br>
34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.<br>
35 And the water (went round about, and the water) ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.<br>
36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.<br>
37 Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.<br>
38 Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.<br>
39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord, he is the God; the Lord, he is the God.<br>
40 And Elijah said unto them, (Apprehend and) Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.<br>
41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is (a sound of a noise of rain,) a sound of abundance of rain.<br>
42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,<br>
43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.<br>
44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, (Tie thy chariot, Bind thy chariot,) Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.<br>
45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.<br>
46 And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, (and ran before Ahab till thou come to Jezreel,) and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. <br>
1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.<br>
2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Kings 18 NLT<br>
The NLT of what we just read.<br>
Again, we will read 1 Kings 18, starting in verse 1, then we'll skip to verse 7, and keep reading into the next chapter, chapter 19, and just read the first two verses in chapter 19.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Later on, in the third year of the drought, the Lord said to Elijah, "Go and present yourself to King Ahab. Tell him that I will soon send rain!"<br>
jumping again to verse 7...<br>
7 As Obadiah was walking along, he suddenly saw Elijah coming toward him. Obadiah recognised him at once and bowed low to the ground before him. "Is it really you, my lord Elijah?" he asked.<br>
8 "Yes, it is," Elijah replied. "Now go and tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'"<br>
9 "Oh, sir," Obadiah protested, "what harm have I done to you that you are sending me to my death at the hands of Ahab? <br>
10 For I swear by the Lord your God that the king has searched every nation and kingdom on earth from end to end to find you. And each time he was told, 'Elijah isn't here,' King Ahab forced the king of that nation to swear to the truth of his claim. <br>
11 And now you say, 'Go and tell your master, "Elijah is here."' <br>
12 But as soon as I leave you, the Spirit of the Lord will carry you away to who knows where. When Ahab comes and cannot find you, he will kill me. Yet I have been a true servant of the Lord all my life. <br>
13 Has no one told you, my lord, about the time when Jezebel was trying to kill the Lord's prophets? I hid 100 of them in two caves and supplied them with food and water. <br>
14 And now you say, 'Go and tell your master, "Elijah is here."' Sir, if I do that, Ahab will certainly kill me."<br>
15 But Elijah said, "I swear by the Lord Almighty, in whose presence I stand, that I will present myself to Ahab this very day."<br>
16 So Obadiah went to tell Ahab that Elijah had come, and Ahab went out to meet Elijah. <br>
17 When Ahab saw him, he exclaimed, "So, is it really you, you troublemaker of Israel?"<br>
18 "I have made no trouble for Israel," Elijah replied. "You and your family are the troublemakers, for you have refused to obey the commands of the Lord and have worshiped the images of Baal instead. <br>
19 Now summon all Israel to join me at Mount Carmel, along with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who are supported by Jezebel (and who eat at Jezebel's table.)<br>
20 So Ahab summoned all the people of Israel and the prophets to Mount Carmel. <br>
21 Then Elijah stood in front of them and said, "How much longer will you waver, hobbling between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him! But if Baal is God, then follow him!" But the people were completely silent.<br>
22 Then Elijah said to them, "I am the only prophet of the Lord who is left, but Baal has 450 prophets. <br>
23 Now bring two bulls. The prophets of Baal may choose whichever one they wish and cut it into pieces and lay it on the wood of their altar, but without setting fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood on the altar, but not set fire to it. <br>
24 Then call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord. The god who answers by setting fire to the wood is the true God!" And all the people agreed.<br>
25 Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "You go first, for there are many of you. Choose one of the bulls, and prepare it and call on the name of your god. But do not set fire to the wood."<br>
26 So they prepared one of the bulls and placed it on the altar. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning until noontime, shouting, "O Baal, answer us!" But there was no reply of any kind. Then they danced, hobbling around the altar they had made.<br>
27 About noontime Elijah began mocking them. "You'll have to shout louder," he scoffed, "for surely he is a god! Perhaps he is daydreaming, or is relieving himself, (or is busy somewhere else, or is engaged in business). Or maybe he is away on a trip, or is asleep and needs to be wakened!"<br>
28 So they shouted louder, and following their normal custom, they cut themselves with knives and swords until the blood gushed out. <br>
29 They raved all afternoon until the time of the evening sacrifice, but still there was no sound, no reply, no response.<br>
30 Then Elijah called to the people, "Come over here!" They all crowded around him as he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been torn down. <br>
31 He took twelve stones, one to represent each of the tribes of Israel, (twelve stones, one for each of the tribes of the sons of Jacob to whom the Lord had said, "Your name will be Israel.")<br>
32 and he used the stones to rebuild the altar in the name of the Lord. Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold about three gallons of seeds. (In the original Hebrew, it said that he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold about 2 seahs, which is about 14.6 litres of seed.)<br>
33 He piled wood on the altar, cut the bull into pieces, and laid the pieces on the wood.<br>
Then he said, "Fill four large jars with water, and pour the water over the offering and the wood."<br>
34 After they had done this, he said, "Do the same thing again!" And when they were finished, he said, "Now do it a third time!" So they did as he said, <br>
35 and the water ran around the altar and even filled the trench.<br>
36 At the usual time for offering the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet walked up to the altar and prayed, "O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,<br>
<br>
(By the way, the names "Jacob" and "Israel" are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation. As a result, the prayer could have also started like this...)<br>
<br>
(Elijah the prophet walked up to the altar and prayed, "O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,) prove today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant. Prove that I have done all this at your command. <br>
<br>
37 O Lord, answer me! Answer me so these people will know that you, O Lord, are God and that you have brought them back to yourself."<br>
38 Immediately the fire of the Lord flashed down from heaven and burned up the young bull, the wood, the stones, and the dust. It even licked up all the water in the trench! <br>
39 And when all the people saw it, they fell face down on the ground and cried out, "The Lord -- he is God! Yes, the Lord is God!"<br>
40 Then Elijah commanded, "Seize all the prophets of Baal. Don't let a single one escape!" So the people seized them all, and Elijah took them down to the Kishon Valley and killed them there.<br>
41 Then Elijah said to Ahab, "Go get something to eat and drink, for I hear a mighty rainstorm coming!"<br>
42 So Ahab went to eat and drink. But Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel and bowed low to the ground and prayed with his face between his knees.<br>
43 Then he said to his servant, "Go and look out toward the sea."<br>
The servant went and looked, then returned to Elijah and said, "I didn't see anything."<br>
Seven times Elijah told him to go and look. <br>
44 Finally the seventh time, his servant told him, "I saw a little cloud about the size of a man's hand rising from the sea."<br>
Then Elijah shouted, "Hurry to Ahab and tell him, 'Climb into your chariot and go back home. If you don't hurry, the rain will stop you!'"<br>
45 And soon the sky was black with clouds. A heavy wind brought a terrific rainstorm, and Ahab left quickly for Jezreel. <br>
46 Then the Lord gave special strength to Elijah. (He bound up his loins, which means that) He tucked his cloak into his belt and ran ahead of Ahab's chariot all the way to the entrance of Jezreel.<br>
1 When Ahab got home, he told Jezebel everything Elijah had done, including the way he had killed all the prophets of Baal. <br>
2 So Jezebel sent this message to Elijah: "May the gods strike me and even kill me if by this time tomorrow I have not killed you just as you killed them."<br>
<br>
<br>
And that's where we stopped reading, right there in 1 Kings, chapter 19, verse 2.<br>
Did Jezebel's words come true?  <br>
No. Elijah was just fine the next day, and the day after that.<br>
Here is what eventually happened to Elijah.<br>
<br>
2 Kings 2, verses 9 through 11, followed by verse 15 KJV<br>
9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.<br>
10 And he said, (Thou hast done hard in asking,) Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. <br>
11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.<br>
then, at verse 15...<br>
15 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.<br>
<br>
2 Kings 2, verses 9 through 11, followed by verse 15 NLT<br>
9 When they came to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me what I can do for you before I am taken away."<br>
And Elisha replied, "Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit and become your successor."<br>
10 "You have asked a difficult thing," Elijah replied. "If you see me when I am taken from you, then you will get your request. But if not, then you won't."<br>
11 As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire appeared, drawn by horses of fire. It drove between the two men, separating them, and Elijah was carried by a whirlwind into heaven. <br>
15 When the group of prophets from Jericho saw from a distance what happened, they exclaimed, "Elijah's spirit rests upon Elisha!" And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.<br>
<br>
And then, the cool stuff that was happening with Elijah was then happening to his successor, Elisha.<br>
<br>
2 Kings 6: 4-7 NLT<br>
When they arrived at the Jordan, they began cutting down trees. <br>
5 But as one of them was cutting a tree, his axe head fell into the river. "Oh, sir!" he cried. "It was a borrowed axe!"<br>
6 "Where did it fall?" the man of God asked. When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot. Then the axe head floated to the surface. <br>
7 "Grab it," Elisha said. And the man reached out and grabbed it.<br>
<br>
2 Kings 6 KJV<br>
Chapter 6 is also the chapter where we read this other cool story that we recently looked at...<br>
15 And when (the minister,) the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?<br>
16 And (Elisha) answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.<br>
17 And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.<br>
<br>
2 Kings 6: 14-17 NLT<br>
14 So one night the king of Aram sent a great army with many chariots and horses to surround the city.<br>
15 When the servant of the man of God got up early the next morning and went outside, there were troops, horses, and chariots everywhere. "Oh, sir, what will we do now?" the young man cried to Elisha.<br>
16 "Don't be afraid!" Elisha told him. "For there are more on our side than on theirs!" <br>
17 Then Elisha prayed, "O Lord, open his eyes and let him see!" The Lord opened the young man's eyes, and when he looked up, he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and chariots of fire.<br>
<br>
The full story was looked at in our Bible Study, Opening Eyes, back on Christian Essays 4.<br>
<br>
Looking again at the KJV of 2 Kings 6, verse 16, Elisha told the servant...<br>
16 ...Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.<br>
<br>
<br>
That reminds of another verse, reminding us that we are children of God, we are overcomers...<br>
1 John 4:4<br>
Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. <br>
<br>
<br>
So, anyway, Jezebel's words did not come true for Elijah.<br>
What became of the evil, wicked woman, Jezebel?<br>
Elijah was not worried, for the Lord told him what was going to become of Jezebel.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 9: verses 1 through 4 -- NLT<br>
1 Meanwhile, Elisha the prophet had summoned a member of the group of prophets. (Bind up your loins and) "Get ready to travel," he told him, "and take this flask of olive oil with you. Go to Ramoth-gilead, <br>
2 and find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi. Call him into a private room away from his friends, <br>
3 and pour the oil over his head. Say to him, 'This is what the Lord says: I anoint you to be the king over Israel.' Then open the door and run for your life!"<br>
4 So the young prophet did as he was told and went to Ramoth-gilead. <br>
<br>
That was verse 4 in the NLT. Now, we will skip down to verse 29 and read it first in the KJV...<br>
2 Kings 9: verses 29 through 37 -- KJV<br>
29 And in the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.<br>
30 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; (and she put her eyes in painting,) and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.<br>
31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?<br>
32 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs (or, chamberlains).<br>
33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.<br>
34 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.<br>
35 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.<br>
36 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, (This is the word of the Lord, which he spake by the hand of his servant Elijah,) This is the word of the Lord, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:<br>
37 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 9 starting in verse 29, we will read it again in the NLT to the end of the chapter, at verse 37.<br>
NLT<br>
29 Ahaziah had become king over Judah in the eleventh year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab.<br>
30 When Jezebel, the queen mother, heard that Jehu had come to Jezreel, she painted her eyelids and fixed her hair and sat at a window. <br>
31 When Jehu entered the gate of the palace, she shouted at him, "Have you come in peace, you murderer? You're just like Zimri, who murdered his master! (Zimri killed his master, King Elah. This is recorded in 1 Kings 16: verses 9 and 10.)<br>
32 Jehu looked up and saw her at the window and shouted, "Who is on my side?" And two or three eunuchs looked out at him. <br>
33 "Throw her down!" Jehu yelled. So they threw her out the window, and her blood spattered against the wall and on the horses. And Jehu trampled her body under his horses' hooves.<br>
34 Then Jehu went into the palace and ate and drank. Afterward he said, "Someone go and bury this cursed woman, for she is the daughter of a king." <br>
35 But when they went out to bury her, they found only her skull, her feet, and her hands.<br>
36 When they returned and told Jehu, he stated, "This fulfils the message from the Lord, which he spoke through his servant Elijah from Tishbe: 'At the plot of land in Jezreel, dogs will eat Jezebel's body. <br>
37 Her remains will be scattered like dung on the plot of land in Jezreel, so that no one will be able to recognise her.'"<br>
<br>
Elijah makes a brief appearance in the New Testament...<br>
<br>
Matthew 17: 2 & 3 (NLT)<br>
2 As the men watched, Jesus' appearance was transformed so that his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light. <br>
3 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and began talking with Jesus.<br>
<br>
Mark 9: 2-4 -- NLT<br>
2 Six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone. As the men watched, Jesus' appearance was transformed, <br>
3 and his clothes became dazzling white, far whiter than any earthly bleach could ever make them. <br>
4 Then Elijah and Moses appeared and began talking with Jesus.<br>
<br>
Another Old Testament story of Elijah is remembered in the book of Romans...<br>
<br>
Romans 11: 2-5 (NLT)<br>
2 No, God has not rejected his own people, whom he chose from the very beginning. Do you realise what the Scriptures say about this? Elijah the prophet complained to God about the people of Israel and said, <br>
3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me, too."<br>
4 And do you remember God's reply? He said, "No, I have 7,000 others who have never bowed down to Baal!"<br>
5 It is the same today, (for a remnant of the people of Israel,) for a few of the people of Israel have remained faithful because of God's grace -- his undeserved kindness in choosing them.<br>
<br>
These parts of the story mentioned here are found in 1 Kings, chapter 19, verses 10, 14 and 18.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As we finish now this Bible study on Elijah, let's look at the final words at the end of the Old Testament...<br>
<br>
Malachi 4:5 (KJV)<br>
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:<br>
<br>
Malachi 4: 4-6 -- NLT<br>
4 "Remember to obey the Law of Moses, my servant -- all the decrees and regulations that I gave him on (Mount Horeb,) Mount Sinai for all Israel.<br>
5 "Look, I am sending you the prophet Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord arrives. <br>
6 His preaching will turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers. Otherwise I will come and strike the land with a curse."<br>

<br>
Four Unknown Heroes<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Elijah and Elisha, both revered prophets in the Bible, exemplified unwavering faith and divine power.<br>
Elijah, known for his dramatic confrontation with the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18), performed numerous miracles, including raising the dead and calling down fire from heaven.<br>
Elisha, his devoted disciple, succeeded him after Elijah was taken up to heaven in a whirlwind (2 Kings 2).<br>
Their relationship was marked by mentorship and spiritual inheritance, as Elisha received a double portion of Elijah's spirit. Following Elijah's departure, Elisha continued the miraculous works, parting the Jordan River (2 Kings 2:14) and telling Naaman how to be healed of leprosy (2 Kings 5).<br>
Their stories, rich with wonders, are primarily found in 1 Kings, chapters 17-19, and in 2 Kings, chapters 2-6.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If Elijah was such a great guy, why did he have to live in land with such a severe food shortage, that he had to have his food delivered to him by unclean Ravens?<br>
If Elisha was such a great guy, why did he have to live in a besieged city where there was such a severe food shortage, that people were starting to eat their own children?<br>
If I am such a great guy, if you are such a wonderful person, being a saved and forgiven believer, why do we have to go through all of these persecutions, sufferings, strugglings and afflictions?<br>
<br>
Do you suppose that the powerfully blessed and Godly Elisha was hungry at that time?  He was suffering and going hungry, right along with the rest of them, being forced to live in a city on lock-down, with people in the city starving to death. I don't think that he was being punished. No, not at all. It was the situation that he was stuck in at that time. Saved, beautiful, valuable, loving followers and believers can also be stuck in horrible situations of suffering, and they did not personally do anything wrong to get there. We are simply trying to receive His blessings in a land that only wants to receive His curses. How do His people get blessed whilst stuck in a world that only desires to be cursed?<br>
<br>
There are many difficult times and circumstances faced by Godly people and prophets in the Bible. We will repeat those first two examples again, here, next, and then think of a few more...<br>
<br>
We recently did a Bible study, titled, Elijah and The God Contest, and in that study, we were talking about 1 Kings 17:2-4: Because of a severe drought and widespread famine, Elijah was fed by ravens, relying solely on God's provision in a time of desperation and scarcity.<br>
<br>
In just a moment, we will read the story about our Four Unknown Heroes in 2 Kings 6-7: Elisha lived in a besieged city, where the people suffered extreme hunger, leading to horrific acts of desperation, including cannibalism, as they faced starvation.<br>
<br>
There is also Jeremiah 20:1-2: The prophet Jeremiah faced persecution and imprisonment by Pashur, the priest, for proclaiming God's message, enduring public humiliation and physical suffering for his faithfulness.<br>
<br>
There is Ezekiel 4:9-17: Ezekiel was commanded to eat a meagre diet of barley cakes cooked over dung, symbolising the dire conditions of the people during the Babylonian siege, reflecting their spiritual and physical degradation.<br>
<br>
In the Book of Job 1:13-19: Job experienced immense personal loss when he lost his children, wealth, and health in a single day, enduring profound grief and suffering whilst maintaining his faith in God.<br>
<br>
Many of you may recall reading in Matthew 4:1-11: Jesus faced temptation in the wilderness for forty days, enduring hunger and spiritual warfare against Satan, demonstrating His reliance on God's Word in a time of trial.<br>
<br>
In the Book of Acts 7:54-60: The first martyr in the New Testament, Stephen, faced violent opposition and was stoned to death for his faith, enduring extreme hostility and ultimately sacrificing his life for the Gospel.<br>
<br>
There is the Hall of Faith, over in Hebrews 11:36-38: Many faithful believers endured mocking, scourging, imprisonment, and even death, living in constant peril and hardship, yet remaining steadfast in their faith throughout history.<br>
<br>
In 1 Peter 4:12-13: The early Christians faced fiery trials and persecution for their faith, experiencing suffering and rejection, yet they were encouraged to rejoice in sharing Christ's sufferings.<br>
<br>
These examples illustrate the profound challenges faced by Godly individuals throughout the Scriptures, highlighting their resilience and faith in the face of adversity.<br>

<br>
2 Kings 6 & 7 KJV<br>
We start in chapter 6, verse 24, and we will keep reading until we get to the end of chapter 7.<br>
24 And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.<br>
25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.<br>
26 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.<br>
27 And he said, (Let not the Lord save thee,) If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?<br>
28 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.<br>
29 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her (on the other day,) on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.<br>
30 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.<br>
31 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.<br>
32 But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?<br>
33 And whilst he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what should I wait for the Lord any longer?<br>
1 Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.<br>
2 (Then a lord which belonged to the king leaning upon his hand answered the man of God.) Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.<br>
3 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?<br>
4 If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.<br>
5 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.<br>
6 For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.<br>
7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.<br>
8 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.<br>
9 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, (we shall find punishment come upon us,) some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household. <br>
10 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.<br>
11 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.<br>
12 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.<br>
13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, (which are left in it,) which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.<br>
14 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.<br>
15 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.<br>
16 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.<br>
17 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.<br>
18 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:<br>
19 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the Lord should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.<br>
20 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 6 & 7 NLT<br>
Again, we begin in chapter 6, verse 24, and we will keep reading right into chapter 7, all the way through, to the end of chapter 7.<br>
<br>
24 ...King Ben-hadad of Aram mustered his entire army and besieged Samaria. <br>
25 As a result, there was a great famine in the city. The siege lasted so long that a donkey's head sold for eighty pieces of silver, and a cup of dove's dung sold for five pieces of silver.<br>
(A donkey's head sold for 80 [shekels] (which is) [2 pounds or 0.9 kilograms] of silver, and 14 of a cab [0.3 litres] of dove's dung sold for 5 [shekels] [2 ounces or 57 grams] (of silver). <br>
(Dove's dung may be a variety of wild vegetable.)<br>
26 One day as the king of Israel was walking along the wall of the city, a woman called to him, "Please help me, my lord the king!"<br>
27 He answered, "If the Lord doesn't help you, what can I do? I have neither food from the threshing floor nor wine from the press to give you." <br>
28 But then the king asked, "What is the matter?"<br>
She replied, "This woman said to me: 'Come on, let's eat your son today, then we will eat my son tomorrow.' <br>
29 So we cooked my son and ate him. Then the next day I said to her, 'Kill your son so we can eat him,' but she has hidden her son."<br>
30 When the king heard this, he tore his clothes in despair. And as the king walked along the wall, the people could see that he was wearing burlap under his robe next to his skin. <br>
31 "May God strike me and even kill me if I don't separate Elisha's head from his shoulders this very day," the king vowed.<br>
32 Elisha was sitting in his house with the elders of Israel when the king sent a messenger to summon him. But before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "A murderer has sent a man to cut off my head. When he arrives, shut the door and keep him out. We will soon hear his master's steps following him."<br>
33 Whilst Elisha was still saying this, the messenger arrived. And the king said, "All this misery is from the Lord! Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?"<br>
1 Elisha replied, "Listen to this message from the Lord! This is what the Lord says: By this time tomorrow in the markets of Samaria, six quarts of choice flour will cost only one piece of silver, and twelve quarts of barley grain will cost only one piece of silver.<br>
(By this time tomorrow in the markets of Samaria, 1 seah [7.3 litres] of choice flour will cost 1 shekel [0.4 ounces or 11 grams] of silver; and 2 seahs [14.6 litres] of barley grain will cost 1 shekel [0.4 ounces or 11 grams] of silver;<br>
2 The officer assisting the king said to the man of God, "That couldn't happen even if the Lord opened the windows of heaven!"<br>
But Elisha replied, "You will see it happen with your own eyes, but you won't be able to eat any of it!"<br>
<br>
(Now there were four men with a contagious skin disease. Where we read in here the English word, leprosy, the Hebrew word used here and throughout this passage can describe various skin diseases, including leprosy.)<br>
<br>
3 Now there were four men with leprosy sitting at the entrance of the city gates. "Why should we sit here waiting to die?" they asked each other. <br>
4 "We will starve if we stay here, but with the famine in the city, we will starve if we go back there. So we might as well go out and surrender to the Aramean army. If they let us live, so much the better. But if they kill us, we would have died anyway."<br>
5 So at twilight they set out for the camp of the Arameans. But when they came to the edge of the camp, no one was there! <br>
6 For the Lord had caused the Aramean army to hear the clatter of speeding chariots and the galloping of horses and the sounds of a great army approaching. "The king of Israel has hired the Hittites and Egyptians (and the people of Muzur, a district near Cilicia,) to attack us!" they cried to one another. <br>
7 So they panicked and ran into the night, abandoning their tents, horses, donkeys, and everything else, as they fled for their lives.<br>
8 When the men with leprosy arrived at the edge of the camp, they went into one tent after another, eating and drinking wine; and they carried off silver and gold and clothing and hid it. <br>
9 Finally, they said to each other, "This is not right. This is a day of good news, and we aren't sharing it with anyone! If we wait until morning, some calamity will certainly fall upon us. Come on, let's go back and tell the people at the palace."<br>
10 So they went back to the city and told the gatekeepers what had happened. "We went out to the Aramean camp," they said, "and no one was there! The horses and donkeys were tethered and the tents were all in order, but there wasn't a single person around!" <br>
11 Then the gatekeepers shouted the news to the people in the palace.<br>
12 The king got out of bed in the middle of the night and told his officers, "I know what has happened. The Arameans know we are starving, so they have left their camp and have hidden in the fields. They are expecting us to leave the city, and then they will take us alive and capture the city."<br>
13 One of his officers replied, "We had better send out scouts to check into this. Let them take five of the remaining horses. If something happens to them, it will be no worse than if they stay here and die with the rest of us."<br>
14 So two chariots with horses were prepared, and the king sent scouts to see what had happened to the Aramean army. <br>
15 They went all the way to the Jordan River, following a trail of clothing and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their mad rush to escape. The scouts returned and told the king about it. <br>
16 Then the people of Samaria rushed out and plundered the Aramean camp. So it was true that six quarts of choice flour were sold that day for one piece of silver, and twelve quarts of barley grain were sold for one piece of silver, just as the Lord had promised. <br>
17 The king appointed his officer to control the traffic at the gate, but he was knocked down and trampled to death as the people rushed out.<br>
So everything happened exactly as the man of God had predicted when the king came to his house. <br>
18 The man of God had said to the king, "By this time tomorrow in the markets of Samaria, six quarts of choice flour will cost one piece of silver, and twelve quarts of barley grain will cost one piece of silver."<br>
19 The king's officer had replied, "That couldn't happen even if the Lord opened the windows of heaven!" And the man of God had said, "You will see it happen with your own eyes, but you won't be able to eat any of it!" <br>
20 And so it was, for the people trampled him to death at the gate!<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The four men with leprosy were just a bunch of unknown, unclean, rejected misfit nobodies.<br>
No one even bothered to record their names into this story.<br>
Yet, as they just went about their day, finding something to do, asking, seeking, knocking, searching for their next meal,<br>
the Lord used them to save many lives, all the lives of the people in Samaria.<br>
The Lord did the miracle and all they had to do was just go and receive the blessing.<br>
The same thing is true for us being able to be saved, forgiven, and live forever with the Lord in heaven.<br>
The Lord Jesus did the miracle, the work on the cross, and all we have to do is to go to Him, believe and receive the blessing.<br>
If the Lord can use people like them, he can use people like us, people like you and me.<br>
Pray to the Lord Jesus, and ask Him, "What do you want me to do for you today?"<br>
What the Lord shows you to do today, do it to the best of your ability, and you'll be blessed, and you will be a blessing for others.<br>
You might even end up saving some lives today as well!<br>
