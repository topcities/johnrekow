Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

In a moment, we will look at a few interesting passages from the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
When we were in Christian Essays 7,<br>
we did a Bible study, titled,<br>
Controlling the Tongue<br>
and in that study, we read<br>
Romans chapter 2, verse 4.<br>
KJV:<br>
4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans chapter 2, verse 4.<br>
NLT:<br>
4 Don't you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?<br>
<br>
<br>
There in verse 4, where the KJV says, the goodness of God,<br>
we looked at that word, goodness, when we were in<br>
Christian Essays 1<br>
when we did the Bible Study, An example of a simple Christian Church Service.<br>
<br>
In that study, we asked this question.<br>
To repent means to change direction. How do we repent?<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (KJV)<br>
...the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.<br>
<br>
Strong's Greek Definition for Goodness comes from the Greek word "chrestos"<br>
which means, kind, easy, better, gracious, fit for use, useful, virtuous, good, benevolent, manageable, mild, pleasant (as opposed to being harsh, hard, sharp or bitter)<br>
<br>
The word, "benevolent" is an interesting word.<br>
<br>
The Chambers 21st Century Dictionary says that benevolent is "showing or involving kindness and generosity... for the benefit of others rather than for profit; charitable."<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (NLT)<br>
...Can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (NIV)<br>
...do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realising that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?<br>
<br>
A form of the word, "benevolent" is something we will see again, here, shortly, in the Eth Cepher, in the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
Back in Christian Essays 13, we had the following Commentary.<br>
Commentary: The seven names of the seven-fold spirit of God are believed to be listed here in Isaiah 11, verse 2.<br>
The spirit of the Lord is the first of the seven spirits listed.<br>
Sevenfold may also be connected with the biblical understanding of the number 7 representing perfection. The "Seven Fold Spirit of God" could be the "perfect" Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 11: 1 & 2 KJV<br>
And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:<br>
<br>
1. And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,<br>
2. the spirit of wisdom<br>
3. and understanding,<br>
4. the spirit of counsel<br>
5. and might,<br>
6. the spirit of knowledge<br>
7. and of the fear of the Lord;<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 11: 1 & 2 NLT<br>
(Out of the stump of the line of Jesse will grow a shoot -- Jesse was King David's father.)<br>
Out of the stump of David's family will grow a shoot --<br>
yes, a new Branch bearing fruit from the old root.<br>
<br>
1. And the Spirit of the Lord will rest on him --<br>
2. the Spirit of wisdom and<br>
3. understanding,<br>
4. the Spirit of counsel and<br>
5. might,<br>
6. the Spirit of knowledge<br>
7. and the fear of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There may be another list of a seven-fold spirit<br>
found in The Book of Enoch.<br>
The English translators are not in agreement on how to number<br>
the chapter numbers and verse numbers.<br>
As a result of this numbering disagreement,<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch chapter 61 verses 8 through 11<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch Chapter 60 verses 10 through 14<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch Chapter 61 verses 10 through 14.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord of spirits and Lord of the spirits, is the Lord of Hosts, and He is<br>
the Master and Lord of Heaven's Angel Armies, known in Hebrew as, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
<br>
The Chosen One, The Elect One is Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck.<br>
The elect ones are the saved believers and followers, the holy set-apart Saints.<br>
The Elect One lives and dwells inside the elect ones.<br>
The light of the world lives and dwells inside the elect ones, making the saved believers and followers the lights of the world.<br>

THE BOOK OF ENOCH:<br>
TRANSLATED FROM THE ETHIOPIC, WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES.<br>
BY REV. George H. Schodde, PH. D.<br>
PROFESSOR IN CAPITAL UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO.<br>
1882 English Translation.<br>
chapter 61 verses 8 through 11<br>
8. And the Lord of the spirits placed his Chosen One on the throne of his glory, and he will judge all the deeds of the holy ones in heaven, and will weigh their deeds on scales.<br>
9. And when he shall raise his countenance to judge their paths that are secret by the word of the name of the Lord of the spirits, and their path in the way of the just judgement of the highest God, then they will all speak with ONE voice, and bless, and praise, and exalt, and glorify the name of the Lord of the spirits.<br>
10. And then will cry out all the host of the heavens, and all the holy ones above, and the host of God, Cherubim and Seraphim and Ophanim, and all the angels of power, and all the angels of supremacies, and the Chosen One, and the other powers on the earth, above the water, on that day;<br>
11. and will raise ONE voice, and will bless, and glorify, and praise, and exalt, in the spirit of faith [fidelity], and in the spirit of wisdom and of patience, and in the spirit of mercy, and in the spirit of judgement and of peace, and in the spirit of goodness, and will all say with ONE voice;<br>
'Blessed is he, and blessed be the name of the Lord of the spirits, in eternity, and to eternity.'<br>

<br>
The Book of Enoch.<br>
Archbishop Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation<br>
Chapter 60 verses 10 through 14<br>
<br>
10. Then the Lord of spirits seated upon the throne of his glory the Elect One;<br>
11. Who shall judge all the works of the holy, in heaven above, and in a balance shall he weigh their actions. And when he shall lift up his countenance to judge their secret ways in the word of the name of the Lord of spirits, and their progress in the path of the righteous judgement of God most high;<br>
12. They shall all speak with united voice; and bless, glorify, exalt, and praise, in the name of the Lord of spirits.<br>
13. He shall call to every power of the heavens, to all the holy above, and to the power of God. The Cherubim, the Seraphim, and the Ophanin, all the angels of power, and all the angels of the Lords, namely, of the Elect One, and of the other Power, who was upon earth over the water on that day,<br>
14. Shall raise their united voice; shall bless, glorify, praise, and exalt with the spirit of faith, with the spirit of wisdom and patience, with the spirit of mercy, with the spirit of judgement and peace, and with the spirit of benevolence; all shall say with united voice:<br>
Blessed is He; and the name of the Lord of spirits shall be blessed for ever and for ever; all, who sleep not, shall bless it in heaven above.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch Chapter 61 verses 10 through 14.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Spirit of Faith<br>
2. Spirit of Wisdom<br>
3. Spirit of Longsuffering<br>
4. Spirit of Mercy<br>
5. Spirit of Judgement<br>
6. Spirit of Peace<br>
7. Spirit of Benevolence<br>
<br>
What does the word, Benevolence, mean?<br>
Referring again to the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries,<br>
in June 2023, we went to those online Dictionaries to look at, combine and merge together their word definitions<br>
for the word, Benevolence.<br>
According to those online Dictionaries, Benevolence means,<br>
kind and generous<br>
wishing good, the desire to do good; kindness; generosity.<br>
an act of kindness or generosity.<br>
the quality of being kind and helpful:<br>
the quality of being kind, helpful and generous<br>
the act of giving or helping<br>
an act of kindness<br>
inclination or tendency to help or do good to others; charity<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next passage gives us an update about what happened to Wisdom.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has three verses.<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has two verses.<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has two verses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has three verses.<br>
Wisdom did not find a place where she might live, and a dwelling-place was given to her in the heavens.<br>
2. Wisdom came to dwell amongst the children of men, and found no dwelling-place; wisdom returned to her place and took her seat amongst the angels.<br>
3. And injustice came forth from its repository; whom it did not seek, them it found, and dwelt with them, like the rain in the desert, and like dew in the thirsty land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has two verses.<br>
1. Wisdom found not a place on earth where she could inhabit; her dwelling therefore is in heaven.<br>
2. Wisdom went forth to dwell amongst the sons of men, but she obtained not an habitation. Wisdom returned to her place, and seated herself in the midst of the angels. But iniquity went forth after her return, who unwillingly found an habitation, and resided amongst them, as rain in the desert, and as a dew in a thirsty land.<br>

<br>
Jeremiah 17: 5 & 6 (KJV)<br>
17:5	Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.<br>
17:6	For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17: 5 & 6 -- NLT<br>
5<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Cursed are those who put their trust in mere humans,<br>
who rely on human strength<br>
and turn their hearts away from the Lord.<br>
6<br>
They are like stunted shrubs in the desert,<br>
with no hope for the future.<br>
They will live in the barren wilderness,<br>
in an uninhabited salty land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:43 (KJV)<br>
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12: 43-45 (NLT)<br>
43 "When an evil (unclean) spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none.<br>
44 Then it says, 'I will return to the person I came from.' So it returns and finds its former home empty, swept, and in order.<br>
45 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before. That will be the experience of this evil generation."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11:24 (KJV)<br>
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.<br>
<br>
Luke 11: 24-26 (NLT)<br>
24 "When an evil (unclean) spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, searching for rest. But when it finds none, it says, 'I will return to the person I came from.'<br>
25 So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order.<br>
26 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next passage talks about a desert, called, Dudel.<br>
Could this desert be the location of the "dry places" where devils and demons go,<br>
when they are rebuked and cast out, and are gone out of a man?<br>
We will find out here, in just a moment. The answer is found...<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 4 through 6<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 6 through 9<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 6 through 9.<br>
<br>
But before we go there, take a look at this...<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
Enoch Chapter 8, verse 1 and 2<br>
1. And Azazel taught mankind to make swords and knives and shields and coats of mail, and taught them to see what was behind them, and their works of art: bracelets and ornaments, and the use of rouge, and the beautifying of the eye-brows, and the dearest and choicest stones and all colouring substances and the metals of the earth.<br>
2. And there was great wickedness and much fornication, and they sinned, and all their ways were corrupt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Different translations spell Azazel's name differently.<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
Enoch Chapter 8, verse 1 and 2<br>
1. Moreover Azazyel taught men to make swords, knives, shields, breastplates, the fabrication of mirrors.<br>
(the fabrication of mirrors was so that it made them see that which was behind them.)<br>
2. Impiety increased; fornication multiplied; and they transgressed and corrupted all their ways, and the workmanship of bracelets and ornaments, the use of paint, the beautifying of the eyebrows, the use of stones of every valuable and select kind, and of all sorts of dyes, so that the world became altered.<br>
<br>
<br>
This one, Azazel, that taught all of this, we will read what happened to him here, next.<br>
He gets sent to a dry place, a desert.<br>
As for this Evil Knowledge he taught,<br>
He had other associates that also taught additional things.<br>
His associates, and what they taught, are also mentioned there in Enoch Chapter 8.<br>
If you want to look at a longer list of this Evil Knowledge that was taught...<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 69<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 68<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 69.<br>
<br>
We have a quickly-made list of that Evil Knowledge<br>
and you can see the compiled list<br>
in the Bible study, titled, Evil Knowledge<br>
which is at the end of Christian Essays 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
Different translations spell his name differently.<br>
<br>
What happened to this one, Azazel, that taught this Evil Knowledge?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 4 through 6<br>
4. And again the Lord spoke to Rufael: "Bind Azazel hand and foot, and put him in the darkness; make an opening in the desert, which is in Dudael, and put him there.<br>
5. And lay upon him rough and pointed rocks, and cover him with darkness that he may remain there forever, and cover his face that he may not see the light!<br>
6. And on the great day of judgement he will be cast into the fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 6 through 9<br>
6. Again the Lord said to Raphael, Bind Azazyel hand and foot; cast him into darkness; and opening the desert which is in Dudael, cast him in there.<br>
7. Throw upon him hurled and pointed stones, covering him with darkness;<br>
8. There shall he remain for ever; cover his face, that he may not see the light.<br>
9. And in the great day of judgement let him be cast into the fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next passage seems to describe the mansions or dwelling places<br>
that we will call home when we get to heaven.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord of spirits and Lord of the spirits, is the Lord of Hosts, and He is<br>
the Master and Lord of Heaven's Angel Armies, known in Hebrew as, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
<br>
The Elect One is Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck.<br>
The elect ones are the saved believers and followers, the holy set-apart Saints,<br>
also known as the just ones, the holy and the elect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
4. And here I saw another vision, the dwellings of the just and the resting-places of the holy.<br>
5. Here my eyes saw their dwellings with the angels, and their resting-places with the holy, and they asked and petitioned and prayed in behalf of the children of men, and justice like water flowed before them, and mercy like dew on the earth; thus it is amongst them to all eternity.<br>
6. And in those days my eyes saw the place of the chosen of justice and of faith [fidelity], and how justice will be in their days, and the just and chosen without number before him to all eternity.<br>
7. And I saw their dwelling under the wings of the Lord of the spirits; and all the just and chosen before him are ornamented as with the light of fire, and their mouths are full of blessings, and their lips praise the name of the Lord of the spirits, and justice before him will not cease.<br>
8. Here I desired to dwell, and my soul longed for this place; here my portion has been before, for such is established concerning me before the Lord of the spirits.<br>
9. And in those days I blessed and exalted the name of the Lord of the spirits with blessings and praise, for he has strengthened me in blessing and praise according to the will of the Lord of the spirits.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
4. There I saw another vision; I saw the habitations and couches of the saints. There my eyes beheld their habitations with the angels, and their couches with the holy ones. They were entreating, supplicating, and praying for the sons of men; whilst righteousness like water flowed before them, and mercy like dew was scattered over the earth.<br>
And thus shall it be with them for ever and for ever.<br>
5. At that time my eyes beheld the dwelling (place)<br>
6. Countless shall be the number of the holy and the elect, (in his presence)<br>
in the presence of God of the elect, of truth, faith, and righteousness.<br>
<br>
7. Their residence I beheld under the wings of the Lord of spirits.<br>
All the holy and the elect sung before him, in appearance like a blaze of fire; their mouths being full of blessings, and their lips glorifying the name of the Lord of spirits. And righteousness incessantly dwelt before him, for ever and for ever.<br>
8. There was I desirous of remaining, and my soul longed for that habitation.<br>
There was my antecedent inheritance; for thus had I prevailed before the Lord of spirits.<br>
(There was my portion before; for thus had it been prevailed respecting me.)<br>
<br>
9. At that time I glorified and extolled the name of the Lord of spirits with blessing and with praise; for he has established it with blessing and with praise, according to his own good pleasure.<br>
(according to the will of the Lord of spirits.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And we see Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck,<br>
assigning our mansions, or dwelling places, to us in this next passage...<br>

3. On that day the chosen One will sit upon the throne of glory, and will choose amongst their deeds [men's deeds] and places without number, and their spirit will become strong in them when they see my Chosen One and those who have called upon my holy and glorious name.<br>
4. And on that day I will cause my Chosen One to dwell amongst them, and will transform heaven and make it a blessing and a light eternally.<br>
5. And I will transform the earth and make it a blessing, and will cause my chosen ones to dwell thereon; and those who have committed sins and crimes will not step on it.<br>
6. For I have seen and satisfied with peace my just ones, and have placed them before me; but for the sinners there awaits before me a judgement, that I may destroy them from the face of the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 45 verses 3 through 5<br>
3. In that day shall the Elect One sit upon a throne of glory; and shall choose their conditions and countless habitations<br>
(whilst their spirits within them shall be strengthened, when they behold my Elect One),<br>
shall choose them for those who have fled for protection to my holy and glorious name.<br>
4. In that day I will cause my Elect One to dwell in the midst of them; will change the face of heaven; will bless it, and illuminate it for ever.<br>
5. I will also change the face of the earth; will bless it; and cause those whom I have elected to dwell upon it.<br>
But those who have committed sin and iniquity shall not inhabit it,<br>
(But those who have committed sin and iniquity shall not tread upon it.)<br>
for I have marked their proceedings. (for I have seen them.)<br>
My righteous ones will I satisfy with peace, placing them before me; but the condemnation of sinners shall draw near, that I may destroy them from the face of the earth.<br>

Psalms 106: 24-26 -- KJV<br>
106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, (a land of desire) they believed not his word:<br>
106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.<br>
106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 11: 1 & 2 -- KJV<br>
11:1 And when the people complained,<br>
(And when the people were as it were complainers, it was evil in the eyes of the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled)<br>
it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt amongst them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.<br>
11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.<br>
(the fire sunk.)<br>
<br>
<br>
And here again is something that we have looked at, when we were half of the way done with Christian Essays 30...<br>
<br>
Numbers 21:4-7 -- KJV<br>
21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom:<br>
and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.<br>
(and the soul of the people was much grieved and shortened because of the way.)<br>
21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.<br>
21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents (saraphim, a saraph or symbolical creature with copper colour) amongst the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.<br>
21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of Enoch also has a warning about those who utter complaints...<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 10 through 13<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 11 through 13<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 11 through 13.<br>
<br>
<br>
To lament is to express sadness, regret, annoyance or disappointment about something you think is unsatisfactory or unfair.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 10 through 13<br>
10. And thus also is one such apartment made for the sinners when they die, and are buried in the earth, without a judgement having been passed upon them during their lives.<br>
11. Here their souls are separated in this great affliction until the great day of judgement and punishment and affliction upon the revilers to eternity, and the vengeance for their souls, and here he binds them to eternity.<br>
12. And if it was before eternity, then this apartment has been made for the souls of those who lament and those who reveal their destruction when they were killed in the days of the sinners.<br>
13. And thus it has been created for the souls of men who were not just, but sinners, who were complete in their crimes; and they will be with criminals like themselves; but their souls will not be killed on the day of judgement and will not be taken from here."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 11 through 13<br>
11. And in the same way likewise are sinners separated when they die, and are buried in the earth; judgement not overtaking them in their lifetime.<br>
12. Here their souls are separated. Moreover, abundant is their suffering until the time of the great judgement, the castigation, (the chastisement, the criticism, the severe punishment) and the torment of those who eternally execrate, (who eternally curse and express strong disapproval or hatred,) whose souls are punished and bound there for ever.<br>
13. And thus has it been front the beginning of the world. (And thus has it been from the beginning of the world.) Thus has there existed a separation between the souls of those who utter complaints, and of those who watch for their destruction, to slaughter them in the day of sinners.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: As we now finish this look at these selected passages from the Book of Enoch, here is one final thought to ponder.<br>
In that last verse, we see...<br>
the souls of those who utter complaints,<br>
and of those who watch for their destruction.<br>
Those who watch for their destruction?<br>
Think about that. We are told to to be sober and watch.<br>
Being a sober watchman is one thing, but maybe, this verse may suggest that being extra worried and fearful of coming destruction can develop into a form of sin.<br>
The Bible does promise that, the fearful shall go into the lake which burneth with fire.<br>
Let us be a vigilant, sober watchmen, without becoming fearful of coming destruction, and may we not have a certain fearful looking for of judgement.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:6 (KJV)<br>
Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 4:7 (KJV)<br>
But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5:8 (KJV)<br>
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:8 (KJV)<br>
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:8 -- NLT<br>
"But cowards, unbelievers, the corrupt, murderers, the immoral, those who practice witchcraft, idol worshipers, and all liars -- their fate is in the fiery lake of burning sulphur. This is the second death."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10: 26-29 (KJV)<br>
10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,<br>
10:27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgement and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.<br>
10:28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:<br>
10:29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10: 26-29 -- NLT<br>
26 Dear friends, if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice that will cover these sins.<br>
27 There is only the terrible expectation of God's judgement and the raging fire that will consume his enemies.<br>
28 For anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.<br>
29 Just think how much worse the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God, and have treated the blood of the covenant, which made us holy, as if it were common and unholy, and have insulted and disdained the Holy Spirit who brings God's mercy to us.<br>

<br>
They Love His Holy Name<br>
<br>
The End of the Book of Enoch is a very interesting area to study.<br>
This is Enoch's last chance to tell the people what he has seen just before is ascends up into heaven.<br>
Jasher Chapter 3 tells us that a fiery, horse-like creature is pacing back and forth up in the sky, waiting for Enoch to finish up his message before transporting him to heaven.<br>
Let's read these last few verses of The End of the Book of Enoch here next.<br>
As you carefully study this, you will see how he sees a hell-like place where sinners go,<br>
and he sees the kingdom of Heaven, where the Saints, the Elect Ones, the holy, set-apart believers, are going.<br>
He looks back and forth, between these two eternal destinations.<br>
Notice carefully how he describes the Saints, the Elect Ones, the holy, set-apart believers.<br>
He describes the how their life has been, and all of the bad things that happened to them, just before they go to heaven.<br>
The believers realise how short and temporary their earthly life is, and the many bad ways how the world has treated them.<br>
They love and prefer the eternal life that is to come more than their temporary life in this physical world.<br>
In spite of all the abuse, they remain clean and pure, and they love His Holy Name, as He leads them home and gives them rest.<br>
You will see all of this and so much more, just in these last few verses of the Book of Enoch. Check it out...<br>

5. And I asked one of the holy angels who were with me, and said to him; "What is this shining thing? for it is not a heaven, but only the flame of a burning fire, and the voice of shouting and crying and lamenting and of great pain."<br>
6. And he said to me: "This place which thou seest -- here are brought the souls of the sinners and of the revilers and of those who do evil and change everything that God speaks through the mouth of the prophets concerning things to take place.<br>
7. For some of these have been written down, and noted above in heaven, that the angels may read and know what will happen to the sinners and to the spirits of the humble who have chastised their bodies, and for that receive their reward from God, and of those who are reviled by wicked men;<br>
8. who loved God, and did not love gold or silver or all the riches of the world, but gave over their bodies to torture;<br>
9. and who, since they existed, did not long for terrestrial food, but considered themselves a breath that passes away, and lived accordingly, and were often tried by God, and their spirits were found in cleanness to praise his name.<br>
10. All the blessings they received I have marked down in the books; and he has destined for them their wages, because they have been shown as those who loved the everlasting heaven more than their life, and whilst they were trodden down by wicked men, and heard abuse and reviling from them, praised me."<br>
11. And now I will call to the spirits of the good, from the generation of light, and change those who were born in darkness, who have not been rewarded in their bodies with honour, as was meet for their fidelity.<br>
12. And I will lead out in a shining light those who love my holy name, and will set each one on the throne of honour, of his honour.<br>
13. And they will glitter in times without number, for justice is the judgement of God, for he will give fidelity to the faithful in the dwellings of the paths of rectitude.<br>
14. And they will see how those who were born in darkness will be cast into darkness, whilst the just will glitter.<br>
15. And the sinners will cry, and see them as they shine; and they will go there where days and times are written for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in the End of the Book of Enoch 105: 23-27<br>
23. He (one of the holy angels) said, There, into that place which thou beholdest, shall be thrust the spirits of sinners and blasphemers; of those who shall do evil, and who shall pervert all which God has spoken by the mouth of the prophets; all which they ought to do.<br>
For respecting these things there shall be writings and impressions above in heaven, that the angels may read them and know what shall happen both to sinners and to the spirits of the humble; to those who have suffered in their bodies, but have been rewarded by God; who have been injuriously treated by wicked men; who have loved God; who have been attached neither to gold nor silver, nor to any good thing in the world, but have given their bodies to torment;<br>
<br>
(To those who from the time they were have not been covetous of earthly riches;)<br>
24. To those who from the period of their birth have not been covetous of earthly riches; but have regarded themselves as a breath passing away.<br>
<br>
(And this have they kept)<br>
25. Such has been their conduct; and much has the Lord tried them; and their spirits have been found pure, that they might bless his name.<br>
All their blessings have I related in a book; and He has rewarded them; for they have been found to love heaven with an everlasting aspiration. God has said, Whilst they have been trodden down by wicked men, they have heard from them revilings and blasphemies; and have been ignominiously treated, whilst they were blessing me. And now will I call the spirits of the good from the generation of light, and will change those who have been born in darkness; who have not in their bodies been recompensed with glory, as their faith may have merited.<br>
26. I will bring them into the splendid light of those who love my holy name: and I will place each of them on a throne of glory, of glory peculiarly his own, and they shall be at rest during unnumbered periods. Righteous is the judgement of God;<br>
<br>
(For to the faithful shall he give faith in the habitations of upright ways.)<br>
27. For to the faithful shall he give faith in the habitations of uprightness. They shall see those, who having been born in darkness unto darkness shall be cast; whilst the righteous shall be at rest. Sinners shall cry out, beholding them, whilst they exist in splendour and proceed forwards to the days and periods prescribed to them.<br>

<br>
The Torah Before Torah<br>
<br>
When we did the Bible study, titled, The Hired and The Prodigal,<br>
which was back in Christian Essays 6,<br>
we had mentioned this little bit of passage from Genesis 19.<br>
<br>
Genesis 19: 5-7 -- KJV<br>
19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.<br>
19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,<br>
19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 19: 5-7 -- NLT<br>
5 They shouted to Lot, "Where are the men who came to spend the night with you? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them!"<br>
6 So Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him.<br>
7 "Please, my brothers," he begged, "don't do such a wicked thing.<br>
<br>
Lot is saying, "don't do such a wicked thing."<br>
Moses had not yet been born, and the Torah, the commandments in the Bible,<br>
had not yet been given out. How did Lot know that it was a wicked thing?<br>
Was there some kind of set of laws, some set of instructions and commandments, some kind of Torah before there was a Torah?<br>
Yes. Was it written down? Maybe, or it was at least taught orally, from generation to generation, until Moses wrote it all down again.<br>
One indication that there was a Torah before there offically was a writen-down Torah, is found in The Book of Jasher.<br>
Can you guess who it was that originally presented this first version of a Torah?<br>
Let's find out!<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of Jasher is not in the Bible anymore.<br>
This English translation is from a Hebrew book printed in 1613.<br>
The paper version was printed and published in Salt Lake City,<br>
by J.H. Parry and Company, in the year 1887.<br>
<br>
The Book of Jasher can be read for free at the following web address, which takes us to the Internet Sacred Text Archive website...<br>

<br>
<br>
Jasher 3: 24-26<br>
24 When at that time Enoch heard this he went and assembled all the inhabitants of the earth, and taught them wisdom and knowledge and gave them divine instructions, and he said to them, I have been required to ascend into heaven, I therefore do not know the day of my going.<br>
25 And now therefore I will teach you wisdom and knowledge and will give you instruction before I leave you, how to act upon earth whereby you may live; and he did so.<br>
26 And he taught them wisdom and knowledge, and gave them instruction, and he reproved them, and he placed before them statutes and judgements to do upon earth, and he made peace amongst them, and he taught them everlasting life, and dwelt with them some time teaching them all these things.<br>

<br>
<br>
The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015)<br>
is an English translation that kept the Hebrew word, "Torah" in their translation.<br>
Here is a very short, incomplete, and very tiny sample of just a few places in the TS2009,<br>
in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament,<br>
where we can appreciate and respect the Torah.<br>
The Hebrew name for God, is Elohim, and it is pronounced, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
(The Eth Cepher spells that same word with a Y instead of a letter I.)<br>
<br>
(John) 1:1 (TS2009)<br>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Elohim, and the Word was Elohim.<br>
<br>
(Romans) 3:31 (TS2009)<br>
Do we then nullify the Torah through the belief? Let it not be! On the contrary, we establish the Torah.<br>
<br>
(Romans) 7:1 (TS2009)<br>
Or do you not know, brothers -- for I speak to those knowing the Torah -- that the Torah rules over a man as long as he lives?<br>
<br>
(Romans) 2:13 (TS2009)<br>
For not the hearers of the Torah are righteous in the sight of Elohim, but the doers of the Torah shall be declared right.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:18 (TS2009)<br>
Open my eyes, that I might see Wonders from Your Torah.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:44 (TS2009)<br>
That I might guard Your Torah continually, Forever and ever;<br>
<br>
Commentary: Torah is the way, the truth and the life...<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:1 (TS2009)<br>
Blessed are the perfect in the way, Who walk in the Torah of Yaw-Who-Wah!<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:142 (TS2009)<br>
Your righteousness is righteousness forever, And Your Torah is truth.<br>
<br>
(Proverbs) 13:14 (TS2009)<br>
The Torah of the wise is a fountain of life, Turning one away from the snares of death.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:163 (TS2009)<br>
I have hated falsehood and loathe it, Your Torah I have loved.<br>
<br>
(Proverbs) 4:2 (TS2009)<br>
For I gave you good instruction: Do not forsake my Torah.<br>
<br>
(John) 7:49 (TS2009)<br>
(The Pharisees said,) "But this crowd that does not know the Torah is accursed."<br>
<br>
(Galatians) 6:2 (TS2009)<br>
Bear one another's burdens, and so complete the Torah of Messiah.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:29 (TS2009)<br>
Remove from me the way of falsehood, And favour me with Your Torah.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:51 (TS2009)<br>
The proud have utterly scorned me, I did not turn aside from Your Torah.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 94:12 (TS2009)<br>
Blessed is the man You discipline, O Yah, And instruct out of Your Torah,<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 37:31 (TS2009)<br>
The Torah of his Elohim is in his heart; His steps do not slide.<br>
<br>
(Romans) 10:4 (TS2009)<br>
For Messiah is the goal of the 'Torah unto righteousness' to everyone who believes.<br>
<br>
(James) 1:25 (TS2009)<br>
But he that looked into the perfect Torah, that of freedom, and continues in it, not becoming a hearer that forgets, but a doer of work, this one shall be blessed in his doing of the Torah.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:34 (TS2009)<br>
Make me understand, that I might observe Your Torah, And guard it with all my heart.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 119:165 (TS2009)<br>
Great peace have those loving Your Torah, And for them there is no stumbling-block.<br>
<br>
(Proverbs) 28:9 (TS2009)<br>
He who turns away his ear from hearing the Torah, Even his prayer is an abomination.<br>
<br>
(Galatians) 3:12 (TS2009)<br>
And the Torah is not of belief, but (as mentioned in Leviticus 18:5) "The man who does them shall live by them."<br>
<br>
(Titus) 3:9 (TS2009)<br>
But keep away from foolish questions, and genealogies, and strife and quarrels about the Torah, for they are unprofitable and useless.<br>

<br>
Worthy<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If He is wanting us to do things for Him, are we worthy enough to accept the task and perform it to completion successfully?<br>
Are we worthy of being His, and belonging to Him?<br>
Are we living in such a way as to be counted worthy?<br>
Are we walking a worthy walk?<br>
Are we living a worthy life?<br>
Are our hearts worthy?<br>
It might be worthy of your time to study these Bible verses that talk about being worthy.<br>
And then, we will conclude by looking at the one who truly is worthy, in the Book of Revelation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 20:3 (KJV)<br>
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<br>

Matthew 10:37 (NLT)<br>
"If you love your father or mother more than you love me, you are not worthy of being mine; or if you love your son or daughter more than me, you are not worthy of being mine.<br>
<br>
<br>

Matthew 10: 37-42 -- KJV<br>
10:37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.<br>
10:38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.<br>
10:39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.<br>
10:40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.<br>
10:41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.<br>
10:42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.<br>
<br>

<br>
Matthew 10: 37-42 -- NLT<br>
37 "If you love your father or mother more than you love me, you are not worthy of being mine; or if you love your son or daughter more than me, you are not worthy of being mine.<br>
38 If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, you are not worthy of being mine.<br>
39 If you cling to your life, you will lose it; but if you give up your life for me, you will find it.<br>
40 "Anyone who receives you receives me, and anyone who receives me receives the Father who sent me.<br>
(If you receive a prophet in the name of a prophet, you will be given the same reward as a prophet.)<br>
41 If you receive a prophet as one who speaks for God, you will be given the same reward as a prophet. And if you receive righteous people because of their righteousness, you will be given a reward like theirs.<br>
42 And if you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers, you will surely be rewarded."<br>

Revelation 5: 6-12 (KJV)<br>
5:6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<br>
5:7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.<br>
5:8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps,<br>
(and golden vials full of incense, which are the prayers of saints)<br>
and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.<br>
5:9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;<br>
5:10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.<br>
5:11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;<br>

(He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God that is sent out into every part of the earth.)<br>
He had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the sevenfold Spirit of God that is sent out into every part of the earth.<br>
7 He stepped forward and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.<br>
8 And when he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp, and they held gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of God's people.<br>
9<br>
And they sang a new song with these words:<br>
"You are worthy to take the scroll<br>
and break its seals and open it.<br>
For you were slaughtered, and your blood has ransomed people for God<br>
from every tribe and language and people and nation.<br>
10<br>
And you have caused them to become<br>
a Kingdom of priests for our God.<br>
And they will reign on the earth."<br>
(And they are reigning on the earth.")<br>
11<br>
Then I looked again, and I heard the voices of thousands and millions of angels around the throne and of the living beings and the elders.<br>
12<br>
And they sang in a mighty chorus:<br>
"Worthy is the Lamb who was slaughtered --<br>
to receive power and riches<br>
and wisdom and strength<br>
and honour and glory and blessing."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

7 And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him sitting on the throne.<br>
8 And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the set-apart ones.<br>
9 And they sang a renewed song, saying, "You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals, because You were slain, and have redeemed us to Elohim by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,<br>
10 and made us sovereigns and priests to our Elohim, and we shall reign upon the earth."<br>
11 And I looked, and I heard the voice of many messengers around the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders. And the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,<br>
12 saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb having been slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and respect and esteem and blessing!"<br>

About 297 miles east of Miami, Florida, are thousands of islands known as, The Bahamas.<br>
And from The Bahamas main island, 36 miles east of there, is a little island,<br>
known as Nassau.<br>
Nassau is the capital and largest city of the islands of The Bahamas surrounding the area.<br>
On this little island, Nassau,<br>
is a Christian church, called, Chapel On The Hill.<br>
A man there, that is serving as an Elder and Youth Director is also the person that manages the Media and Technology for this church, and his name is Moses Pierre-Paul.<br>
He is also the author of an e-book, titled, Input/Output: Change Your Environment, Change Your Life.<br>
and it has been said that this book is a Great testimony of an overcomer.<br>
Moses Pierre-Paul is also the founder of the website, TheWiseBeliever.com.<br>
On his website, he published an article back on the 17th August 2022.<br>
The article is titled, Three Bible Stories of Impatience and Lessons Learnt<br>
<br>
In August of 2023, this article could be found at this Internet address...<br>
<a href="https://thewisebeliever.com/bible-stories-of-impatience-lessons/">https://thewisebeliever.com/bible-stories-of-impatience-lessons/</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Let's begin by reading some selected quotations from this article by Moses Pierre-Paul.<br>
<br>
<br>
Abraham and Sarah are generally a model couple, but their impatience, when it came to having a child, shows us how rushing a process can lead to stress.<br>
<br>
Although God had blessed Abraham and promised to make him a great nation, all that seemed insignificant to Abraham in light of him not having any children.<br>
<br>
As they got older, it seemed more unlikely that they would have a child of their own. So in their impatience, they concluded that it was probably through another woman that they would have the promised child. As a result, Abraham slept with Sarah's servant Hagar.<br>
<br>
Hagar conceived, but when the child was born, it was the start of stress for both Abraham and Sarah. Hagar began to despise Sarah and in turn, Sarah began to cast blame on Abraham for her misery.<br>
<br>
In time, Abraham did have a child through Sarah as God intended, but since they were impatient, they had brought on themselves stress on the path to getting there.<br>
<br>
Although God chose the Israelites to be a blessing to other nations, they had much to work on as individuals. One of those things was patience. In one particular story, their impatience caused them to do something so bad in the sight of God that it made God want to destroy them.<br>
<br>
In the eyes of the Israelites, Moses was taking too long to come down from the mountain and so they told Moses' assistant Aaron:<br>
<br>
"Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."<br>
(Exodus 32:1 NIV)<br>
<br>
<br>
Sensing their impatience, Aaron gave in to their request and used their gold earrings to make them an idol in the form of a golden calf.<br>
<br>
That made God angry and He was prepared to destroy them. Thankfully for them, Moses convinced God to relent from his anger, but in the end, they were still punished. About 3,000 of them died because of actions stemming from impatience (Genesis 32:28).<br>
<br>
A lesson that stands out in the story of the golden calf is that our impatience could cause us to seek inferior substitutes. In the case of the Israelites, Moses' delay led them to find an idol to worship instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And that concludes the selected quotations from the 2022 article by Moses Pierre-Paul.<br>
<br>
Another example of impatience can be seen in Jasher chapter 75.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jasher chapter 75, all of chapter 75, all 22 verses -- from the J.H. Parry and Company 1887 English Translation<br>
1 At that time, in the hundred and eightieth year of the Israelites going down into Egypt, there went forth from Egypt valiant men, thirty thousand on foot, from the children of Israel, who were all of the tribe of Joseph, of the children of Ephraim the son of Joseph.<br>
2 For they said the period was completed which the Lord had appointed to the children of Israel in the times of old, which he had spoken to Abraham.<br>
3 And these men girded themselves, and they put each man his sword at his side, and every man his armour upon him, and they trusted to their strength, and they went out together from Egypt with a mighty hand.<br>
4 But they brought no provision for the road, only silver and gold, not even bread for that day did they bring in their hands, for they thought of getting their provision for pay from the Philistines, and if not they would take it by force.<br>
5 And these men were very mighty and valiant men, one man could pursue a thousand and two could rout ten thousand, so they trusted to their strength and went together as they were.<br>
6 And they directed their course toward the land of Gath, and they went down and found the shepherds of Gath feeding the cattle of the children of Gath.<br>
7 And they said to the shepherds, Give us some of the sheep for pay, that we may eat, for we are hungry, for we have eaten no bread this day.<br>
8 And the shepherds said, Are they our sheep or cattle that we should give them to you even for pay? so the children of Ephraim approached to take them by force.<br>
9 And the shepherds of Gath shouted over them that their cry was heard at a distance, so all the children of Gath went out to them.<br>
<br>
10 And when the children of Gath saw the evil doings of the children of Ephraim, they returned and assembled the men of Gath, and they put on each man his armour, and came forth to the children of Ephraim for battle.<br>
11 And they engaged with them in the valley of Gath, and the battle was severe, and they smote from each other a great many on that day.<br>
12 And on the second day the children of Gath sent to all the cities of the Philistines that they should come to their help, saying,<br>
13 Come up unto us and help us, that we may smite the children of Ephraim who have come forth from Egypt to take our cattle, and to fight against us without cause.<br>
14 Now the souls of the children of Ephraim were exhausted with hunger and thirst, for they had eaten no bread for three days. And forty thousand men went forth from the cities of the Philistines to the assistance of the men of Gath.<br>
15 And these men were engaged in battle with the children of Ephraim, and the Lord delivered the children of Ephraim into the hands of the Philistines.<br>
16 And they smote all the children of Ephraim, all who had gone forth from Egypt, none were remaining but ten men who had run away from the engagement.<br>
<br>
17 For this evil was from the Lord against the children of Ephraim, for they transgressed the word of the Lord in going forth from Egypt, before the period had arrived which the Lord in the days of old had appointed to Israel.<br>
18 And of the Philistines also there fell a great many, about twenty thousand men, and their brethren carried them and buried them in their cities.<br>
19 And the slain of the children of Ephraim remained forsaken in the valley of Gath for many days and years, and were not brought to burial, and the valley was filled with men's bones.<br>
20 And the men who had escaped from the battle came to Egypt, and told all the children of Israel all that had befallen them.<br>
21 And their father Ephraim mourned over them for many days, and his brethren came to console him.<br>
22 And he came unto his wife and she bare a son, and he called his name Beriah, for she was unfortunate in his house.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Abraham was told that all his offspring, which would eventually be known as the Israelites,<br>
would all be living in Egypt for a certain number of years.<br>
Then, they would leave Egypt and all go to the promised land.<br>
Here in Jasher chapter 75, some impatient people thought that it was time to leave Egypt, so they just got up and tried to leave.<br>
They were wrong.<br>
They did not know that there was a future plan for someone named Moses to eventually escort them all out of Egypt.<br>
Did any of these people think to stop and ask and pray to the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah?<br>
Pray to Him, ask him what we should do next. Seek Him first and wait for His answer.<br>
Did Abraham and Sarah pray about it before they decided to help God out by making a baby for them, using Sarah's servant Hagar?<br>
Did Aaron and the Israelites pray about it before deciding to make a gold calf?<br>
Did Lot pray about it before deciding to move to Sodom and Gomorrah?<br>
Let's just say that, the way how the men of Sodom and Gomorrah say hello to each other is not done by using a nice, firm handshake.<br>
Are you going to pray about it before you make a big move or take an important job or make a major financial decision?<br>
<br>
God is Love, Love is patient and kind.<br>
What if God, ELL-Low-Heem, Love and patience are all interconnected?<br>
Choosing not to have patience, means no patience, which equals, no love and no God.<br>
God and love and patience are all connected to each other.<br>
Turning off patience can also turn off love, and can turn you off to God, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
Pray. <br>
Sometimes the answer is, Yes.<br>
Sometimes the answer is, No.<br>
Sometimes the answer is, Wait.<br>
Sometimes His answer is, "Interesting. Let's spend some more time together talking about this and praying about this some more."<br>
Sometimes the answer is, what does the Bible say about this thing you're praying about right now?<br>
Seek Him first, then wait for His answer in His good timing and His due season, not yours.<br>
Not in your season, in His season.<br>
<br>
Psalms 62:1 KJV<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
Ecclesiastes 3:1 KJV<br>
To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:9 KJV<br>
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:9 NLT<br>
So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 1:3 KJV<br>
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither (shall not fade); and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.<br>
<br>
<br>
We now conclude by remembering some verses shared in<br>
the Bible Study about times and seasons,<br>
Which is right after random Bible verse number 501,<br>
on the Parallel Bible Page, which is, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter Zero.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 2:21 (KJV)<br>
and he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:<br>
<br>
Daniel 2:21 (NLT)<br>
He controls the course of world events; he removes kings and sets up other kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the scholars.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 1:7 KJV<br>
...It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.<br>
<br>
Acts 1: 7-9 NLT<br>
7 He replied, "The Father alone has the authority to set those dates and times, and they are not for you to know.<br>
8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere -- in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."<br>
9 After saying this, he was taken up into a cloud while they were watching, and they could no longer see him.<br>

Matthew 16: 24-26 -- Hebrew to English Translation<br>
<br>
Talmidim are the students who learn from their teacher and follow his example.<br>
The Hebrew 'Talmid' is a student who learns from his teacher and follows his example.<br>
"Talmidim" is the masculine plural form.<br>
Talmid is a student, which is a disciple.<br>
Disciples is a plural word which means, students.<br>
<br>
(And then Yaw-Who-Shaw said to his talmidim, (his students, his disciples,)  "Whosoever wants to follow after me -- it is obligated that he should give up hope for himself, and that<br>
he take his warp and woof and follow after me.)<br>
<br>
24 And then Yaw-Who-Shaw said to his students, "Whosoever wants to follow after me is obligated that he should give up hope for himself, and that he take his warp and woof and follow after me.<br>
<br>
(Whosoever wants to follow after me is obligated that he should give up hope for himself, and that<br>
he take his lengthwise and crosswise and follow after me.)<br>
<br>
(lengthwise and crosswise was used in medieval Hebrew to refer to a 'cross.')<br>
<br>
25 For he who wants to save his breath, life or soul in this world can save it, but he will lose it because of me.<br>
<br>
(For he who wants to save his breath, life or soul in this world will save it when he loses it for me.)<br>
<br>
<br>
26 What will it profit a man if he gains all the underground treasures of the world, and the breath, life or soul is lost?<br>
<br>
(What will it profit a man if he gains all the secret treasures of the world, and the breath, life or soul is lost?)<br>
<br>
And what good exchange is the man able to make for his breath, life or soul?<br>

35 And whosoever wants to save his life, (his breath, life, or soul) he will lose it. But he who loses it because of me, and because of the good news, he will save it.<br>

23 Then he said to the crowd, "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross daily, and follow me.<br>
24 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 9: 23-25 -- TS2009<br>
23 And He said to them all, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his stake daily, and follow Me.<br>
24 "For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake shall save it.<br>
25 For what is a man profited if he gains all the world, and is himself destroyed or lost?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 14: 26 & 27 -- KJV<br>
14:26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.<br>
14:27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 14: 26 & 27 -- NLT<br>
26 "If you want to be my disciple, you must, by comparison, hate everyone else -- your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters -- yes, even your own life. Otherwise, you cannot be my disciple.<br>
27 And if you do not carry your own cross and follow me, you cannot be my disciple.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 14: 26 & 27 -- TS2009<br>
<br>
(If anyone comes to Me and does not love less his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and his own life too, he is unable to be My taught one.)<br>
<br>
26 If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and his own life too, he is unable to be My taught one.<br>
27 "And whoever does not bear his stake and come after Me is unable to be My taught one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What we have just looked at here in Luke 14: 26 & 27,<br>
this concept of hating the world,<br>
could be poinitng to something found at the End of the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the Bible study that we did earlier, here on this page, here in Christian Essays 33, titled,<br>
They Love His Holy Name<br>
<br>
we saw something there that this could be referring to in the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
Loving ELL-Low-Heem more, and loving everything else in the world less.<br>
Here is part of that again.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found at the End of the Book of Enoch 108: 8 & 9<br>
8. who loved God, and did not love gold or silver or all the riches of the world, but gave over their bodies to torture;<br>
9. and who, since they existed, did not long for terrestrial food, but considered themselves a breath that passes away, and lived accordingly, and were often tried by God, and their spirits were found in cleanness to praise his name.<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found at the End of the Book of Enoch 105: 23-26<br>
...the spirits of the humble; to those who have suffered in their bodies, but have been rewarded by God; who have been injuriously treated by wicked men; who have loved God; who have been attached neither to gold nor silver, nor to any good thing in the world, but have given their bodies to torment;<br>
<br>
(To those who from the time they were have not been covetous of earthly riches;)<br>
24. To those who from the period of their birth have not been covetous of earthly riches; but have regarded themselves as a breath passing away.<br>
<br>
(And this have they kept)<br>
25. Such has been their conduct; and much has the Lord tried them; and their spirits have been found pure, that they might bless his name.<br>
All their blessings have I related in a book; and He has rewarded them; for they have been found to love heaven with an everlasting aspiration. God has said, Whilst they have been trodden down by wicked men, they have heard from them revilings and blasphemies; and have been ignominiously treated, whilst they were blessing me. And now will I call the spirits of the good from the generation of light, and will change those who have been born in darkness; who have not in their bodies been recompensed with glory, as their faith may have merited.<br>
26. I will bring them into the splendid light of those who love my holy name: and I will place each of them on a throne of glory, of glory peculiarly his own, and they shall be at rest during unnumbered periods. Righteous is the judgement of God;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Right after Jesus gets all done talking about<br>
evil spirits entering into a person and living inside someone and controlling someone,<br>
right at that moment, a woman in the crowd suddenly says this...<br>
<br>
Luke 11:27 & 28 -- KJV<br>
11:27 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.<br>
11:28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11:27 & 28 -- NLT<br>
27 As he was speaking, a woman in the crowd called out, "God bless your mother -- the womb from which you came, and the breasts that nursed you!"<br>
28 Jesus replied, "But even more blessed are all who hear the word of God and put it into practice."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11:27 & 28 -- TS2009<br>
27 And it came to be, as He was saying this, a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, "Blessed is the womb that bore You, and the breasts which You sucked!"<br>
28 But He said, "Blessed rather are those hearing the Word of ELL-Low-Heem and watching over it!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What are the very last words that Jesus' mother says in the Bible?<br>
Her final and last words are in John 2:5.<br>
She points to his son, Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, and she tells the servants this...<br>
<br>
John 2:5 -- KJV<br>
His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 2:5 -- NLT<br>
But his mother told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."<br>
<br>
John 2:5 -- TS2009<br>
His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever He says to you."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you His servant, His good and faithful servant?<br>
Do whatever he tells you.<br>
The Bible does not tell us to pray to Mary.<br>
The Bible never told you to do that, ever!<br>
The Bible does not tell us to pray to Mary, but please follow her final advice!<br>
Do whatever Yaw-Who-Shaw tells you.<br>
Obey Yaw-Who-Shaw, study and obey your Bible!<br>
<br>

Commentary: In early August of 2023, our family was going through a long and difficult season, more than two years, and counting, with no idea on how much longer and when or if things would get better, or not. The kind of thoughts and feelings that can be stirring in one's heart, mind and soul, in seasons of affliction, can be difficult to put into words. One morning, my wife, decided to open up her Eth Cepher to a random page, and she just happened to land on Psalms 77.<br>
<br>
The kinds of questions and thoughts of doubt, difficult to say or pray, were all right there in Psalms 77.  It validated the feelings that one might have in stressful, uncertain times of difficulty. And then, just a couple of days later, on the first Sabbath (Shuh-Bot) day of rest in August 2023, we all decided to watch, for the first time, The Chosen TV Series, Season 3, Episode 8.  And, guess what! Episode 8 starts off with Asaph reading Psalms 77.<br>
<br>
With all of that, this Bible study just happens to feature some verses that just might be referencing some of the content and scenes in The Chosen TV Series, Season 3, Episode 8. Let's begin by reading Psalms 77. You also just might find some things in there that seem to be talking about some of the things that you have been going through, and the questions and doubts that might come across the minds, hearts and souls of believers everywhere, all around the world.<br>
<br>
I'd rather not say it or pray it quite like that, but there it is, anyway. It validates our feelings. He gets us. He's got this. Don't give up.<br>
<br>

Psalms 77,<br>
All of Psalms 77, all 20 verses -- KJV<br>
77:1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.<br>
<br>
77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord:<br>
(my hand ran in the night,)<br>
my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.<br>
<br>
77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.<br>
77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.<br>
77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.<br>
77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.<br>
77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?<br>
<br>
77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?<br>
(doth his promise fail to generation and generation?)<br>
<br>
77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.<br>
77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.<br>
77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.<br>
77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.<br>
77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?<br>
77:14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength amongst the people.<br>
77:15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.<br>
77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.<br>
(The clouds were poured forth with water:)<br>
77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.<br>
<br>
77:18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.<br>
77:19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.<br>
77:20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.<br>

Psalms 77,<br>
All of Psalms 77, all 20 verses -- NLT<br>
For Jeduthun, the choir director: A psalm of Asaph.<br>
1<br>
I cry out to God; yes, I shout.<br>
Oh, that God would listen to me!<br>
2<br>
When I was in deep trouble,<br>
I searched for the Lord.<br>
All night long I prayed, with hands lifted toward heaven,<br>
but my soul was not comforted.<br>
3<br>
I think of God, and I moan,<br>
overwhelmed with longing for his help.<br>
Interlude<br>
4<br>
You don't let me sleep.<br>
I am too distressed even to pray!<br>
5<br>
I think of the good old days,<br>
long since ended,<br>
6<br>
when my nights were filled with joyful songs.<br>
I search my soul and ponder the difference now.<br>
7<br>
Has the Lord rejected me forever?<br>
Will he never again be kind to me?<br>
8<br>
Is his unfailing love gone forever?<br>
Have his promises permanently failed?<br>
9<br>
Has God forgotten to be gracious?<br>
Has he slammed the door on his compassion?<br>
Interlude<br>
10<br>
And I said, "This is my fate;<br>
the Most High has turned his hand against me."<br>
11<br>
But then I recall all you have done, O Lord;<br>
I remember your wonderful deeds of long ago.<br>
12<br>
They are constantly in my thoughts.<br>
I cannot stop thinking about your mighty works.<br>
13<br>
O God, your ways are holy.<br>
Is there any god as mighty as you?<br>
14<br>
You are the God of great wonders!<br>
You demonstrate your awesome power amongst the nations.<br>
15<br>
By your strong arm, you redeemed your people,<br>
the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.<br>
Interlude<br>
16<br>
(When the waters saw you, O God,)<br>
When the Red Sea saw you, O God,<br>
its waters looked and trembled!<br>
The sea quaked to its very depths.<br>
17<br>
The clouds poured down rain;<br>
the thunder rumbled in the sky.<br>
Your arrows of lightning flashed.<br>
18<br>
Your thunder roared from the whirlwind;<br>
the lightning lit up the world!<br>
The earth trembled and shook.<br>
19<br>
Your road led through the sea,<br>
your pathway through the mighty waters --<br>
a pathway no one knew was there!<br>
20<br>
You led your people along that road like a flock of sheep,<br>
with Moses and Aaron as their shepherds.<br>

Psalms 77,<br>
All of Psalms 77, all 20 verses -- TS2009<br>
1 My voice is to ELL-Low-Heem, and I cry; My voice is to ELL-Low-Heem, and He listened to me.<br>
2 In the day of my distress I sought Yaw-Who-Wah; My hand was stretched out in the night And it did not cease, My being refused to be comforted.<br>
3 I remembered ELL-Low-Heem, and groaned; I complained, and my spirit grew faint. Selah.<br>
4 You ceased the watches of my eyes, I was too troubled to speak.<br>
5 I have thought about the days of old, The years long past.<br>
6 I remember my song in the night, I meditate within my heart, And my spirit searches diligently.<br>
7 Would Yaw-Who-Wah reject forever, And never again be pleased?<br>
8 Has His loving-commitment ceased forever, Has the promise failed for all generations?<br>
9 Has ELL forgotten to show favour? Has He shut up His compassions in displeasure? Selah.<br>
10 And I said, "This is my grief: That the right hand of the Most High has changed."<br>
11 I remember the deeds of Yah, For I remember Your wonders of old.<br>
12 And I shall meditate on all Your work, And talk of Your deeds.<br>
13 Your way, O ELL-Low-Heem, is in Set-apartness; Who is a great ELL like ELL-Low-Heem?<br>
14 You are the ELL who does wonders; You have made known Your strength amongst the peoples.<br>
15 By Your arm You have redeemed Your people, The sons of Yah-Coab and Yoh-Sef. Selah.<br>
16 The waters saw You, O ELL-Low-Heem; The waters saw You, they were afraid; The depths also trembled.<br>
17 The clouds poured out water; The heavens rumbled; Also, Your arrows flashed back and forth.<br>
18 The voice of Your thunder rolled along; Lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.<br>
19 Your way was in the sea, And Your path in the great waters, And Your footsteps were not known.<br>
20 You did lead Your people like a flock By the hand of Moe-Shay and Aharon.<br>

Psalms 107: 1-9 (KJV)<br>
107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.<br>
107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;<br>
107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.<br>
(and from the sea.)<br>
107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.<br>
107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.<br>
107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.<br>
107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.<br>

Tell others he has redeemed you from your enemies.<br>
3<br>
For he has gathered the exiles from many lands,<br>
from east and west,<br>
from north and south (and sea).<br>
4<br>
Some wandered in the wilderness,<br>
lost and homeless.<br>
5<br>
Hungry and thirsty,<br>
they nearly died.<br>
6<br>
"Lord, help!" they cried in their trouble,<br>
and he rescued them from their distress.<br>
7<br>
He led them straight to safety,<br>
to a city where they could live.<br>
8<br>
Let them praise the Lord for his great love<br>
and for the wonderful things he has done for them.<br>
9<br>
For he satisfies the thirsty<br>
and fills the hungry with good things.<br>
<br>

3 And gathered out of the lands, From east and from west, From north and from south.<br>
4 They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert way; They found no city to dwell in.<br>
5 Hungry and thirsty, Their being in them grew faint.<br>
6 Then they cried out to Yaw-Who-Wah in their distress, He delivered them out of their troubles.<br>
7 And He guided them by the right way, To go to a city to settle.<br>
8 Let them give thanks to Yaw-Who-Wah for His loving-commitment, And His wonders to the children of men!<br>

Next, we go to the book of John, and we read what sounds like a different story with a different ending...<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6: 19-21 (KJV)<br>
6:19 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.<br>
6:20 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.<br>
6:21 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6: 19-21 -- NLT<br>
(They had rowed 25 or 30 stadia, which is 4.6 or 5.5 kilometres,)<br>
19 They had rowed three or four miles when suddenly they saw Jesus walking on the water toward the boat. They were terrified,<br>
(But he called out to them, I am. The 'I Am' is here.)<br>
20 but he called out to them, "Don't be afraid. I am here!"<br>
21 Then they were eager to let him in the boat, and immediately they arrived at their destination!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

(When they had rowed about 5 to 6 kilometres, or, 3 to 4 miles,)<br>
19 When they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Yaw-Who-Shaw walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid.<br>

21 They wished therefore to take Him into the boat, and at once the boat was at the land where they were going.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
James 4:7 (KJV)<br>
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: paraphrase of a part of verse 9 (NLT)<br>
Stand firm against (your great enemy, the devil,) and be strong in your faith.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5:9 (KJV)<br>
whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: end of verse 9 (NLT)<br>
...Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
It does not say, families...are going through....<br>
It says, family...is going through.<br>
We are all one single family of many believers all over the world.<br>
We are different body parts of one single body, with the Messiah being the head of this one single body, this one single family.<br>
In the English translations, the saved believers that are going to heaven are all part of one single, big family.<br>
These family members are known as, brothers and sisters, and they are sometimes just called, brothers or brethren.<br>
<br>
The Bible also teaches that, of the saved believers that are going to heaven, there are only a small number of them.<br>
Most people are not going to heaven. Only a small number are the saved believers that are going to heaven.<br>
As for those saved believers that are going to heaven, the bible promises them a life of difficulty, troubles, trials, tribulations, persecutions, afflictions and sufferings, here in this world, before they go to heaven.<br>
The evil spirits of darkness living in the unbelievers hate the light that lives in the saved believers.<br>
The people going to hell hate the the saved believers that are going to heaven.<br>
Here are some of the Bible verses that tell us all of this...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: 8 & 9 (NLT)<br>
8 Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.<br>
9 Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.<br>
(Remember that your brotherhood all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.)<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5: 8 & 9 -- KJV<br>
5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br>
5:9 Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<br>
<br>
Once again...<br>
James 4:7 (KJV)<br>
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
<br>
James 4:7 (NLT)<br>
So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br>
<br>
James 4:7 -- TS2009<br>

James 4: 11 & 12 (KJV)<br>
4:11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.<br>
4:12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?<br>
<br>
<br>
James 4: 11 & 12 -- NLT<br>
11 Don't speak evil against each other, dear brothers and sisters. If you criticise and judge each other, then you are criticising and judging God's law. But your job is to obey the law, not to judge whether it applies to you.<br>
12 God alone, who gave the law, is the Judge. He alone has the power to save or to destroy. So what right do you have to judge your neighbour?<br>
<br>
<br>
James 4: 11 & 12 -- TS2009<br>
11 Brothers, do not speak against one another. He that speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against Torah and judges Torah. And if you judge Torah, you are not a doer of Torah but a judge.<br>
12 There is one Lawgiver and Judge, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another?<br>

1 John 3:13 (KJV)<br>
Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 3: 13-18 (KJV)<br>
3:13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.<br>
3:14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.<br>
3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.<br>
3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.<br>
3:17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?<br>
3:18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 3: 13-18 -- NLT<br>
13 So don't be surprised, dear brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.<br>
(If we love our brothers,)<br>
14 If we love our brothers and sisters who are believers, it proves that we have passed from death to life. But a person who has no love is still dead.<br>
15 Anyone who hates another brother or sister is really a murderer at heart. And you know that murderers don't have eternal life within them.<br>
16 We know what real love is because Jesus gave up his life for us. So we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters.<br>
17 If someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister in need but shows no compassion -- how can God's love be in that person?<br>
18 Dear children, let's not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 3: 13-19 -- TS2009<br>
13 Do not marvel, my brothers, if the world hates you.<br>
14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. The one not loving his brother stays in death.<br>
15 Everyone hating his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has everlasting life staying in him.<br>
16 By this we have known love, because He laid down His life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.<br>
17 But whoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his tender affections from him, how does the love of Elohim stay in him?<br>
18 My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.<br>
19 And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall set our hearts at rest before Him,<br>

<br>
Revelation 2:10 -- NLT<br>

Hebrews 11: 24-27 -- KJV<br>
24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;<br>

(esteeming the reproach for Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt:)<br>
26 esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.<br>
27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 11: 24-27 -- NLT<br>
24 It was by faith that Moses, when he grew up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.<br>
25 He chose to share the oppression of God's people instead of enjoying the fleeting pleasures of sin.<br>
26 He thought it was better to suffer for the sake of Christ than to own the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his great reward.<br>
27 It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt, not fearing the king's anger. He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible.<br>

24 By belief, Moe-Shay, having become great, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh,<br>

26 deeming the reproach of Messiah greater riches than the treasures in (Egypt) Mitsrayim (Meets-Rye-EEm), for he was looking to the reward.<br>
27 By belief, he left (Egypt) Mitsrayim, not fearing the wrath of the sovereign, for he was steadfast, as seeing Him who is invisible.<br>

15:17 These things I command you, that ye love one another.<br>
15:18 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.<br>

2 Thessalonians 1: 3-10 KJV<br>
3 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;<br>
4 so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:<br>
5 which is a manifest token of the righteous judgement of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:<br>
6 seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;<br>
<br>
7 and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,<br>
(and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power,)<br>
(in flaming fire yielding vengeance on them that know not God,)<br>
8 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:<br>
<br>
9 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;<br>
10 when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony amongst you was believed) in that day.<br>

<br>
2 Thessalonians 1: 3-11 -- NLT<br>
3 Dear brothers and sisters, we can't help but thank God for you, because your faith is flourishing and your love for one another is growing.<br>
4 We proudly tell God's other churches about your endurance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and hardships you are suffering.<br>
5 And God will use this persecution to show his justice and to make you worthy of his Kingdom, for which you are suffering.<br>
6 In his justice he will pay back those who persecute you.<br>
7 And God will provide rest for you who are being persecuted and also for us when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven. He will come with his mighty angels,<br>
8 in flaming fire, bringing judgement on those who don't know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus.<br>
9 They will be punished with eternal destruction, forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power.<br>
10 When he comes on that day, he will receive glory from his holy people -- praise from all who believe. And this includes you, for you believed what we told you about him.<br>
11 So we keep on praying for you, asking our God to enable you to live a life worthy of his call. May he give you the power to accomplish all the good things your faith prompts you to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 1: 3-12 -- TS2009<br>
3 We ought to give thanks to Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem) always for you, brothers, as it is proper, because your belief grows exceedingly, and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing,<br>
4 so that we ourselves boast of you amongst the assemblies of Elohim for your endurance and belief in all your persecutions and afflictions which you are bearing,<br>
5 clear evidence of the righteous judgement of Elohim, in order for you to be counted worthy of the reign of Elohim, for which you also suffer,<br>
6 since Elohim shall rightly repay with affliction those who afflict you,<br>
7 and to give you who are afflicted rest with us when the Master Yaw-Who-Shaw is revealed from heaven with His mighty messengers,<br>
8 in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know Elohim, and on those who do not obey the Good News of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck,<br>
9 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Master and from the esteem of His strength,<br>
10 when He comes to be esteemed in His set-apart ones and to be admired amongst all those who believe in that Day, because our witness to you was believed.<br>
11 To this end we always pray for you that our Elohim would count you worthy of this calling, and complete all the good pleasure of goodness, and the work of belief with power,<br>
12 so that the Name of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck is esteemed in you, and you in Him, according to the favour of our Elohim and the Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck.<br>

1 Peter 1: 3-11 KJV<br>
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
(which according to his much mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope)<br>
which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,<br>
<br>
4 to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,<br>
(reserved in heaven for us,)<br>
5 who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.<br>
6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:<br>
7 that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:<br>
8 whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:<br>
9 receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.<br>
10 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:<br>
11 searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1: 3-11 -- NLT<br>
3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is by his great mercy that we have been born again, because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Now we live with great expectation,<br>
4 and we have a priceless inheritance -- an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay.<br>
5 And through your faith, God is protecting you by his power until you receive this salvation, which is ready to be revealed on the last day for all to see.<br>
(So you are truly glad.)<br>
6 So be truly glad. There is wonderful joy ahead, even though you must endure many trials for a little while.<br>
7 These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold -- though your faith is far more precious than mere gold. So when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you much praise and glory and honour on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world.<br>
8 You love him even though you have never seen him. Though you do not see him now, you trust him; and you rejoice with a glorious, inexpressible joy.<br>
9 The reward for trusting him will be the salvation of your souls.<br>
10 This salvation was something even the prophets wanted to know more about when they prophesied about this gracious salvation prepared for you.<br>
11 They wondered what time or situation the Spirit of Christ within them was talking about when he told them in advance about Christ's suffering and his great glory afterward.<br>

1 Peter 1: 3-11 -- TS2009<br>
3 Blessed be the Elohim and Father of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck, who according to His great compassion has caused us to be born again to a living expectation through the resurrection of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck from the dead,<br>
4 to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, having been kept in the heavens for you,<br>
5 who are protected by the power of Elohim through belief, for a deliverance ready to be revealed in the last time,<br>
6 in which you exult, even though for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by manifold trials,<br>
7 in order that the proving of your belief  --  much more precious than gold that perishes, and proven by fire -- might be found to result in praise and respect and esteem at the revelation of Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck,<br>
8 whom having not seen, you love; in whom you exult with unspeakable and esteemed joy, yet not seeing, but believing,<br>
9 obtaining the goal of your belief: a deliverance of lives.<br>
10 Concerning this deliverance the prophets have sought out and searched out, prophesying concerning the favour for you,<br>
11 searching to know what, or what sort of time, the Spirit which was in them was pointing out concerning Messiah (Muh-Shee-Uck), when it was bearing witness beforehand the sufferings of Messiah, and the esteems that would follow,<br>
<br>

2 Corinthians 1: 3-6 KJV<br>
3 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;<br>
4 who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.<br>
5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.<br>
6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation,<br>
(which is wrought in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:)<br>
which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 3-6 -- NLT<br>
3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is our merciful Father and the source of all comfort.<br>
4 He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others. When they are troubled, we will be able to give them the same comfort God has given us.<br>
5 For the more we suffer for Christ, the more God will shower us with his comfort through Christ.<br>
6 Even when we are weighed down with troubles, it is for your comfort and salvation! For when we ourselves are comforted, we will certainly comfort you. Then you can patiently endure the same things we suffer.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 3-7 -- TS2009<br>
3 Blessed be the Elohim and Father of our Master Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck, the Father of compassion and Elohim of all comfort,<br>
4 who is comforting us in all our pressure, enabling us to comfort those who are in every pressure, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by Elohim.<br>
5 Because, as the sufferings of Messiah overflow in us, so our comfort also overflows through Messiah (Muh-Shee-Uck).<br>
6 And if we suffer pressure, it is for your comfort and deliverance, being worked out in enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort and deliverance.<br>
7 And our expectation for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are sharing in the sufferings  --  so also in the comfort.<br>

Matthew 7:14 (NLT)<br>
...the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult,....<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 13 & 14 (NLT)<br>
13 "You can enter God's Kingdom only through the narrow gate.<br>
(The road that leads to destruction is broad,)<br>
The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.<br>
14 But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 13 & 14 -- KJV<br>
7:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:<br>
7:14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 13 & 14 -- TS2009<br>
13 "Enter in through the narrow gate! Because the gate is wide -- and the way is broad -- that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter in through it.<br>
<br>
("Because the gate is narrow and the way is afflicted which leads to life,)<br>
14 "Because the gate is narrow and the way is hard pressed which leads to life, and there are few who find it.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14:6 -- TS2009<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw said to him, "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.<br>

<br>
Throughout the ages<br>
Before the dawn of space and time<br>
That's when You knew me<br>
A perfect image in Your mind<br>
<br>
But I was broken<br>
When I fell short of Your design<br>
So You descended<br>
To be great in my life<br>
<br>
Great in power and glory<br>
Great in majesty divine<br>
Great in Your salvation,<br>
Be great in my life<br>
<br>
Great in love and mercy<br>
Great in perfect sacrifice<br>
Great in resurrection,<br>
Be great in my life<br>
<br>
There is a city<br>
Shining high above the stars<br>
You call me closer<br>
To discover who You are<br>
<br>
This is my purpose<br>
That I would know the risen Christ<br>
So let Your kingdom,<br>
Be great in my life<br>
<br>
Great in power and glory<br>
Great in majesty divine<br>
Great in Your salvation,<br>
Be great in my life<br>
<br>
Great in love and mercy<br>
Great in perfect sacrifice<br>
Great in resurrection,<br>
Be great in my life<br>
<br>
Now and forever glorified<br>
Now and forever, Lord, be great in my life<br>
Now and forever glorified<br>
Now and forever, Lord, be great in my life<br>

You are great in power and glory<br>
Great in majesty divine<br>
Great in Your salvation, be great in my life<br>
You are great in love and mercy<br>
Great in perfect sacrifice<br>

In my life<br>

In my life<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember those walls that we called sin and shame<br>
They were like prisons that we couldn't escape<br>
But He came and He died and He rose<br>
Those walls are rubble now<br>
<br>
Remember those giants we called death and grave<br>
They were like mountains that stood in our way<br>
But He came and He died and He rose<br>
Those giants are dead now<br>
<br>
This is our God<br>
This is who He is<br>
He loves us<br>
This is our God<br>
This is what He does<br>
He saves us<br>
He bore the cross<br>
Beat the grave<br>
Let heaven and earth proclaim<br>
This is our God<br>
King Jesus<br>
<br>
Remember that fear that took our breath away<br>
Faith so weak that we could barely pray<br>
But He heard every word, every whisper<br>
<br>
Now those altars in the wilderness<br>
Tell the story of His faithfulness<br>
Never once did He fail and He never will<br>
<br>
<br>
This is our God<br>
This is who He is<br>
He loves us<br>
This is our God<br>
This is what He does<br>
He saves us<br>
He bore the cross<br>
Beat the grave<br>
Let heaven and earth proclaim<br>
This is our God<br>
King Jesus<br>
<br>
<br>
Who pulled me out of that pit<br>
He did, He did<br>
Who paid for all of our sin<br>
Nobody but Jesus<br>
<br>
Who pulled me out of that pit<br>
He did, He did<br>
Who paid for all of our sin<br>
Nobody but Jesus<br>
<br>
Who rescued me from that grave<br>
Yahweh, Yahweh<br>
Who gets the glory and praise<br>
Nobody but Jesus<br>
<br>
Who rescued me from that grave<br>
Yahweh, Yahweh<br>
Who gets the glory and praise<br>
Nobody but Him<br>
<br>
<br>
This is our God<br>
This is who He is<br>
He loves us<br>
This is our God<br>
This is what He does<br>
He saves us<br>
He bore the cross<br>
Beat the grave<br>
Let heaven and earth proclaim<br>
This is our God<br>
King Jesus<br>
<br>
He bore the cross<br>
Beat the grave<br>
Let heaven and earth proclaim<br>
This is our God<br>

In Acts 14, Paul and Barnabas preach in Iconium,<br>
then they go to Lystra and Derbe.<br>
When Paul and Barnabas Return to Antioch of Syria, they preach this message...<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 14: 21-23 -- KJV<br>
14:21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,<br>
14:22 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.<br>
14:23 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts of the Apostles 14: 21-23 -- NLT<br>
21 After preaching the Good News in Derbe and making many disciples, Paul and Barnabas returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch of Pisidia,<br>
22 where they strengthened the believers. They encouraged them to continue in the faith, reminding them that we must suffer many hardships to enter the Kingdom of God.<br>
23 Paul and Barnabas also appointed elders in every church. With prayer and fasting, they turned the elders over to the care of the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 14: 21-23 -- TS2009<br>
21 And having brought the Good News to that city, and having made many taught ones, they returned to Lustra, and Ikonion, and Antioch,<br>
22 strengthening the beings of the taught ones, encouraging them to continue in the belief, and that through many pressures we have to enter the reign of Elohim.<br>
23 And having appointed elders in every assembly, having prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Master in whom they had believed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If we summarise verse 22, as it was seen in these three English translations,<br>
They were strengthening the students, which are known as the disciples.<br>
They were students that were studying the Bible, studying and learning and doing what the Bible says.<br>
They were strengthening the students, making the students stronger.<br>
They were encouraging these students to continue in their belief and faith, reminding them that<br>
we must go through many tribulations, many sufferings, many hardships, and many pressures to enter into the reign and Kingdom of ELL-Low-Heem, the Kingdom of Heaven, the Kingdom of God.<br>
