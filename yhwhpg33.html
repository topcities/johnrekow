Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

In a moment, we will look at a few interesting passages from the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
When we were in Christian Essays 7,<br>
we did a Bible study, titled,<br>
Controlling the Tongue<br>
and in that study, we read<br>
Romans chapter 2, verse 4.<br>
KJV:<br>
4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans chapter 2, verse 4.<br>
NLT:<br>
4 Don't you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?<br>
<br>
<br>
There in verse 4, where the KJV says, the goodness of God,<br>
we looked at that word, goodness, when we were in<br>
Christian Essays 1<br>
when we did the Bible Study, An example of a simple Christian Church Service.<br>
<br>
In that study, we asked this question.<br>
To repent means to change direction. How do we repent?<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (KJV)<br>
...the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.<br>
<br>
Strong's Greek Definition for Goodness comes from the Greek word "chrestos"<br>
which means, kind, easy, better, gracious, fit for use, useful, virtuous, good, benevolent, manageable, mild, pleasant (as opposed to being harsh, hard, sharp or bitter)<br>
<br>
The word, "benevolent" is an interesting word.<br>
<br>
The Chambers 21st Century Dictionary says that benevolent is "showing or involving kindness and generosity... for the benefit of others rather than for profit; charitable."<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (NLT)<br>
...Can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?<br>
<br>
Romans 2:4 (NIV)<br>
...do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realising that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?<br>
<br>
A form of the word, "benevolent" is something we will see again, here, shortly, in the Eth Cepher, in the Book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
Back in Christian Essays 13, we had the following Commentary.<br>
Commentary: The seven names of the seven-fold spirit of God are believed to be listed here in Isaiah 11, verse 2.<br>
The spirit of the Lord is the first of the seven spirits listed.<br>
Sevenfold may also be connected with the biblical understanding of the number 7 representing perfection. The "Seven Fold Spirit of God" could be the "perfect" Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 11: 1 & 2 KJV<br>
And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:<br>
<br>
1. And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,<br>
2. the spirit of wisdom<br>
3. and understanding,<br>
4. the spirit of counsel<br>
5. and might,<br>
6. the spirit of knowledge<br>
7. and of the fear of the Lord;<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 11: 1 & 2 NLT<br>
(Out of the stump of the line of Jesse will grow a shoot -- Jesse was King David's father.)<br>
Out of the stump of David's family will grow a shoot --<br>
yes, a new Branch bearing fruit from the old root.<br>
<br>
1. And the Spirit of the Lord will rest on him --<br>
2. the Spirit of wisdom and<br>
3. understanding,<br>
4. the Spirit of counsel and<br>
5. might,<br>
6. the Spirit of knowledge<br>
7. and the fear of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There may be another list of a seven-fold spirit<br>
found in The Book of Enoch.<br>
The English translators are not in agreement on how to number<br>
the chapter numbers and verse numbers.<br>
As a result of this numbering disagreement,<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch chapter 61 verses 8 through 11<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch Chapter 60 verses 10 through 14<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch Chapter 61 verses 10 through 14.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord of spirits and Lord of the spirits, is the Lord of Hosts, and He is<br>
the Master and Lord of Heaven's Angel Armies, known in Hebrew as, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
<br>
The Chosen One, The Elect One is Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck.<br>
The elect ones are the saved believers and followers, the holy set-apart Saints.<br>
The Elect One lives and dwells inside the elect ones.<br>
The light of the world lives and dwells inside the elect ones, making the saved believers and followers the lights of the world.<br>

THE BOOK OF ENOCH:<br>
TRANSLATED FROM THE ETHIOPIC, WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES.<br>
BY REV. George H. Schodde, PH. D.<br>
PROFESSOR IN CAPITAL UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO.<br>
1882 English Translation.<br>
chapter 61 verses 8 through 11<br>
8. And the Lord of the spirits placed his Chosen One on the throne of his glory, and he will judge all the deeds of the holy ones in heaven, and will weigh their deeds on scales.<br>
9. And when he shall raise his countenance to judge their paths that are secret by the word of the name of the Lord of the spirits, and their path in the way of the just judgement of the highest God, then they will all speak with ONE voice, and bless, and praise, and exalt, and glorify the name of the Lord of the spirits.<br>
10. And then will cry out all the host of the heavens, and all the holy ones above, and the host of God, Cherubim and Seraphim and Ophanim, and all the angels of power, and all the angels of supremacies, and the Chosen One, and the other powers on the earth, above the water, on that day;<br>
11. and will raise ONE voice, and will bless, and glorify, and praise, and exalt, in the spirit of faith [fidelity], and in the spirit of wisdom and of patience, and in the spirit of mercy, and in the spirit of judgement and of peace, and in the spirit of goodness, and will all say with ONE voice;<br>
'Blessed is he, and blessed be the name of the Lord of the spirits, in eternity, and to eternity.'<br>

<br>
The Book of Enoch.<br>
Archbishop Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation<br>
Chapter 60 verses 10 through 14<br>
<br>
10. Then the Lord of spirits seated upon the throne of his glory the Elect One;<br>
11. Who shall judge all the works of the holy, in heaven above, and in a balance shall he weigh their actions. And when he shall lift up his countenance to judge their secret ways in the word of the name of the Lord of spirits, and their progress in the path of the righteous judgement of God most high;<br>
12. They shall all speak with united voice; and bless, glorify, exalt, and praise, in the name of the Lord of spirits.<br>
13. He shall call to every power of the heavens, to all the holy above, and to the power of God. The Cherubim, the Seraphim, and the Ophanin, all the angels of power, and all the angels of the Lords, namely, of the Elect One, and of the other Power, who was upon earth over the water on that day,<br>
14. Shall raise their united voice; shall bless, glorify, praise, and exalt with the spirit of faith, with the spirit of wisdom and patience, with the spirit of mercy, with the spirit of judgement and peace, and with the spirit of benevolence; all shall say with united voice:<br>
Blessed is He; and the name of the Lord of spirits shall be blessed for ever and for ever; all, who sleep not, shall bless it in heaven above.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch Chapter 61 verses 10 through 14.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Spirit of Faith<br>
2. Spirit of Wisdom<br>
3. Spirit of Longsuffering<br>
4. Spirit of Mercy<br>
5. Spirit of Judgement<br>
6. Spirit of Peace<br>
7. Spirit of Benevolence<br>
<br>
What does the word, Benevolence, mean?<br>
Referring again to the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries,<br>
in June 2023, we went to those online Dictionaries to look at, combine and merge together their word definitions<br>
for the word, Benevolence.<br>
According to those online Dictionaries, Benevolence means,<br>
kind and generous<br>
wishing good, the desire to do good; kindness; generosity.<br>
an act of kindness or generosity.<br>
the quality of being kind and helpful:<br>
the quality of being kind, helpful and generous<br>
the act of giving or helping<br>
an act of kindness<br>
inclination or tendency to help or do good to others; charity<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next passage gives us an update about what happened to Wisdom.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has three verses.<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has two verses.<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has two verses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has three verses.<br>
Wisdom did not find a place where she might live, and a dwelling-place was given to her in the heavens.<br>
2. Wisdom came to dwell amongst the children of men, and found no dwelling-place; wisdom returned to her place and took her seat amongst the angels.<br>
3. And injustice came forth from its repository; whom it did not seek, them it found, and dwelt with them, like the rain in the desert, and like dew in the thirsty land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 42, all of chapter 42, which only has two verses.<br>
1. Wisdom found not a place on earth where she could inhabit; her dwelling therefore is in heaven.<br>
2. Wisdom went forth to dwell amongst the sons of men, but she obtained not an habitation. Wisdom returned to her place, and seated herself in the midst of the angels. But iniquity went forth after her return, who unwillingly found an habitation, and resided amongst them, as rain in the desert, and as a dew in a thirsty land.<br>

<br>
Jeremiah 17: 5 & 6 (KJV)<br>
17:5	Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.<br>
17:6	For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17: 5 & 6 -- NLT<br>
5<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Cursed are those who put their trust in mere humans,<br>
who rely on human strength<br>
and turn their hearts away from the Lord.<br>
6<br>
They are like stunted shrubs in the desert,<br>
with no hope for the future.<br>
They will live in the barren wilderness,<br>
in an uninhabited salty land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:43 (KJV)<br>
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12: 43-45 (NLT)<br>
43 "When an evil (unclean) spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none.<br>
44 Then it says, 'I will return to the person I came from.' So it returns and finds its former home empty, swept, and in order.<br>
45 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before. That will be the experience of this evil generation."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11:24 (KJV)<br>
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.<br>
<br>
Luke 11: 24-26 (NLT)<br>
24 "When an evil (unclean) spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, searching for rest. But when it finds none, it says, 'I will return to the person I came from.'<br>
25 So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order.<br>
26 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next passage talks about a desert, called, Dudel.<br>
Could this desert be the location of the "dry places" where devils and demons go,<br>
when they are rebuked and cast out, and are gone out of a man?<br>
We will find out here, in just a moment. The answer is found...<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 4 through 6<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 6 through 9<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 6 through 9.<br>
<br>
But before we go there, take a look at this...<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
Enoch Chapter 8, verse 1 and 2<br>
1. And Azazel taught mankind to make swords and knives and shields and coats of mail, and taught them to see what was behind them, and their works of art: bracelets and ornaments, and the use of rouge, and the beautifying of the eye-brows, and the dearest and choicest stones and all colouring substances and the metals of the earth.<br>
2. And there was great wickedness and much fornication, and they sinned, and all their ways were corrupt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Different translations spell Azazel's name differently.<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
Enoch Chapter 8, verse 1 and 2<br>
1. Moreover Azazyel taught men to make swords, knives, shields, breastplates, the fabrication of mirrors.<br>
(the fabrication of mirrors was so that it made them see that which was behind them.)<br>
2. Impiety increased; fornication multiplied; and they transgressed and corrupted all their ways, and the workmanship of bracelets and ornaments, the use of paint, the beautifying of the eyebrows, the use of stones of every valuable and select kind, and of all sorts of dyes, so that the world became altered.<br>
<br>
<br>
This one, Azazel, that taught all of this, we will read what happened to him here, next.<br>
He gets sent to a dry place, a desert.<br>
As for this Evil Knowledge he taught,<br>
He had other associates that also taught additional things.<br>
His associates, and what they taught, are also mentioned there in Enoch Chapter 8.<br>
If you want to look at a longer list of this Evil Knowledge that was taught...<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 69<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 68<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 69.<br>
<br>
We have a quickly-made list of that Evil Knowledge<br>
and you can see the compiled list<br>
in the Bible study, titled, Evil Knowledge<br>
which is at the end of Christian Essays 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
Different translations spell his name differently.<br>
<br>
What happened to this one, Azazel, that taught this Evil Knowledge?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 4 through 6<br>
4. And again the Lord spoke to Rufael: "Bind Azazel hand and foot, and put him in the darkness; make an opening in the desert, which is in Dudael, and put him there.<br>
5. And lay upon him rough and pointed rocks, and cover him with darkness that he may remain there forever, and cover his face that he may not see the light!<br>
6. And on the great day of judgement he will be cast into the fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 10 verses 6 through 9<br>
6. Again the Lord said to Raphael, Bind Azazyel hand and foot; cast him into darkness; and opening the desert which is in Dudael, cast him in there.<br>
7. Throw upon him hurled and pointed stones, covering him with darkness;<br>
8. There shall he remain for ever; cover his face, that he may not see the light.<br>
9. And in the great day of judgement let him be cast into the fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next passage seems to describe the mansions or dwelling places<br>
that we will call home when we get to heaven.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord of spirits and Lord of the spirits, is the Lord of Hosts, and He is<br>
the Master and Lord of Heaven's Angel Armies, known in Hebrew as, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat.<br>
<br>
The Elect One is Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck.<br>
The elect ones are the saved believers and followers, the holy set-apart Saints,<br>
also known as the just ones, the holy and the elect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
4. And here I saw another vision, the dwellings of the just and the resting-places of the holy.<br>
5. Here my eyes saw their dwellings with the angels, and their resting-places with the holy, and they asked and petitioned and prayed in behalf of the children of men, and justice like water flowed before them, and mercy like dew on the earth; thus it is amongst them to all eternity.<br>
6. And in those days my eyes saw the place of the chosen of justice and of faith [fidelity], and how justice will be in their days, and the just and chosen without number before him to all eternity.<br>
7. And I saw their dwelling under the wings of the Lord of the spirits; and all the just and chosen before him are ornamented as with the light of fire, and their mouths are full of blessings, and their lips praise the name of the Lord of the spirits, and justice before him will not cease.<br>
8. Here I desired to dwell, and my soul longed for this place; here my portion has been before, for such is established concerning me before the Lord of the spirits.<br>
9. And in those days I blessed and exalted the name of the Lord of the spirits with blessings and praise, for he has strengthened me in blessing and praise according to the will of the Lord of the spirits.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 39 verses 4 through 9<br>
4. There I saw another vision; I saw the habitations and couches of the saints. There my eyes beheld their habitations with the angels, and their couches with the holy ones. They were entreating, supplicating, and praying for the sons of men; whilst righteousness like water flowed before them, and mercy like dew was scattered over the earth.<br>
And thus shall it be with them for ever and for ever.<br>
5. At that time my eyes beheld the dwelling (place)<br>
6. Countless shall be the number of the holy and the elect, (in his presence)<br>
in the presence of God of the elect, of truth, faith, and righteousness.<br>
<br>
7. Their residence I beheld under the wings of the Lord of spirits.<br>
All the holy and the elect sung before him, in appearance like a blaze of fire; their mouths being full of blessings, and their lips glorifying the name of the Lord of spirits. And righteousness incessantly dwelt before him, for ever and for ever.<br>
8. There was I desirous of remaining, and my soul longed for that habitation.<br>
There was my antecedent inheritance; for thus had I prevailed before the Lord of spirits.<br>
(There was my portion before; for thus had it been prevailed respecting me.)<br>
<br>
9. At that time I glorified and extolled the name of the Lord of spirits with blessing and with praise; for he has established it with blessing and with praise, according to his own good pleasure.<br>
(according to the will of the Lord of spirits.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And we see Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck,<br>
assigning our mansions, or dwelling places, to us in this next passage...<br>

3. On that day the chosen One will sit upon the throne of glory, and will choose amongst their deeds [men's deeds] and places without number, and their spirit will become strong in them when they see my Chosen One and those who have called upon my holy and glorious name.<br>
4. And on that day I will cause my Chosen One to dwell amongst them, and will transform heaven and make it a blessing and a light eternally.<br>
5. And I will transform the earth and make it a blessing, and will cause my chosen ones to dwell thereon; and those who have committed sins and crimes will not step on it.<br>
6. For I have seen and satisfied with peace my just ones, and have placed them before me; but for the sinners there awaits before me a judgement, that I may destroy them from the face of the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 45 verses 3 through 5<br>
3. In that day shall the Elect One sit upon a throne of glory; and shall choose their conditions and countless habitations<br>
(whilst their spirits within them shall be strengthened, when they behold my Elect One),<br>
shall choose them for those who have fled for protection to my holy and glorious name.<br>
4. In that day I will cause my Elect One to dwell in the midst of them; will change the face of heaven; will bless it, and illuminate it for ever.<br>
5. I will also change the face of the earth; will bless it; and cause those whom I have elected to dwell upon it.<br>
But those who have committed sin and iniquity shall not inhabit it,<br>
(But those who have committed sin and iniquity shall not tread upon it.)<br>
for I have marked their proceedings. (for I have seen them.)<br>
My righteous ones will I satisfy with peace, placing them before me; but the condemnation of sinners shall draw near, that I may destroy them from the face of the earth.<br>

11:1 And when the people complained,<br>
(And when the people were as it were complainers, it was evil in the eyes of the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled)<br>

<br>
Numbers 21:4-7 -- KJV<br>
21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom:<br>
and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.<br>

<br>
<br>
The Book of Enoch also has a warning about those who utter complaints...<br>
<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 10 through 13<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 11 through 13<br>
<br>
and in the Eth Cepher<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 11 through 13.<br>
<br>
<br>
To lament is to express sadness, regret, annoyance or disappointment about something you think is unsatisfactory or unfair.<br>
<br>
In the George H. Schodde 1882 translation<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 10 through 13<br>
10. And thus also is one such apartment made for the sinners when they die, and are buried in the earth, without a judgement having been passed upon them during their lives.<br>
11. Here their souls are separated in this great affliction until the great day of judgement and punishment and affliction upon the revilers to eternity, and the vengeance for their souls, and here he binds them to eternity.<br>
12. And if it was before eternity, then this apartment has been made for the souls of those who lament and those who reveal their destruction when they were killed in the days of the sinners.<br>
13. And thus it has been created for the souls of men who were not just, but sinners, who were complete in their crimes; and they will be with criminals like themselves; but their souls will not be killed on the day of judgement and will not be taken from here."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Richard Laurence 1838 English Translation,<br>
it is found in Enoch, Chapter 22 verses 11 through 13<br>
11. And in the same way likewise are sinners separated when they die, and are buried in the earth; judgement not overtaking them in their lifetime.<br>
12. Here their souls are separated. Moreover, abundant is their suffering until the time of the great judgement, the castigation, (the chastisement, the criticism, the severe punishment) and the torment of those who eternally execrate, (who eternally curse and express strong disapproval or hatred,) whose souls are punished and bound there for ever.<br>
13. And thus has it been front the beginning of the world. (And thus has it been from the beginning of the world.) Thus has there existed a separation between the souls of those who utter complaints, and of those who watch for their destruction, to slaughter them in the day of sinners.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: As we now finish this look at these selected passages from the Book of Enoch, here is one final thought to ponder.<br>
In that last verse, we see...<br>
the souls of those who utter complaints,<br>
and of those who watch for their destruction.<br>
Those who watch for their destruction?<br>
Think about that. We are told to to be sober and watch.<br>
Being a sober watchman is one thing, but maybe, this verse may suggest that being extra worried and fearful of coming destruction can develop into a form of sin.<br>
The Bible does promise that, the fearful shall go into the lake which burneth with fire.<br>
Let us be a vigilant, sober watchmen, without becoming fearful of coming destruction, and may we not have a certain fearful looking for of judgement.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:6 (KJV)<br>
Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 4:7 (KJV)<br>
But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5:8 (KJV)<br>
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:8 (KJV)<br>
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<br>
<br>
Revelation 21:8 -- NLT<br>
"But cowards, unbelievers, the corrupt, murderers, the immoral, those who practice witchcraft, idol worshipers, and all liars -- their fate is in the fiery lake of burning sulphur. This is the second death."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10: 26-29 (KJV)<br>
10:26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,<br>
10:27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgement and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.<br>
10:28 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:<br>
10:29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10: 26-29 -- NLT<br>
26 Dear friends, if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice that will cover these sins.<br>
27 There is only the terrible expectation of God's judgement and the raging fire that will consume his enemies.<br>
28 For anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.<br>
29 Just think how much worse the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God, and have treated the blood of the covenant, which made us holy, as if it were common and unholy, and have insulted and disdained the Holy Spirit who brings God's mercy to us.<br>
