<br>
Mourning<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: <br>
<br>
In January 2019, I was mourning the loss of my two old dogs.  Because of this, I wanted to look at the Bible verses that talk about mourning.  We will look at those Bible verses here in just a moment.<br>
<br>
It was just before 10am on the morning of Wednesday, the 30th day of January 2019, when a veterinarian completed the medical procedure that carefully and gently brought the lives of my two old dogs to an end.<br>
<br>
The larger dog was Bammy. Bammy looked like a black Labrador Retriever and yet was also half pit bull. She mainly just looked like a black lab, mostly all black with some white down the middle of the front neck, chest and belly, with a touch of white on the end of her paws. She was very calm, peaceful and loving, gentle and careful. You could not even tell that she was half pit, but you might vaguely wonder about it if you carefully studied the shape of her head.<br>
<br>
The smaller dog was named, Chopper.  Chopper was a tan-brown deer Chihuahua, but he did not behave like one at all. He was never nervous, never growly, never nippy, and never shaky. He only would bark when you would expect a faithful watchdog to bark, and not unnecessarily, unless you wanted him to.  He was very calm and easy-going, and would let you carry him around, or even push him about in a pram (a baby buggy). He would just go along with whatever you were doing, and was happy just to be with you and lay by your side or on your lap.<br>
<br>
The larger dog, Bammy, was born sometime in February of 2009, and joined our family when she was 9 months old, in November of 2009.  She wagged her tail all the time, even whilst eating her food, which I saw as her way of being so thankful, and she loved running with the kids on the playground equipment and going down the slide.  She also was always on the job, protecting us, being like it says there in Hebrews 4:12, she had a gift of being able to be a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. After many years of her gentle companionship and protection as our watchdog, she was getting to be in a great deal of pain, with arthritis, skin diseases and infections. When her life ended, she was 9 years old, and she would have turned 10 years old if she would have lived for just a few more weeks.<br>
<br>
The smaller dog, Chopper, was born sometime in April of 2005, and was rescued from an animal shelter. He was adopted into our family on Saturday 14 July 2007, when he was 2 years old. He loved chasing the ball and would even take turns going up to each child at the playground, laying the ball down at their feet, offering each kid an opportunity to throw it for him, and at the end of the day, he would snuggle up and rest his little head on the shoulder of the one who was holding him.  We even taught him how to, kind of, talk.  I could have sworn I heard him say a few times, words, like, ma ma, and, I, love, you. After many years of his energetic playfulness and love, old age was taking its toll on him.  He was losing his eyesight, he was losing his hearing, he had a tender spot on his back, and he was having moments of incontinence. When the time came for him to pass away, he was 13 years old. If he would have lived for just a few more months, he would have turned 14 in April of 2019.<br>
<br>
Both of the dogs had lumps and bumps on or under their skin, which were probably tumours of some kind.<br>
<br>
Just over a week after that day when we said good-bye to our two old dogs, I typed-up these words here, so that I would not forget the things about them that made me love them both so much.  I have a short list here of some of their characteristics.<br>
<br>
Love. They demonstrated true, unconditional Love, affection, benevolence and charity. We were well-loved by them, and they loved us, no matter what. They reminded me of Proverbs 17:17 (KJV) where it says, A friend loveth at all times....<br>
<br>
Trust. They had put their complete and total trust in us at all times, and in all situations.  The larger dog sometimes had nails to be trimmed, and the smaller dog had a little bad tooth to be pulled out, which had to be done on two occasions over the years. They totally trusted us during those times, and they even trusted us all the way to the very final hour and minute of their lives -- they completely trusted us.<br>
<br>
Loyalty and faithfulness.  They were very loyal and faithful. <br>
<br>
Obedience. They were very obedient. The Dog Whisperer, Cesar Millan would have been very proud of them, and the family that they belonged to.<br>
<br>
Friendship.  They were our friends. They were like a friend that always loved you at all times, and in all seasons, in all places, circumstances and situations.<br>
<br>
They comforted us, they gave us comfort, they gave us peace, and they protected us, every day and throughout every night.<br>
<br>
I want to be like that for God, I want to be like that for the people in my life, and I want to also be remembered that way after I'm gone.<br>
<br>
There will be times and seasons that include moments when one may have mourning, sadness and weeping.  We're going to take a look at some Bible verses here that talk about mourning.<br>
<br>

However, this next part here in the Oxford Dictionary is what I think the Bible verse was trying to describe, which was more likely,<br>

(of the neck or features) distorted or turned to one side.<br>
contorted.<br>

19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.<br>
20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.<br>

17 The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where this was written:<br>
18<br>
"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br>
for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor.<br>
He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released,<br>
that the blind will see,<br>
that the oppressed will be set free,<br>
19 and that the time of the Lord's favour has come (and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord)."<br>
20 He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue looked at him intently. <br>

that the time of the Lord's favour has come (to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord).<br>

Commentary:<br>
The summary and conclusion is, if you are going through mourning and weeping, the Lord will comfort you, and will eventually lead you from your mourning and weeping, into a time of joy and dancing, whilst comforting you and being close to you along the way.<br>
If there are other people in your life that are going through a season of mourning and weeping, we are to be their friend and go through it with them, weeping with them if that is what we need to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When it was time to say my final good-bye to my two old dogs, I pet them and held them one last time, I looked into their eyes, and I told them that I loved them, and as I spent that final moment with each one of them, I prayed that the Lord would give them mercy and grace, and then I prayed this prayer for each one of them...<br>

Psalms 139:1-3 KJV<br>
1 O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.<br>
2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.<br>
3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.<br>
(Thou winnowest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.)
<br>
The Hebrew word used there in verse 3 for, compassest, is pronounced, zaw-raw.<br>
The definitions for zaw-raw, according to the Strong's Hebrew Lexicon, and the Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions, are...<br>
to toss about, to diffuse, winnow<br>
cast away, compass, disperse, fan, scatter (away), spread, strew, winnow, sift.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, this second reference book, titled, A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,<br>
is more commonly known as the Brown–Driver–Briggs or BDB, which is based on the name of its three authors.<br>
The BDB is a standard reference for Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, first published in the year 1906.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English says that, winnow, means,<br>
to make a list, group, or quantity smaller by getting rid of the things that you do not need or want<br>
<br>
The Definition of "winnow" from the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary:<br>
to blow the chaff (the outer coverings) from grain before it can be used as food.<br>
to reduce a large number of people or things to a much smaller number by judging their quality.<br>
<br>
<br>
The HarperCollins Cobuild Advanced English Dictionary says,<br>
If you winnow a group of things or people, you reduce its size by separating the ones that are useful or relevant from the ones that are not.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
So, if the Lord winnows the path that you are walking on, we could say that the Lord goes before you, and checks the path you are on before you get there, the path in front of you, and clears out the people and things that are down the path before you get there.<br>
I imagine the Lord getting people and things off of my path before I get there;<br>
people and things that could stop or block me, or hinder me, distract me, slow me down, people and things that might make me trip or cause me to walk off of the path that the Lord wants me to walk on;<br>
people and things that might interfere with me going in the direction that the Lord wants me to travel.<br>
He may also keep people and things on my path, on purpose.<br>
The Lord may put things and people into your path, people and things that are on your path to help you;<br>
people, things and situations that are intended for you, and are placed or kept there on or along your path, because those people and things are a part of God's plan and purpose for you and your life.<br>

Matthew 10:29-31 KJV<br>
29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.<br>
30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.<br>
31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.<br>
<br>
Matthew 10:29-34 NLT<br>
29 What is the price of two sparrows -- one copper coin? <br>
(What is the price of two sparrows -- one assarion -- the smallest copper Roman coin -- one assarion would be equal to having 116 of a denarius, which is very cheap, a very small amount of money, common, not worth much -- the NIV interprets this amount of money as a penny -- the NASB says, Are not two sparrows sold for a cent?)<br>
But not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it. <br>
<br>
30 And the very hairs on your head are all numbered. <br>
31 So don't be afraid; you are more valuable to God than a whole flock of sparrows.<br>

Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex!<br>
Your workmanship is marvellous -- how well I know it.<br>

You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion,<br>
as I was woven together in the dark of the womb.<br>

15 (My strength, my body) My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.<br>

John 8:40-45 KJV<br>
(Jesus is talking to the Pharisees here, when he said to them...)<br>
40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.<br>
41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.<br>
42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.<br>
43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.<br>
44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.<br>
45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.<br>
<br>
John 8:40-47 NLT (Jesus is talking to the Pharisees here, when he said to them...)<br>
...you are trying to kill me because I told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing. <br>
41<br>
No, you are imitating your real father."<br>
They replied, "We aren't illegitimate children! God himself is our true Father."<br>
42<br>
Jesus told them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, because I have come to you from God. I am not here on my own, but he sent me. <br>
43 Why can't you understand what I am saying? It's because you can't even hear me! <br>
44 For you are the children of your father the devil, and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a murderer from the beginning. He has always hated the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, it is consistent with his character; for he is a liar and the father of lies. <br>
45 So when I tell the truth, you just naturally don't believe me! <br>
46 Which of you can truthfully accuse me of sin? And since I am telling you the truth, why don't you believe me? <br>
47 Anyone who belongs to God listens gladly to the words of God. But you don't listen because you don't belong to God."<br>

1 John 3:1-3 NLT<br>
1 See how very much our Father loves us, for he calls us his children, and that is what we are! But the people who belong to this world don't recognise that we are God's children because they don't know him. <br>
2 Dear friends, we are already God's children, but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears. But we do know that we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is. <br>

8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<br>
9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?<br>
10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?<br>
11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?<br>
<br>
Matthew 7:7-11 NLT<br>
7 "Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you. <br>
8 For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.<br>
9 "You parents -- if your children ask for a loaf of bread, do you give them a stone instead? <br>
10 Or if they ask for a fish, do you give them a snake? Of course not! <br>

Leviticus 19:18 NLT<br>
18"Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against a fellow Israelite, but love your neighbour as yourself. I am the Lord.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
This verse tells us to love our neighbour, but it does not say that we need to hate our enemies.<br>
Somehow, over time, by the time we get to the new testament, it somehow got twisted and distorted into<br>
something like this...<br>
Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.<br>
Jesus teaches us, that this is not accurate, but this is what people were commonly saying by the time Jesus comes on the scene.<br>
This is why it is important to go directly to the scriptures, to the Torah, to the Bible.<br>
Do not assume that someone is accurately representing the Bible if they are not quoting it directly out of the Bible.<br>
People were thinking that this saying was some kind of law when, as Jesus points out here, it's not entirely accurate.<br>
It is a half-truth, 50% true, and 50% not true, the same kind of mixture of good and evil knowledge that Satan was trying to feed Adam and Eve.<br>
What if we have some sayings and rules that we are following in our mind that are really not exactly true or right?<br>
The only way to find these and get them fixed or removed is to read the entire Bible, and compare it with what we have in our heart and mind.<br>
Here, Jesus tells us that, this saying, Love your neighbour and hate your enemy, is not quite right.<br>
Here is how we should do it, according to the teaching of Jesus...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 5: 43-48 <br>
43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.<br>
44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;<br>
45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.<br>
46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?<br>
47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?<br>
48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.<br>
<br>
Matthew 5: 43-48 NLT<br>
43"You have heard (part of Leviticus 19:18) the law that says, 'Love your neighbour' and hate your enemy. <br>
44 But I say, love your enemies! Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you. Pray for those who persecute you! <br>
45 In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike. <br>
46 If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. <br>
47 (If you are kind only to your brothers,) If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that. <br>
48 But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.<br>

Commentary: If pre-trib happened and you did not get raptured, or if you are going through the tribulation, or if mid-trib or post-trib is what ended up happening,<br>
here is some advice on how to get through that tribulation period.<br>

Deuteronomy 4:29-31<br>
29 But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.<br>

31 For the Lord your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon you or destroy you ....<br>

Ephesians 3:19-21 KJV (mainly focusing on verse 20)<br>
19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.<br>
20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,<br>

2 Corinthians 1:3-4 KJV<br>
3 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;<br>
4 So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1:3-9 NLT<br>
3 Dear brothers and sisters, we can't help but thank God for you, because your faith is flourishing and your love for one another is growing. <br>
4 We proudly tell God's other churches about your endurance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and hardships you are suffering. <br>
5 And God will use this persecution to show his justice and to make you worthy of his Kingdom, for which you are suffering. <br>
6 In his justice he will pay back those who persecute you.<br>
7 And God will provide rest for you who are being persecuted and also for us when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven. He will come with his mighty angels, <br>
8 in flaming fire, bringing judgement on those who don't know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus. <br>
9 They will be punished with eternal destruction, forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power. <br>

Psalms 34: 17-19 KJV<br>
17 The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.<br>

(The Lord is nigh to the broken of heart; and saveth such as be contrite of spirit.)<br>
19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.<br>
<br>
Psalms 34: 17-19 NLT<br>
17<br>
The Lord hears his people when they call to him for help.<br>
He rescues them from all their troubles.<br>

The Lord is close to the broken-hearted;<br>
he rescues those whose spirits are crushed.<br>

The righteous person faces many troubles,<br>
but the Lord comes to the rescue each time.<br>

Revelation 21:3-4 KJV<br>

John 17: 22-26 (to the end of chapter 17) KJV<br>
22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:<br>
23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.<br>
24 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.<br>
25 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.<br>
26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.<br>
<br>
John 17: 22-26 (to the end of chapter 17) NLT<br>
22 "I have given them the glory you gave me, so they may be one as we are one. <br>
23 I am in them and you are in me. May they experience such perfect unity that the world will know that you sent me and that you love them as much as you love me. <br>
24 Father, I want these whom you have given me to be with me where I am. Then they can see all the glory you gave me because you loved me even before the world began!<br>
25 "O righteous Father, the world doesn't know you, but I do; and these disciples know you sent me. <br>
26 I have revealed you to them, and I will continue to do so. Then your love for me will be in them, and I will be in them."<br>

Hebrews 1: 2 & 3 KJV<br>
2 In these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;<br>
3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;<br>
<br>
Hebrews 1: 2 & 3 NLT:<br>
2 In these final days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God promised everything to the Son as an inheritance, and through the Son he created the universe. <br>
3 The Son radiates God's own glory and expresses the very character of God, and he sustains everything by the mighty power of his command. When he had cleansed us from our sins, he sat down in the place of honour at the right hand of the majestic God in heaven. <br>

Romans 8: 30-34 KJV<br>
30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.<br>
31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?<br>
32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?<br>
33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.<br>
34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 30-34 NLT<br>
30 And having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And having called them, he gave them right standing with himself. And having given them right standing, he gave them his glory.<br>
31 What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us? <br>
32 Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won't he also give us everything else? <br>
33 Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? No one -- for God himself has given us right standing with himself. <br>
34 Who then will condemn us? No one -- for Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of honour at God's right hand, pleading for us.<br>

2 Corinthians 5:17, 18 and 19 KJV<br>
17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<br>
18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;<br>
19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 5: 16-19 NLT<br>
16 So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now! <br>
17 This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!<br>
18 And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him. <br>
19 For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people's sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation.<br>

1 John 4: 9-11 KJV<br>
9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<br>
10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<br>
11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.<br>
<br>
1 John 4: 9-11 NLT<br>
9 God showed how much he loved us by sending his one and only Son into the world so that we might have eternal life through him. <br>
10 This is real love -- not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins.<br>
11 Dear friends, since God loved us that much, we surely ought to love each other.<br>

Commentary:<br>
When studying the Bible, don't start where chapters start, and don't stop where chapters end, because the Bible was was not originally divided into the chapters that we see today.<br>
Remember that the chapter numbers did not originally exist, so the scriptures would have continually flowed from one chapter into the next.<br>
With that in mind, listen to how the scriptures read when we start near the end of Romans chapter 8, and go right into chapter 9.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8: starting in verse 37, and then continuing into chapter 9, verse 1.<br>
KJV:<br>
37 In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.<br>
38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,<br>
39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
1 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,<br>
<br>
Romans 8: verses 37, 38 and 39 (which is the end of chapter 8), and then continuing into chapter 9, verse 1.<br>
NLT:<br>
37 Despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.<br>
38 And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God's love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, (nor rulers,) neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow -- not even the powers of hell can separate us from God's love. <br>
39 No power in the sky above or in the earth below -- indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
1 With Christ as my witness, I speak with utter truthfulness. My conscience and the Holy Spirit confirm it. <br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 15: 3-7 KJV<br>
3 He spake this parable unto them, saying,<br>
4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?<br>
5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.<br>
6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.<br>
7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth....<br>
<br>
Luke 15: 3-7 NLT<br>
3 Jesus told them this story: <br>
4 "If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, what will he do? Won't he leave the ninety-nine others in the wilderness and go to search for the one that is lost until he finds it? <br>
5 And when he has found it, he will joyfully carry it home on his shoulders. <br>
6 When he arrives, he will call together his friends and neighbours, saying, 'Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.' <br>
7 In the same way, there is more joy in heaven over one lost sinner who repents and returns to God....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 3:14-21 KJV<br>
14 I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,<br>
16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;<br>
17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,<br>
18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;<br>
19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.<br>
20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,<br>
21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 3:14-21 NLT<br>
14 When I think of all this, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <br>
15 the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth. (the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name.) <br>
16 I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit. <br>
17 Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God's love and keep you strong. <br>
18 And may you have the power to understand, as all God's people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is. <br>
19 May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God.<br>
20 Now all glory to God, who is able, through his mighty power at work within us, to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think. <br>
21 Glory to him in the church and in Christ Jesus through all generations forever and ever! Amen.<br>

John 1:12-13 KJV<br>
12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:<br>
13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<br>
<br>
John 1:12-13 NLT<br>
12 But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God. <br>
13 They are reborn -- not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Father's Love Letter concluded with one last paraphrased statement, where the Lord says in the love letter that He is waiting for you.<br>
The study points to the prodigal son story as the source of where they created this paraphrased statement, but there is no verse in the story that clearly indicates that this is true.<br>
<br>
One might suppose that the father may have been waiting for the prodigal son, yet the Bible does not clearly say that he really was actually waiting.<br>
<br>
I do not agree that one can say that God is waiting for us by pointing to the prodigal son story.<br>
<br>
That is why going directly to the Bible and reading the words directly out of the Bible is always better than having someone else paraphrase it or summarise the Bible instead.<br>
This is why the actual Father's Love Letter is not being read to you here, because it is not as precise as quoting the verses directly out of the Bible.<br>
<br>
A better place to find and produce the "God is waiting for you" paraphrased statement could be by going to the second letter of Peter, chapter 3.<br>
The Lord is waiting for us to repent and get saved, which is why he delays the rapture, the end times and the tribulation events.<br>
As soon as everyone who is supposed to get saved actually make that decision to get saved, then the rapture, wrath and tribulation events go into full forward motion.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3: 9-15 KJV<br>
9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.<br>
10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.<br>
11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,<br>
12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?<br>
13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.<br>
14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.<br>
15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation....<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3: 9-15 NLT<br>
9 The Lord isn't really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent. <br>
10 But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and the very elements themselves will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgement.<br>
(the earth and everything on it will be burned up.)<br>
(the earth and everything on it will be found destroyed.)<br>
<br>
11 Since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this, what holy and godly lives you should live, <br>
12 looking forward to the day of God and hurrying it along. On that day, he will set the heavens on fire, and the elements will melt away in the flames. <br>
13 But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world filled with God's righteousness.<br>
14 And so, dear friends, whilst you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.<br>
15 And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved. <br>
<br>
<br>

This is the end of our study of the Bible Verses that were used to help create The Father's Love Letter Bible Study.<br>
Since the end of that love letter was supposed to be based on the Parable of the lost, Prodigal Son,<br>
we will be looking at that Prodigal Son Parable here soon.<br>

The Hired and The Prodigal<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of Jasher tells us a few stories about the evil cities of Sodom.<br>
In these stories, we see how they had invented laws that seem to be absolutely crazy and insane.<br>
For example, it was against the law to give food to the poor and the homeless.<br>
They had this law so that the homeless person might die of starvation, and then, the people could take all of the dead person's belongings.<br>
There were other insane and evil laws like that in Sodom. Here is the example of the Don't-Feed-The-Homeless law, in the Book of Jasher.<br>
This is found in Jasher 19.<br>
A young lady was put to death because she gave food to the poor,<br>
and the Lord was provoked at the sound of her cries as she was killed...<br>
<br>
Jasher 19: 37-46 -- J.H. Parry and Company 1887 English Translation<br>
37 For a traveller came into the city of Admah to abide there all night, with the intention of going home in the morning, and he sat opposite the door of the house of the young woman's father, to remain there, as the sun had set when be had reached that place; and the young woman saw him sitting by the door of the house.<br>
38 And he asked her for a drink of water and she said to him, Who art thou? and he said to her, I was this day going on the road, and reached here when the sun set, so I will abide here all night, and in the morning I will arise early and continue my journey.<br>
39 And the young woman went into the house and fetched the man bread and water to eat and drink.<br>
40 And this affair became known to the people of Admah, and they assembled and brought the young woman before the judges, that they should judge her for this act.<br>
41 And the judge said, The judgement of death must pass upon this woman because she transgressed our law, and this therefore is the decision concerning her.<br>
42 And the people of those cities assembled and brought out the young woman, and anointed her with honey from head to foot, as the judge had decreed, and they placed her before a swarm of bees which were then in their hives, and the bees flew upon her and stung her that her whole body was swelled.<br>
43 And the young woman cried out on account of the bees, but no one took notice of her or pitied her, and her cries ascended to heaven.<br>
44 And the Lord was provoked at this and at all the works of the cities of Sodom, for they had abundance of food, and had tranquillity amongst them, and still would not sustain the poor and the needy, and in those days their evil doings and sins became great before the Lord.<br>
45 And the Lord sent for two of the angels that had come to Abraham's house, to destroy Sodom and its cities.<br>
46 And the angels rose up from the door of Abraham's tent, after they had eaten and drunk, and they reached Sodom in the evening, and Lot was then sitting in the gate of Sodom, and when he saw them he rose to meet them, and he bowed down to the ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's think for a moment about a Bible verse that we will read again here shortly.<br>
<br>
Matthew 19:23 -- KJV<br>
19:23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br>
<br>
Matthew 19:23 -- NLT<br>
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.<br>
<br>
Remembering again our story about Sodom, that we were looking at just a moment ago, and the angels that went to Sodom, to meet and rescue Lot...<br>
<br>
Jasher 19: 43-46 -- J.H. Parry and Company 1887 English Translation<br>
...but no one took notice of her or pitied her, and her cries ascended to heaven.<br>
44 And the Lord was provoked at this and at all the works of the cities of Sodom, for they had abundance of food, and had tranquillity amongst them, and still would not sustain the poor and the needy, and in those days their evil doings and sins became great before the Lord.<br>
45 And the Lord sent for two of the angels that had come to Abraham's house, to destroy Sodom and its cities.<br>
46 And the angels rose up from the door of Abraham's tent, after they had eaten and drunk, and they reached Sodom in the evening, and Lot was then sitting in the gate of Sodom, and when he saw them he rose to meet them, and he bowed down to the ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Why was Sodom destroyed?<br>
Men wanting to have sex with angels, for starters. Those visitors were not just men, they were angels or messengers.<br>
The Bible clearly identifies, here, this activity as "a wicked thing."<br>
<br>
Genesis 19: 5-7 -- KJV<br>
19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.<br>
19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,<br>
19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 19: 5-7 -- NLT<br>
5 They shouted to Lot, "Where are the men who came to spend the night with you? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them!"<br>
6 So Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him.<br>
7 "Please, my brothers," he begged, "don't do such a wicked thing.<br>
<br>
Commentary: However, there are some additional reasons why the city of Sodom was destroyed.<br>
The people of Sodom were rich, and had plenty of bread, but did not help the poor.<br>
Being rich and having everything you need can make you become lukewarm.<br>
Are we also like this right now, as a people, as a church, as a community, as a nation, in a parade?<br>
<br>
<br>
Jasher 19:44 -- J.H. Parry and Company 1887 English Translation<br>
And the Lord was provoked at this and at all the works of the cities of Sodom, for they had abundance of food, and had tranquillity amongst them, and still would not sustain the poor and the needy, and in those days their evil doings and sins became great before the Lord.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 16: 49 & 50 -- KJV<br>
16:49 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.<br>
16:50 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 16: 49 & 50 -- NLT<br>
49 Sodom's sins were pride, gluttony, and laziness, whilst the poor and needy suffered outside her door.<br>
50 She was proud and committed detestable sins, so I wiped her out, as you have seen.<br>
(so I wiped her out, as I have seen.)<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 16: 49 & 50 -- TS2009<br>
49 "See, this was the crookedness of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, sufficiency of bread, and unconcerned ease. And she did not help the poor and needy.<br>
50 "And they were haughty and did abomination before Me, and I took them away when I saw it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 3: 15-17 -- KJV<br>
3:15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.<br>
3:16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.<br>
3:17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 3: 15-17 -- NLT<br>
15 "I know all the things you do, that you are neither hot nor cold. I wish that you were one or the other!<br>
16 But since you are like lukewarm water, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth!<br>
17 You say, 'I am rich. I have everything I want. I don't need a thing!' And you don't realise that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.<br>

<br>
Part of Ezekiel 11:5 -- KJV<br>
...Thus saith the LORD...I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's now read our first story about The Hired...<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew Chapter 19, starting at verse 28, and we keep on reading into chapter 20, going all the way to verse 16.<br>
KJV:<br>
28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br>
29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.<br>
30 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.<br>
1 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.<br>
2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.<br>
3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,<br>
4 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.<br>
5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.<br>
6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?<br>
7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.<br>
8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.<br>
9 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.<br>
10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.<br>
11 And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,<br>
12 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.<br>
13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?<br>
14 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.<br>
15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?<br>
16 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.<br>
<br>
<br>
The NLT of Matthew Chapter 19, starting a little bit earlier, at verse 21, and we keep on reading again into chapter 20, stopping at verse 16.<br>
NLT:<br>
21 Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."<br>
22 When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.<br>
23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. <br>
24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."<br>
25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?"<br>
26 Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."<br>
27 Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?"<br>
28 Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <br>
29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. <br>
30 But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.<br>
1 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. <br>
2 He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard. (A denarius was the usual daily wage of a day labourer.)<br>
3 "About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. <br>
4 He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.' <br>
5 So they went.<br>
"He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing. <br>
6 About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'<br>
7 " 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered.<br>
"He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'<br>
8 "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'<br>
9 "The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. <br>
10 So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. <br>
11 When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. <br>
12 'These who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'<br>
13 "But he answered one of them, 'I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? <br>
14 Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. <br>
15 Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?'<br>
16 "So the last will be first, and the first will be last."<br>

<br>
Luke 15:10-32 -- KJV:<br>
10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.<br>
11 And he said, A certain man had two sons:<br>
12 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.<br>
13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.<br>
14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.<br>
15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.<br>
16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.<br>
17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!<br>
18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,<br>
19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.<br>
20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.<br>
21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.<br>
22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:<br>
23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:<br>
24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.<br>
25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.<br>
26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.<br>
27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.<br>
28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him.<br>
29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:<br>
30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.<br>
31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.<br>
32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 15:10-32 -- NLT:<br>
10 In the same way, there is joy in the presence of God's angels when even one sinner repents."<br>
11 To illustrate the point further, Jesus told them this story: "A man had two sons. <br>
12 The younger son told his father, 'I want my share of your estate now before you die.' So his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons.<br>
13 "A few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land, and there he wasted all his money in wild living. <br>
14 About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve. <br>
15 He persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs. <br>
16 The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him. But no one gave him anything.<br>
17 "When he finally came to his senses, he said to himself, 'At home even the hired servants have food enough to spare, and here I am dying of hunger! <br>
18 I will go home to my father and say, "Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, <br>
19 and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant."'<br>
20 "So he returned home to his father. And whilst he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him. <br>
21 His son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant.'<br>
22 "But his father said to the servants, 'Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet. <br>
23 And kill the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast, <br>
24 for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now he is found.' So the party began.<br>
25 "Meanwhile, the older son was in the fields working. When he returned home, he heard music and dancing in the house, <br>
26 and he asked one of the servants what was going on.<br>
27 'Your brother is back,' he was told, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf. We are celebrating because of his safe return.'<br>
28 "The older brother was angry and wouldn't go in. His father came out and begged him, <br>
29 but he replied, 'All these years I've slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to. And in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends. <br>
30 Yet when this son of yours comes back after squandering your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the fattened calf!'<br>
31 "His father said to him, 'Look, dear son, you have always stayed by me, and everything I have is yours. <br>
32 We had to celebrate this happy day. For your brother was dead and has come back to life! He was lost, but now he is found!'"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  What do these two stories have in common?<br>
In both of these stories, there is someone angry near the end of the story.<br>
The one who got saved early in life was getting angry at the foolish one who repented and got saved later on, towards the end of their life.<br>
In order for the mature Christian to be angry at the new believer, the older Christian has to judge and remember the sins of the new believer, the sins that one did before he or she got saved.<br>
When we get saved, God remembers our sins no more, we are a new creature and a new creation.<br>
The old person that we used to be no longer exists.<br>
We are born again, and the sins are forgiven and forgotten.<br>
Remembering the sins of the past, before someone got saved, leads to judging and unforgiveness, and the anger that is seen in both of these stories.<br>
In both of these stories, we see the person who got saved early in life, and the foolish person who eventually repents and gets saved later in life.<br>
Both of these two types of people will both get the same eternal result, which is forgiveness, living forever in heaven, being saved, having eternal life, not ever having to die, and having all of their sins permanently erased, deleted and forgotten.<br>
<br>
The Bible commands us to not be angry and to not judge others. We do not have any permission to be angry and judge other people's sins of the past because we got saved earlier in life, and may have been reading the Bible longer than other, newer believers. Forgive each other, and look for ways to love one another and help one another. How do you send your treasures and riches up to heaven, where they will always stay safe and never lose their value?<br>
<br>
Matthew 19:21 (NLT)<br>
Jesus told him, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."<br>

Gathering Up and Falling Away<br>

<br>
Jeremiah 10: 16-25 -- KJV<br>
16 The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The Lord of hosts is his name.<br>
17 Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress (O inhabitress of the fortress).<br>
18 For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.<br>
19 Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.<br>
20 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.<br>
21 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the Lord: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.<br>
22 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.<br>
23 O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.<br>
24 O Lord, correct me, but with judgement; not in thine anger, lest thou diminish me and bring me to nothing.<br>
25 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10: 15-25 -- NLT<br>
15<br>
Idols are worthless; they are ridiculous lies!<br>
On the day of reckoning they will all be destroyed.<br>
16<br>
But the God of Israel is no idol!<br>
But the Portion of Jacob is no idol!<br>
He is the Creator of everything that exists,<br>
including Israel, his own special possession.<br>
The Lord of Heaven's Armies is his name!<br>
17<br>
Pack your bags and prepare to leave;<br>
the siege is about to begin.<br>
18<br>
For this is what the Lord says:<br>
"Suddenly, I will fling out<br>
all you who live in this land.<br>
I will pour great troubles upon you,<br>
and at last you will feel my anger."<br>
19<br>
My wound is severe,<br>
and my grief is great.<br>
My sickness is incurable,<br>
but I must bear it.<br>
20<br>
My home is gone,<br>
and no one is left to help me rebuild it.<br>
My children have been taken away,<br>
and I will never see them again.<br>
21<br>
The shepherds of my people have lost their senses.<br>
They no longer seek wisdom from the Lord.<br>
Therefore, they fail completely,<br>
and their flocks are scattered.<br>
22<br>
Listen! Hear the terrifying roar of great armies<br>
as they roll down from the north.<br>
The towns of Judah will be destroyed<br>
and become a haunt for jackals.<br>
23<br>
I know, Lord, that our lives are not our own.<br>
We are not able to plan our own course.<br>
24<br>
So correct me, Lord, but please be gentle.<br>
Do not correct me in anger, for I would die.<br>
25<br>
Pour out your wrath on the nations that refuse to acknowledge you -- <br>
on the peoples that do not call upon your name.<br>
For they have devoured your people Israel.<br>
(For they have devoured Jacob.)<br>
they have devoured and consumed them,<br>
making the land a desolate wilderness.<br>

2 Thessalonians 2: 1-12 -- KJV<br>
1 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,<br>
2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.<br>
3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;<br>
4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.<br>
5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?<br>
6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.<br>
7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.<br>
8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:<br>
9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,<br>
10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.<br>
11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:<br>
12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 2: 1-12 -- NLT<br>
1 Now, dear brothers and sisters, let us clarify some things about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and how we will be gathered to meet him. <br>
2 Don't be so easily shaken or alarmed by those who say that the day of the Lord has already begun. Don't believe them, even if they claim to have had a spiritual vision, a revelation, or a letter supposedly from us. <br>
3 Don't be fooled by what they say. For that day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of lawlessness is revealed -- the one who brings destruction.<br>
(For that day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of sin is revealed -- the son of destruction.)<br>
<br>
4 He will exalt himself and defy everything that people call god and every object of worship. He will even sit in the temple of God, claiming that he himself is God.<br>
5 Don't you remember that I told you about all this when I was with you? <br>
6 And you know what is holding him back, for he can be revealed only when his time comes. <br>
7 For this lawlessness is already at work secretly, and it will remain secret until the one who is holding it back steps out of the way. <br>
8 Then the man of lawlessness will be revealed, but the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth and destroy him by the splendour of his coming.<br>
9 This man will come to do the work of Satan with counterfeit power and signs and miracles. <br>
10 He will use every kind of evil deception to fool those on their way to destruction, because they refuse to love and accept the truth that would save them. <br>
11 So God will cause them to be greatly deceived, and they will believe these lies. <br>
12 Then they will be condemned for enjoying evil rather than believing the truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 2:3 KJV<br>
3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;<br>
<br>
Strong's definition for<br>
"a falling away" would be...<br>
defection, apostasy, revolt.<br>
defection from truth<br>
repudiation, divorce<br>
<br>
Here are the definitions coming from the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries, for the word,<br>
apostasy:<br>
when someone suddenly stops believing in a religion or supporting a political party<br>
the relinquishment or rejection of one's religion or principles or of one's affiliation to a specified political party<br>
the act of giving up your religious or political beliefs and leaving a religion or a political party<br>
<br>
repudiation is the act of refusing to accept something or someone as true, good, or reasonable:<br>
If you repudiate something or someone, you show that you strongly disagree with them and do not want to be connected with them in any way.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 10: 3-5 KJV<br>
3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:<br>
4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)<br>
5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 10: 3-5 NLT:<br>
3 We are human, but we don't wage war as humans do. <br>
4 We use God's mighty weapons, not worldly weapons, to knock down the strongholds of human reasoning and to destroy false arguments. <br>
5 We destroy every proud obstacle that keeps people from knowing God. We capture their rebellious thoughts and teach them to obey Christ.<br>

Psalms 68: 1-7 KJV<br>
1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.<br>
(let them also that hate him flee from his face.)<br>
2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.<br>
3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, (let them rejoice with gladness,) let them exceedingly rejoice.<br>
4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah, and rejoice before him.<br>
5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.<br>

Psalms 68: 1-7 NLT<br>
For the choir director: A song. A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
Rise up, O God, and scatter your enemies.<br>
Let those who hate God run for their lives.<br>
2<br>
Blow them away like smoke.<br>
Melt them like wax in a fire.<br>
Let the wicked perish in the presence of God.<br>
3<br>
But let the godly rejoice.<br>
Let them be glad in God's presence.<br>
Let them be filled with joy.<br>
4<br>
Sing praises to God and to his name!<br>
Sing loud praises to him who rides the clouds.<br>
(Sing loud praises to him who rides through the deserts.)<br>
His name is the Lord -- <br>
rejoice in his presence!<br>
5<br>
Father to the fatherless, defender of widows -- <br>
this is God, whose dwelling is holy.<br>

he sets the prisoners free and gives them joy.<br>

Isaiah 45: 3-12 KJV<br>
<br>
3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the Lord, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.<br>
4 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.<br>
5 I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:<br>
6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the Lord, and there is none else.<br>
7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.<br>
8 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the Lord have created it.<br>
9 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?<br>
10 Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?<br>
11 Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.<br>
12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.<br>

Isaiah 45: 3-12 NLT<br>
3<br>

I will do this so you may know that I am the Lord,<br>
the God of Israel, the one who calls you by name.<br>
4<br>
"And why have I called you for this work?<br>
Why did I call you by name when you did not know me?<br>
It is for the sake of Jacob my servant,<br>
Israel my chosen one.<br>
5<br>
I am the Lord;<br>
there is no other God.<br>
I have equipped you for battle,<br>

so all the world from east to west<br>

I am the Lord, and there is no other.<br>

I create the light and make the darkness.<br>
I send good times and bad times.<br>
I, the Lord, am the one who does these things.<br>

"What sorrow awaits those who argue with their Creator.<br>
Does a clay pot argue with its maker?<br>
Does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it, saying,<br>
'Stop, you're doing it wrong!'<br>
Does the pot exclaim,<br>
'How clumsy can you be?'<br>
10<br>
How terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father,<br>
'Why was I born?'<br>
or if it said to its mother,<br>
'Why did you make me this way?'"<br>

This is what the Lord says -- <br>
the Holy One of Israel and your Creator:<br>
"Do you question what I do for my children?<br>
Do you give me orders about the work of my hands?<br>

I am the one who made the earth<br>

With my hands I stretched out the heavens.<br>
All the stars are at my command.<br>

2 Timothy 2:24 (NLT)<br>
A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people.<br>
<br>
Titus 2:15 through chapter 3, verse 2 (NLT)<br>
15 You must teach these things and encourage the believers to do them. You have the authority to correct them when necessary, so don't let anyone disregard what you say.<br>
1 Remind the believers to submit to the government and its officers. They should be obedient, always ready to do what is good. <br>
2 They must not slander anyone and must avoid quarrelling. Instead, they should be gentle and show true humility to everyone.<br>

Galatians 1: 6-9 KJV<br>
6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<br>
7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br>
9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.<br>
<br>
Galatians 1: 6-9 NLT<br>
6 I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself (through loving mercy,) through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News <br>
7 but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ.<br>
8 Let God's curse fall on anyone, including us or even an angel from heaven, who preaches a different kind of Good News than the one we preached to you. <br>
9 I say again what we have said before: If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you welcomed, let that person be cursed.<br>

Revelation 22:1 (KJV)<br>
And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.<br>
<br>
Revelation 22: 1 & 2 NLT:<br>
1 Then the angel showed me a river with the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb. <br>
2 It flowed down the centre of the main street. On each side of the river grew a tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, (or twelve kinds of fruit,) with a fresh crop each month. The leaves were used for medicine to heal the nations.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 47: 1-7 KJV<br>
1 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.<br>
2 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.<br>
3 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; (waters of the ankles,) the waters were to the ankles.<br>
4 Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.<br>
5 Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, (waters of swimming,) waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.<br>
6 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.<br>
7 Now when I had returned, behold, (at the lip of the river,) at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 47: 1-7 NLT<br>
1 In my vision, the man brought me back to the entrance of the Temple. There I saw a stream flowing east from beneath the door of the Temple and passing to the right of the altar on its south side. <br>
2 The man brought me outside the wall through the north gateway and led me around to the eastern entrance. There I could see the water flowing out through the south side of the east gateway.<br>
3 Measuring as he went, he took me along the stream for 1,750 feet (1,000 cubits, or 530 metres) and then led me across. The water was up to my ankles. <br>
4 He measured off another 1,750 feet and led me across again. This time the water was up to my knees. After another 1,750 feet, it was up to my waist. <br>
5 Then he measured another 1,750 feet, and the river was too deep to walk across. It was deep enough to swim in, but too deep to walk through.<br>
6 He asked me, "Have you been watching, son of man?" Then he led me back along the riverbank. <br>
7 When I returned, I was surprised by the sight of many trees growing on both sides of the river.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  How deep do you want your Bible studies to go?<br>
How deep do you want your relationship to be with the Lord?<br>
Don't limit God by only going up to your ankles, and then stopping.<br>
The living water can't carry you to where it wants to take you, until you go deep enough, in over your head, no longer touching the bottom.<br>
No longer in control. God is in control. The Lord is on the throne. Go deeper.<br>
Then, the living water can take you to where it wants you to go, and then plant you like a tree next to the riverbank, a tree that always has easy access to water.<br>

Psalms 1: 2 & 3 KJV<br>
2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.<br>

Baptise<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 2:38 KJV<br>
...Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. <br>
<br>
Acts 2: 36-38 NLT<br>
36 "So let everyone in Israel know for certain that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, to be both Lord and Messiah!"<br>
37 Peter's words pierced their hearts, and they said to him and to the other apostles, "Brothers, what should we do?"<br>
38 Peter replied, "Each of you must repent of your sins and turn to God, and be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Strong's definition of Baptise:<br>
to immerse, submerge<br>
<br>
<br>
The following selected definitions came from the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries.<br>
<br>
immerse:<br>
to put someone or something deep into a liquid so that they are completely covered<br>
to dip it or them into or under the surface of a liquid completely.<br>
to baptise them by submerging their whole body in water.<br>
to put something or someone completely under the surface of a liquid.<br>
<br>
<br>
submerge:<br>
to cover something completely with water or another liquid<br>
to go under the surface of the water and be completely covered by it<br>
to plunge or sink or cause to plunge or sink under the surface of water or other liquid.<br>
to cover with water or other liquid.<br>
Cause someone or something to be under water.<br>
Descend below the surface of an area of water.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
An infant can't repent or change direction if it can't even talk or have an understanding of its need to repent from his or her sins.<br>
<br>
The Bible's definition of Baptism tell us that, if your church is trying to baptise infants by sprinkling water on them, that is not baptism, that church is doing it wrong, they are disobeying the Bible, and you should stay far away from churches that are operating in direct opposition to the Bible which they are not even bothering to read from cover to cover.<br>

Philippians 2: 2-18 KJV<br>
2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.<br>
3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<br>
4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.<br>
5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:<br>
6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:<br>
7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<br>
8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<br>
9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:<br>
10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;<br>
11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<br>
12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.<br>
13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.<br>
14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:<br>
15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, amongst whom ye shine as lights in the world;<br>
16 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.<br>
17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.<br>
18 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 1: verse 27 to verse 30, the end of chapter 1, and then we will keep on reading right into<br>
Philippians 2, until we get to verse 18. NLT<br>
27 Above all, you must live as citizens of heaven, conducting yourselves in a manner worthy of the Good News about Christ. Then, whether I come and see you again or only hear about you, I will know that you are standing together with one spirit and one purpose, fighting together for the faith, which is the Good News.<br>
28 Don't be intimidated in any way by your enemies. This will be a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed, but that you are going to be saved, even by God himself.<br>
29 For you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ but also the privilege of suffering for him.<br>
30 We are in this struggle together. You have seen my struggle in the past, and you know that I am still in the midst of it.<br>
1 Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ? Any comfort from his love? Any fellowship together in the Spirit? Are your hearts tender and compassionate?<br>
2 Then make me truly happy by agreeing wholeheartedly with each other, loving one another, and working together with one mind and purpose.<br>
3 Don't be selfish; don't try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves.<br>
4 Don't look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.<br>
5 You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.<br>
<br>
(Being in the form of God,)<br>
6<br>
Though he was God,<br>
he did not think of equality with God<br>
as something to cling to.<br>
7<br>
Instead, (he emptied himself,) he gave up his divine privileges;<br>
(he took the form of a slave,)<br>
he took the humble position of a slave<br>
and was born as a human being.<br>
When he appeared in human form,<br>
8<br>
he humbled himself in obedience to God<br>
and died a criminal's death on a cross.<br>
9<br>
Therefore, God elevated him to the place of highest honour<br>
and gave him the name above all other names,<br>
10<br>
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,<br>
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br>
11<br>
and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br>
to the glory of God the Father.<br>
12 Dear friends, you always followed my instructions when I was with you. And now that I am away, it is even more important. Work hard to show the results of your salvation, obeying God with deep reverence and fear.<br>
13 For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him.<br>
14 Do everything without complaining and arguing,<br>
15 so that no one can criticise you. Live clean, innocent lives as children of God, shining like bright lights in a world full of crooked and perverse people.<br>
16 Hold firmly to the word of life; then, on the day of Christ's return, I will be proud that I did not run the race in vain and that my work was not useless.<br>
<br>
(But I will rejoice even if I am to be poured out as a liquid offering.)<br>
17 But I will rejoice even if I lose my life, pouring it out like a liquid offering to God, just like your faithful service is an offering to God. And I want all of you to share that joy.<br>
18 Yes, you should rejoice, and I will share your joy.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are several very amazing and important things to study and think about in what we just read there in Philippians 2.<br>
Live as Citizens of Heaven, Have the Attitude of Christ, and Shine Brightly for Christ. Bow now or bow later.<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, we have here some Bible verses that talk about the outward appearance.<br>
We start by looking at a few verses in the book of 1 Samuel, chapter 16.<br>
This is the chapter that we have studied before, where Samuel Anoints David as King.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 16:7 (KJV)<br>
But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 16: 5-7 (NLT)<br>
...Samuel performed the purification rite for Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice, too.<br>
6 When they arrived, Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought, "Surely this is the Lord's anointed!"<br>
7 But the Lord said to Samuel, "Don't judge by his appearance or height, for I have rejected him. The Lord doesn't see things the way you see them. People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."<br>
<br>
Commentary: Jesse, sadly and foolishly, had judged his eight sons, and the son he thought had the least and lowest value, was actually the son that The Lord had chosen to be the next king of Israel.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 16: 10, 11 and then verse 13 (NLT)<br>
...All seven of Jesse's sons were presented to Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, "The Lord has not chosen any of these."<br>
11 Then Samuel asked, "Are these all the sons you have?"<br>
"There is still the youngest," Jesse replied. "But he's out in the fields watching the sheep and goats."<br>
"Send for him at once," Samuel said.<br>
And the Lord said, "This is the one; anoint him."<br>
13 So as David stood there amongst his brothers, Samuel took the flask of olive oil he had brought and anointed David with the oil. And the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David from that day on....<br>
<br>
And then, if we kept on reading that chapter, we would read about how David then Serves in King Saul's Court, playing the harp for King Saul.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 23: 27 & 28 (KJV)<br>
27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.<br>
28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the part of Matthew 23, where Jesus Criticises the Religious Leaders.<br>
<br>
Matthew 23: 25-28 NLT<br>
25 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filthy -- full of greed and self-indulgence!<br>
26 You blind Pharisee! First wash the inside of the cup and the dish, and then the outside will become clean, too.<br>
27 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs -- beautiful on the outside but filled on the inside with dead people's bones and all sorts of impurity.<br>
28 Outwardly you look like righteous people, but inwardly your hearts are filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3:3 (KJV)<br>
Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3: 3 & 4 (NLT)<br>
3 Don't be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewellery, or beautiful clothes.<br>
4 You should clothe yourselves instead with the beauty that comes from within....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 10:7 (KJV)<br>
Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 10:7 (NLT)<br>
(You look at things only on the basis of appearance.)<br>
7 Look at the obvious facts. Those who say they belong to Christ must recognise that we belong to Christ as much as they do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the lyrics from two older songs by Lecrae.<br>
We have mentioned Lecrae before, and we have looked at some of his song lyrics before as well.<br>
As always, you can always do a search for the artist's name and song title, and easily find websites that will play the entire song, instantly, for free.<br>
One popular example is doing a search like that at youtube.com.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, here are the lyrics of two older songs from the American Christian hip hop recording artist, songwriter, record producer, and actor, Lecrae.<br>
His full name is Lecrae Devaughn Moore.<br>
<br>
<br>
This first song is titled "Identity" (featuring Da' T.R.U.T.H. and J.R.), from his third studio album, Rebel, released by Reach Records on 30 September 2008.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2008 song, "Identity" by Lecrae.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hair, check!<br>
Shoes, check!<br>
A brand new fit, lookin' cool, check!<br>
I'm lookin' in the mirror like oooh, yes!<br>
To cover for an insecure dude, check!<br>
But she won't feel me and they won't like me<br>
If I ain't in them J's or them brand new Nikes<br>
Let's dig deeper inside my psyche<br>
When it's all said and done even I don't like me<br>
He live in the gym and his hair stay faded<br>
Late model car so they think he made it<br>
He's Christian, he gave his life<br>
But he still ain't satisfied in the saviour Christ<br>
Still finds his identity in looks and cars<br>
If he only knew that he ain't have to look so hard<br>
If he looked in God<br>
It may seem odd<br>
But he be so satisfied, he can leave it all<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not the shoes I wear<br>
I'm not the clothes I buy<br>
I'm not the house I live in<br>
I'm not the car I drive, no<br>
<br>
I'm not the job I work<br>
You can't define my worth<br>
By nothing on God's green earth<br>
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ<br>
<br>
<br>
Got her hair done, toes, nails<br>
Is that Her, well it's hard to tell<br>
Cause she's so caked up in all that make up<br>
It's like she trying make up for what she ain't but<br>
She's a saint, but so confused<br>
Cause she's been rejected by all these dudes<br>
That tell her on a scale of 10 she's a two<br>
But that ain't true<br>
If she only knew<br>
In Christ she is loved, she's secure and accepted<br>
Never be rejected by God whose elected her<br>
Her beauty is her Godliness<br>
And she ain't gotta flaunt it cause it's obvious<br>
Identity is found in the God we trust<br>
And any other identity will self destruct<br>
Identity is found in the God we trust<br>
And any other identity will self, dee-struct<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not the shoes I wear<br>
I'm not the clothes I buy<br>
I'm not the house I live in<br>
I'm not the car I drive, no<br>
<br>
I'm not the job I work<br>
You can't define my worth<br>
By nothing on God's green earth<br>
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey, how do I gauge success?<br>
What do I say? I'm blessed! huh<br>
Is it the car that I drive<br>
Or the place that<br>
I rest<br>
Or the way that I dress, now, now<br>
Is the cause of my pride<br>
The stage and the set<br>
Or my face in the press, now, now<br>
It's the applause that dies<br>
When the praise is less<br>
If my face is depressed, then, then<br>
It's cause my value and worth is in the volume of the work I produce in the booth<br>
It's a prize and a curse if defined by the perks when the truth is through<br>
Man I won't feel like I don't want to live no more, no more, no more<br>
Cause they don't like me, like they did in 04, 04, 04<br>
So I swallow my pride empowered by God, I'm complete in Him<br>
He's got peace, God's peace I'm in<br>
In His presence weak is strength<br>
Meet His kin<br>
Weakest brethren<br>
Read this list<br>
Me forgiven<br>
He's dismissed guilt and my sin<br>
And then I find my worth cause I'm Jesus' friend<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not the shoes I wear<br>
I'm not the clothes I buy<br>
I'm not the house I live in<br>
I'm not the car I drive, no<br>
<br>
I'm not the job I work<br>
You can't define my worth<br>
By nothing on God's green earth<br>
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The second song that we will look at here, are the words from the song, God is Enough.<br>
<br>
God is Enough is on Lecrae's fourth studio album, Rehab, which was released on 28 September 2010.<br>
"God is Enough" features performances by Flame and Jai.<br>
Here are the words to the 2010 song, God is Enough, by Lecrae.<br>
<br>
We so impressed With them ladies<br>
Who be drivin' Mercedes<br>
Who be drivin' them crazy<br>
And we gotta be crazy<br>
<br>
We so impressed With them fellas<br>
Who be makin' them jealous<br>
Who be makin' them stellas<br>
And we gotta be crazy<br>
I'm so impressed with the<br>
King who, on the throne<br>
Who left his heavenly home<br>
Never did a thing wrong<br>
They crucified him on<br>
A tree, that he made<br>
It was crazy how it set the stage<br>
For his resurrection from the grave<br>
That gets me amazed<br>
(You can be) the flyest man<br>
(With a) hundred grand in your hand<br>
Swag right, sag tight<br>
And a Gucci fan<br>
(You can) be the richest, be the smartest, be the hardest, all of that<br>
But I guarantee before I die they all are fallin' flat<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Used to want a lotta things<br>
All the stuff that's on TV<br>
Education, cars, and clothes<br>
Fashion lights and jewellery<br>
(Focused on the wrong stuff)<br>
Now I got my eyes on you<br>
And now I know that<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
You are enough-nough<br>
Never too much-much<br>
More than enough-nough<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
You are enough for me<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Party, like the fast life, hurry this the last flight<br>
Chasin' all your dreams, this right here could be your last night<br>
And man you finally got your cash right<br>
But it never seems to last right<br>
You know you sick of lookin', you sick of chasin'<br>
I think you know the truth, you just don't wanna face it<br>
Your life is empty, though you havin' fun<br>
You never satisfied, you never get enough<br>
You go from thrill-seekin' to pill-poppin'<br>
From heavy drinkin' to club-hoppin'<br>
You just can't stop it, like you're a slave<br>
And you chasin' nothin' all the way into the grave<br>
<br>
<br>
Used to want a lotta things<br>
All the stuff that's on TV<br>
Education, cars, and clothes<br>
Fashion lights and jewellery<br>
(Focused on the wrong stuff)<br>
Now I got my eyes on you<br>
And now I know that<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
You are enough-nough<br>
Never too much-much<br>
More than enough-nough<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
You are enough for me<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want<br>
Takes away my fears, you restore my soul<br>
Off into the sky, the dead in Christ arise<br>
To be with you forever, see with the clearest eyes<br>
Quench my inner thirst, there's something more in life<br>
No money, cars, relationships compare to joy in Christ<br>
Love that falls from selfish ones that like to front will self-destruct<br>
No need to strut, know what I want, to keep it, but my God's enough<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't need these worldly things, no<br>
I don't need these worldly things, no<br>
More of you and less of me, God<br>
More of you and less of me, God<br>
I don't need these worldly things, no<br>
I don't need these worldly things, no<br>
More of you and less of me, God<br>
More of you and less of me, God<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Used to want a lotta things<br>
All the stuff that's on TV<br>
Education, cars, and clothes<br>
Fashion lights and jewellery<br>
(Focused on the wrong stuff)<br>
Now I got my eyes on you<br>
And now I know that<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
You are enough-nough<br>
Never too much-much<br>
More than enough-nough<br>
God is enough-nough<br>
You are enough for me<br>
