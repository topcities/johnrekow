Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's begin by remembering a little detail taken from the beginning of the book of Genesis,<br>
about the story of The Man and Woman in Eden...<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:17 (KJV)<br>
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.<br>
<br>
and then, in chapter 5, we see this...<br>
<br>
Genesis 5:5 (NLT)<br>
Adam lived 930 years, and then he died.<br>
<br>
Nine hundred and thirty years is a bit longer than one day.<br>
Did we just find a contradiction in the Bible?<br>
If you were to read your entire Bible first, you eventually read this next part...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the New Testament,<br>
Peter writes in his second letter about how The Day of the Lord Is Coming...<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3:8 (KJV)<br>
But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.<br>
<br>
Peter is quoting from the Book of Jubilees.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of Jubilees is not in the Bible.<br>
The Book of Jubilees is also known as<br>
The Book of Division, or<br>
The Lesser Genesis, or the Little Genesis.<br>
<br>
<br>
Only about four copies of the Book of Jubilees<br>
were known to exist until 1947.<br>
They were the four complete Ge'ez texts also known as<br>
the Ethiopic Version.<br>
Those four copies were made in the 15th and 16th centuries.<br>
Then, between 1947 and 1956, 15 more copies were found<br>
in the Dead Sea Scrolls, written in Hebrew.<br>
The Ge'ez version, also known as the Ethiopic Version,<br>
is a Hebrew-to-Ethiopic translation written in an Ethiopian Semitic language,<br>
and has been shown to be an accurate translation when compared to<br>
the 15 Hebrew copies found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>
<br>
The original Hebrew copies of the Book of Jubilees may have been written<br>
sometime between 160 to 150 BC.<br>
<br>
<br>
Robert Henry (R. H.) Charles, was born in 1855, and he died in 1931.<br>
He translated The Ethiopic Version of the Hebrew Book of Jubilees, and first published an English translation in 1895.<br>
It was not the first English translation at that time, but this one still seems very popular even today.<br>
<br>
Most people even today like to read and quote from the<br>
R.H. (Robert Henry) Charles English Translation (1895, 1902, 1913, 1917)<br>
<br>
The book of Jubilees in the Eth Cepher is also based on this translation.<br>
<br>
Peter is remembering the Book of Jubilees 4: 29 & 30.<br>
<br>
Here is Jubilees 4: 29 & 30 from the<br>
R.H. (Robert Henry) Charles English Translation (1895, 1902, 1913, 1917)<br>
<br>
And at the close of the nineteenth jubilee, in the seventh week in the sixth year thereof, Adam died, and all his sons buried him in the land of his creation, and he was the first to be buried in the earth.<br>
And he lacked seventy years of one thousand years; for one thousand years are as one day in the testimony of the heavens and therefore was it written concerning the tree of knowledge: "On the day that ye eat thereof ye will die."<br>
For this reason he did not complete the years of this day; for he died during it.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Adam's death at seventy years short of a thousand is a literal fulfilment of the curse, in Genesis 2:17, because he did die in "the day" in which he ate the forbidden fruit, one day being with the Lord as a thousand years.<br>
In less than one so-called day, or less than 1000 years, Adam died.<br>
<br>
Any trained scholar can now look at the Hebrew copies from the Dead Sea Scrolls and make an English translation.<br>
A very similar English translation would be as follows...<br>
And at the end of the nineteenth jubilee in the seventh week, in the sixth year, Adam died.<br>
And all of his children buried him in the land of his creation.<br>
And he was the first who was buried in the earth.<br>
And he lacked seventy years from one thousand years, for a thousand years are like one day in the testimony of heaven and therefore it was written concerning the tree of knowledge, "In the day you eat from it you will die."<br>
Therefore he did not complete the years of this day because he died in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Before R.H. Charles, there was<br>
Another popular English translation by<br>
Reverend George Henry Schodde,<br>
Professor at Capital University, in Columbus, Ohio.<br>
This English translation was Published in 1888, which came out seven years earlier than the one by R.H. Charles.<br>
<br>
George Henry Schodde was born in 1854, and he died in 1917.<br>
The American, George Henry Schodde, was just a little more than 1 year and 3 months older than the British man, R.H. Charles.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jubilees 4: 29 & 30<br>
The verse numbering system is off by one in this other translation.<br>
What is verse 29 and 30 in the 1895 R.H. Charles version is verse 28 and 29 in this 1888 George Henry Schodde translation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jubilees 4: 28 & 29 -- George Henry Schodde English Translation<br>
<br>
28<br>
And at the end of the nineteenth jubilee, in the seventh week, in the sixth year thereof, Adam died, and all of his sons buried him in the land of the creation of Adam, and he was the first to be buried in the earth, and he lacked seventy years of one thousand years; for one thousand years are like one day in the testimony of heaven, and therefore it was written concerning the tree of knowledge: " On the day on which ye eat thereof ye shall die."<br>
29<br>
And for this reason he did not complete the years of this day; for in it he died.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, what may at first appear to be a contradiction, will pan out to be actually true, if you read your entire Bible from cover to cover.<br>
One who claims a Bible contradiction is the same one who has never carefully studied the entire Bible.<br>
If you woke up this morning, and you're still not yet in Heaven, then, keep on reading your Bible!<br>
Read your Bible and pray, every single day.<br>
You'll be glad you did, forever.<br>

Psalms 127, all of Psalms 127, all five verses -- KJV<br>
(Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain are builders of it in it:)<br>
127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.<br>
127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.<br>
127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.<br>
127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.<br>
<br>
(Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them: they shall not be ashamed,)<br>
(but they shall subdue the enemies in the gate.)<br>
(but they shall destroy the enemies in the gate.)<br>
127:5	Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 127, all of Psalms 127, all five verses -- NLT<br>
A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. A psalm of Solomon.<br>
1<br>
Unless the Lord builds a house,<br>
the work of the builders is wasted.<br>
Unless the Lord protects a city,<br>
guarding it with sentries will do no good.<br>
2<br>
It is useless for you to work so hard<br>
from early morning until late at night,<br>
anxiously working for food to eat;<br>
for God gives rest to his loved ones.<br>
3<br>
Children are a gift from the Lord;<br>
they are a reward from him.<br>
4<br>
Children born to a young man<br>
are like arrows in a warrior's hands.<br>
5<br>
How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them!<br>
He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 127, all of Psalms 127, all five verses -- TS2009<br>
1 If Yaw-Who-Wah does not build the house, Its builders have laboured in vain. If Yaw-Who-Wah does not guard the city, The watchman has stayed awake in vain.<br>
2 In vain do you rise up early, To sit up late, to eat the bread of toil; So He gives His beloved sleep.<br>
3 Look, children are an inheritance from Yaw-Who-Wah, The fruit of the womb is the reward.<br>
4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of one's youth.<br>
5 Blessed is the man Who has filled his quiver with them. They are not ashamed, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: If the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, were to give you a present, if He was to give you a gift, what would it be?<br>
There are many, many gifts that He can give any of us. Here, in this example, our Heavenly Father Yaw-Who-Wah is saying, I want you to have this precious gift.<br>
I am giving this gift to you. It's a present from me, to you.<br>
Here you go.<br>
Do not neglect the gift that I am giving you.<br>
<br>
Targeting again just verse 3...<br>
<br>
Psalms 127:3 (KJV)<br>
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: And the fruit of the womb is his reward.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 127:3 (TS2009)<br>
Look, children are an inheritance from Yaw-Who-Wah, The fruit of the womb is the reward.<br>
<br>
Psalms 127:3 (NLT)<br>
Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him.<br>
<br>
<br>
And finally, this little part of the verse that we see here, next, is being quoted out of context, but would sure apply to an expecting mother.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4:14 (KJV)<br>
Neglect not the gift that is in thee....<br>
<br>
(1 Timothy) 4:14 (TS2009)<br>
Do not neglect the gift that is in you....<br>
<br>
<br>
That chapter of 1 Timothy 4 was actually talking about Timothy being told to use his spiritual gifts as a church leader, giving him some advice on how to be A Good Servant of Christ Jesus (Muh-Shee-Uck Yaw-Who-Shaw).<br>

Psalms 144: 11-15 -- KJV<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:<br>
144:12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, (cut and) polished after the similitude of a palace:<br>
144:13 That our garners may be full, (affording from kind to kind) affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:<br>
(That our oxen may be able to bear burdens, That our oxen may be loaden with flesh)<br>
144:14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.<br>
144:15 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 144: 11-15 -- NLT<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
11<br>
Save me!<br>
Rescue me from the power of my enemies.<br>
Their mouths are full of lies;<br>
they swear to tell the truth, but they lie instead.<br>
12<br>
May our sons flourish in their youth<br>
like well-nurtured plants.<br>
May our daughters be like graceful pillars,<br>
carved to beautify a palace.<br>
13<br>
May our barns be filled<br>
with crops of every kind.<br>
May the flocks in our fields multiply by the thousands,<br>
even tens of thousands,<br>
14<br>
and may our oxen be loaded down with produce.<br>
May there be no enemy breaking through our walls,<br>
no going into captivity,<br>
no cries of alarm in our town squares.<br>
15<br>
Yes, joyful are those who live like this!<br>
Joyful indeed are those whose God is the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 144: 11-15 -- TS2009<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
11 Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, Whose mouth has spoken falsehood, And whose right hand is a right hand of lies;<br>
12 Because our sons are like plants Grown up in their youth; Our daughters like hewn stones, Polished, like a palace building;<br>
13 Let our storehouses be filled, Supplying all kinds; Let our sheep bring forth thousands And ten thousands in our fields;<br>
14 Our cattle well-laden; No breaking in, no going out; And no crying in our streets.<br>

Remembering again, something that we had looked at,<br>
in The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter Zero, Bonus 8...<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
There's The Way and there's A Way -- There's The Way to God and there's Away from God.<br>
There's The Way that is right, and there's a way that seems right.<br>
<br>
(John) 14:6 (TS2009)<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw said to him, "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:12 -- KJV<br>
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:12 (NLT)<br>
There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death.<br>
<br>
That verse gets repeated again in chapter 16, verse 25...<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:25 -- KJV<br>
There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:25 (NLT)<br>
There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 12:28 (NLT)<br>
The way of the godly leads to life; that path does not lead to death.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 12:28 (KJV)<br>
In the way of righteousness is life; And in the pathway thereof there is no death.<br>

<br>
<br>
Here is again, something that we were reading about,<br>
back when we did a Bible study, titled, Surefooted Or A Stumbling-Block,<br>
which was back in Christian Essays 20...<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24: 17 & 18 (KJV)<br>
24:17	Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:<br>
(Lest the LORD see it, and it be evil in his eyes)<br>
24:18	Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24: 17 & 18 -- NLT<br>
17<br>
Don't rejoice when your enemies fall;<br>
don't be happy when they stumble.<br>
18<br>
For the Lord will be displeased with you<br>
and will turn his anger away from them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 17:5 KJV<br>
Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:<br>
and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.<br>
(and he that is glad at calamities shall not be held innocent.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 17:5 (NLT)<br>
Those who mock the poor insult their Maker;<br>
those who rejoice at the misfortune of others will be punished.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Thinking about these verses here, it sounds like, if we rejoice when enemies fall and stumble on their misfortunes and calamities, if we do that, it sounds like, the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, will take his anger and wrath off of them, and put some form of punishment upon you or me, if we are being happy about those bad things happening to them. So, be careful about your emotional reaction to what you read about in the news. Those people, like you and like me, need salvation, forgiveness, help, grace and mercy.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:31 (KJV)<br>
He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker:<br>
But he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:31 (NLT)<br>
Those who oppress the poor insult their Maker, but helping the poor honours him.<br>

<br>
Discernment and Discretion<br>
<br>
As we will see here, next, the Hebrew word that is translated as, discretion, in the KJV, that same Hebrew word becomes, discernment, in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:125 (KJV)<br>
I am thy servant; give me understanding, That I may know thy testimonies.<br>

<br>
Proverbs 8:12 (NLT)<br>
"I, Wisdom, live together with good judgement. I know where to discover knowledge and discernment.<br>
<br>
<br>

Install this app into your heart, mind and soul, and do not limit or restrict its operation.<br>
Ask for this app and He will install it into you. All you have to do is ask, and believe that Yaw-Who-Shaw is your Master.<br>
The King who sits on the throne forever is also your friend.<br>
Also, read and study all of the Book of Proverbs, and try your best to obey it.<br>

Read one chapter each day for 31 days, and wisdom will stream into you.<br>

Commentary: Just because you have wisdom and knowledge does not mean that the other person wishes to receive it.  Some people are stupid, and they do not want to learn, or grow, or improve, or make any changes or improvements. Those people, the mockers and the wicked, they are stupid, and they are determined to stay stuck on stupid. They want to be stupid and stay stuck on stupid. Do not try to teach or correct stupid people that do not want to learn or make any changes. In many cases, you may have to just shut up, walk away, and stay away. At least you can keep on praying for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 9: 7-12 -- NLT<br>
7<br>
Anyone who rebukes a mocker will get an insult in return.<br>
Anyone who corrects the wicked will get hurt.<br>
8<br>
So don't bother correcting mockers;<br>
they will only hate you.<br>
But correct the wise,<br>
and they will love you.<br>
9<br>
Instruct the wise,<br>
and they will be even wiser.<br>
Teach the righteous,<br>
and they will learn even more.<br>
10<br>
Fear of the Lord is the foundation of wisdom.<br>
Knowledge of the Holy One results in good judgement.<br>
11<br>
Wisdom will multiply your days<br>
and add years to your life.<br>
12<br>
If you become wise, you will be the one to benefit.<br>
If you scorn wisdom, you will be the one to suffer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 23:9 (NLT)<br>
Don't waste your breath on fools, for they will despise the wisest advice.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 26:4 (NLT)<br>
Don't answer the foolish arguments of fools, or you will become as foolish as they are.<br>
<br>
(Proverbs) 28:4 (TS2009)<br>
Those who forsake the Torah praise the wrong, Those who guard the Torah strive with them.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:4 (NLT)<br>
To reject the law is to praise the wicked; to obey the law is to fight them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 20:24 (NLT)<br>
The LORD directs our steps, so why try to understand everything along the way?<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:26 (NLT)<br>
Those who trust their own insight are foolish, but anyone who walks in wisdom is safe.<br>

Romans 3:10 (KJV)<br>
As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<br>
<br>
Romans 3:23 (KJV)<br>
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br>
<br>
Romans 3:10 is quoting from Psalms 14:1-3 and from Psalms 53:1-3...<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 14: 1-3 -- KJV<br>
14:1	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.<br>
14:2	The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.<br>
14:3	They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy (and stinking): there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 53: 1-3 -- KJV<br>
53:1	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.<br>
53:2	God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.<br>
53:3	Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some words from King David's son, who ruled in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 7:20 (KJV)<br>
For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 7:20 (NLT)<br>
Not a single person on earth is always good and never sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 9: 9-12 -- KJV<br>
(See the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity,)<br>
(Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity,)<br>
9:9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.<br>
9:10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.<br>
9:11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.<br>
9:12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 9: 9-12 -- NLT<br>
9 Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil.<br>
10 Whatever you do, do well. (For when you go to Sheol,) For when you go to the grave, there will be no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom.<br>
11 I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn't always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn't always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skilful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don't always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time.<br>
12 People can never predict when hard times might come. Like fish in a net or birds in a trap, people are caught by sudden tragedy.<br>

Ezekiel 32: 1-9 -- KJV<br>
32:1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
32:2 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations,<br>
(and thou art as a dragon in the seas)<br>
and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.<br>
32:3 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.<br>
32:4 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.<br>
32:5 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.<br>
(I will also water with thy blood the land of thy swimming,)<br>
32:6 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.<br>
32:7 And when I shall put thee out,<br>
(And when I shall extinguish,)<br>
I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.<br>
(All the lights of the light in heaven will I make them dark, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.)<br>
32:8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.<br>
(I will also provoke to anger the hearts of many people,)<br>
(I will also grief the hearts of many people,)<br>
32:9 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction amongst the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.<br>
<br>
<br>
On the first day of the twelfth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar, this event occurred<br>
on 3 March 585 BC.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 32: 1-9 -- NLT<br>
1<br>
On the third day of March 585 BC, during the twelfth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity, this message came to me from the Lord:<br>
2<br>
"Son of man, mourn for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and give him this message:<br>
"You think of yourself as a strong young lion amongst the nations,<br>
but you are really just a sea monster,<br>
heaving around in your own rivers,<br>
stirring up mud with your feet.<br>
3<br>
Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says:<br>
I will send many people<br>
to catch you in my net<br>
and haul you out of the water.<br>
4<br>
I will leave you stranded on the land to die.<br>
All the birds of the heavens will land on you,<br>
and the wild animals of the whole earth<br>
will gorge themselves on you.<br>
5<br>
I will scatter your flesh on the hills<br>
and fill the valleys with your bones.<br>
6<br>
I will drench the earth with your gushing blood<br>
all the way to the mountains,<br>
filling the ravines to the brim.<br>
7<br>
When I blot you out,<br>
I will veil the heavens and darken the stars.<br>
I will cover the sun with a cloud,<br>
and the moon will not give you its light.<br>
8<br>
I will darken the bright stars overhead<br>
and cover your land in darkness.<br>
I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!<br>
9<br>
"I will disturb many hearts when I bring news of your downfall to distant nations you have never seen.<br>

<br>
Ezekiel 32: 1-9 -- TS2009<br>
1 And it came to be in the twelfth year, in the twelfth new moon, on the first of the new moon, that the word of Yaw-Who-Wah came to me, saying,<br>
2 "Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh sovereign of (Egypt) Mitsrayim (Meets-Rye-EEm), and you shall say to him, 'You were like a young lion amongst the nations, and you are like a monster in the seas, and you burst forth in your rivers, and trouble the waters with your feet, and muddy their rivers.'<br>
3 "Thus said the Master (Ah-Doh-Nye) Yaw-Who-Wah, 'And I shall spread My net over you with an assembly of many peoples, and they shall bring you up in My net.<br>
4 And I shall leave you on the land, hurl you out on the open fields, and make all the birds of the heavens dwell on you. And with you I shall satisfy the beasts of all the earth.<br>
5 And I shall put your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your height,<br>
6 and water the land with the flow of your blood unto the mountains, and let streams be filled with you.<br>
7 And when I extinguish you, I shall cover the heavens, and make its stars dark. I shall cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.<br>
8 All the bright lights of the heavens I shall make dark over you, and I shall bring darkness upon your land,' declares the Master (Ah-Doh-Nye) Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
9 And I shall trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction amongst the nations, into the lands which you have not known.<br>
<br>

Matthew 24: 29-35 -- KJV<br>
24:29	Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:<br>
24:30	And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.<br>
(And he shall send his angels with a Trumpet and a great voice,)<br>
24:31	And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.<br>
24:32	Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:<br>
24:33	So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.<br>
24:34	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.<br>
24:35	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 24: 29-44 -- NLT<br>
29<br>
"Immediately after the anguish of those days,<br>
the sun will be darkened,<br>
the moon will give no light,<br>
the stars will fall from the sky,<br>
and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.<br>
(Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, the Son of Man, is quoting from Isaiah 13:10; Isaiah 34:4; and from the book of Joel 2:10.)<br>
<br>
30 And then at last, the sign that the Son of Man is coming will appear in the heavens, and there will be deep mourning amongst all the peoples of the earth. And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.<br>
(Quoting from the vision found in the book of Daniel 7:13.)<br>
<br>
<br>
31 And he will send out his angels with the mighty blast of a trumpet, and they will gather his chosen ones (from the four winds) from all over the world -- from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven.<br>
32 "Now learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near.<br>
33 In the same way, when you see all these things, you can know his return is very near, right at the door.<br>
34 I tell you the truth, this generation (this age, this nation,) will not pass from the scene until all these things take place.<br>
<br>
35 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.<br>
36 "However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself.  Only the Father knows.<br>
37 "When the Son of Man returns, it will be like it was in Noah's day.<br>
38 In those days before the flood, the people were enjoying banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat.<br>
39 People didn't realise what was going to happen until the flood came and swept them all away. That is the way it will be when the Son of Man comes.<br>
40 "Two men will be working together in the field; one will be taken, the other left.<br>
41 Two women will be grinding flour at the mill; one will be taken, the other left.<br>
42 "So you, too, must keep watch! For you don't know what day your Lord is coming.<br>
43 Understand this: If a homeowner knew exactly when a burglar was coming, he would keep watch and not permit his house to be broken into.<br>
44 You also must be ready all the time, for the Son of Man will come when least expected.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Isaiah) 54:10 (TS2009)<br>
"For though the mountains be removed and the hills be shaken, My loving-commitment is not removed from you, nor is My covenant of peace shaken,” said Yaw-Who-Wah, who has compassion on you.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 54:10 (NLT)<br>
For the mountains may move and the hills disappear, but even then my faithful love for you will remain. My covenant of blessing will never be broken,” says the LORD, who has mercy on you.<br>

30:22 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.<br>

Isaiah 30: 18-22 -- NLT<br>
18<br>
So the Lord must wait for you to come to him<br>
so he can show you his love and compassion.<br>
For the Lord is a faithful God.<br>
Blessed are those who wait for his help.<br>
19<br>
O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem,<br>
you will weep no more.<br>
He will be gracious if you ask for help.<br>
He will surely respond to the sound of your cries.<br>
20<br>
Though the Lord gave you adversity for food<br>
and suffering for drink,<br>
he will still be with you to teach you.<br>
You will see your teacher with your own eyes.<br>
21<br>
Your own ears will hear him.<br>
Right behind you a voice will say,<br>
"This is the way you should go,"<br>
whether to the right or to the left.<br>
22<br>
Then you will destroy all your silver idols<br>
and your precious gold images.<br>
You will throw them out like filthy rags,<br>
saying to them, "Good riddance!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 30: 18-22 -- TS2009<br>
18 And therefore Yaw-Who-Wah shall wait, to show you favour. And therefore He shall be exalted, to have compassion on you. For Yaw-Who-Wah is an Elohim of right-ruling. Blessed are all those who wait for Him.<br>
19 For the people shall dwell in Tsiyon at Yerushalayim, you shall weep no more. He shall show much favour to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears, He shall answer you.<br>
20 Though Yaw-Who-Wah gave you bread of adversity and water of affliction, your Teacher shall no longer be hidden. But your eyes shall see your Teacher,<br>
21 and your ears hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the Way, walk in it," whenever you turn to the right, or whenever you turn to the left.<br>
22 And you shall defile the covering of your graven images of silver, and the plating of your moulded images of gold. You shall throw them away as a menstrual cloth and say to them, "Be gone!"<br>

<br>
<br>
Isaiah 19:20 (NLT)<br>

<br>
<br>
(Isaiah) 19:20 (TS2009)<br>

Isaiah 51: 11-16 -- KJV<br>
51:11 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.<br>
51:12 I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;<br>
51:13 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy?<br>
(because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he made himself ready to destroy?)<br>
and where is the fury of the oppressor?<br>
51:14 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.<br>
51:15 But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.<br>
51:16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 51: 11-16 -- NLT<br>
11<br>
Those who have been ransomed by the Lord will return.<br>
(They will enter Zion singing,)<br>
They will enter Jerusalem singing,<br>
crowned with everlasting joy.<br>
Sorrow and mourning will disappear,<br>
and they will be filled with joy and gladness.<br>
12<br>
"I, yes I, am the one who comforts you.<br>
So why are you afraid of mere humans,<br>
who wither like the grass and disappear?<br>
13<br>
Yet you have forgotten the Lord, your Creator,<br>
the one who stretched out the sky like a canopy<br>
and laid the foundations of the earth.<br>
Will you remain in constant dread of human oppressors?<br>
Will you continue to fear the anger of your enemies?<br>
Where is their fury and anger now?<br>
It is gone!<br>
14<br>
Soon all you captives will be released!<br>
Imprisonment, starvation, and death will not be your fate!<br>
15<br>
For I am the Lord your God,<br>
who stirs up the sea, causing its waves to roar.<br>
My name is the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>

And I have put my words in your mouth<br>
and hidden you safely in my hand.<br>
(I planted the sky like a canopy)<br>
I stretched out the sky like a canopy<br>

Isaiah 49: 1-18 -- KJV<br>
49:1 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.<br>
49:2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;<br>
<br>
49:3 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.<br>
<br>
49:4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgement is with the LORD, and my work with my God.<br>
(yet surely my judgement is with the LORD, and my reward with my God.)<br>
<br>
49:5 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him,<br>
(that Israel may be gathered to him, and I may be glorious in the eyes of the LORD,)<br>
Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.<br>
(And he said, art thou lighter, then that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the desolations of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.)<br>
49:6 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.<br>
<br>
49:7 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,<br>
(to him that is despised in soul,)<br>
to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.<br>
<br>
49:8 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to (raise up and) establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;<br>
<br>
49:9 That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.<br>
<br>
49:10 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.<br>
49:11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.<br>
49:12 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.<br>
49:13 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.
<br>
49:14 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.<br>
(Can a woman forget her sucking child, from having compassion on the son of her womb?)<br>
49:15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.<br>
<br>
49:16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.<br>
49:17 Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.<br>
49:18 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.<br>

<br>
<br>
Isaiah 49: 1-18 -- NLT<br>
1<br>
Listen to me, all you in distant lands!<br>
Pay attention, you who are far away!<br>
The Lord called me before my birth;<br>
from within the womb he called me by name.<br>
2<br>
He made my words of judgement as sharp as a sword.<br>
He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand.<br>
I am like a sharp arrow in his quiver.<br>
3<br>
He said to me, "You are my servant, Israel,<br>
and you will bring me glory."<br>
4<br>
I replied, "But my work seems so useless!<br>
I have spent my strength for nothing and to no purpose.<br>
Yet I leave it all in the Lord's hand;<br>
I will trust God for my reward."<br>
5<br>
And now the Lord speaks --<br>
the one who formed me in my mother's womb to be his servant,<br>
who commissioned me to bring Israel back to him.<br>
The Lord has honoured me,<br>
and my God has given me strength.<br>
6<br>
He says, "You will do more than restore the people of Israel to me.<br>
I will make you a light to the Gentiles,<br>
and you will bring my salvation to the ends of the earth."<br>
7<br>
The Lord, the Redeemer<br>
and Holy One of Israel,<br>
says to the one who is despised and rejected by the nations,<br>
to the one who is the servant of rulers:<br>
"Kings will stand at attention when you pass by.<br>
Princes will also bow low<br>
because of the Lord, the faithful one,<br>
the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you."<br>
8<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
("At just the right time, I heard you.)<br>
"At just the right time, I will respond to you.<br>
On the day of salvation I will help you.<br>
I will protect you and give you to the people<br>
as my covenant with them.<br>
Through you I will re-establish the land of Israel<br>
and assign it to its own people again.<br>
9<br>
I will say to the prisoners, 'Come out in freedom,'<br>
and to those in darkness, 'Come into the light.'<br>
They will be my sheep, grazing in green pastures<br>
and on hills that were previously bare.<br>
10<br>
They will neither hunger nor thirst.<br>
The searing sun will not reach them anymore.<br>
For the Lord in his mercy will lead them;<br>
he will lead them beside cool waters.<br>
11<br>
And I will make my mountains into level paths for them.<br>
The highways will be raised above the valleys.<br>
12<br>
See, my people will return from far away, from lands to the north and west, and from as far south as Egypt."<br>
(See, my people will return from far away, from the region of Sinim, and from the region of Aswan, which is in southern Egypt.")<br>
13<br>
Sing for joy, O heavens!<br>
Rejoice, O earth!<br>
Burst into song, O mountains!<br>
For the Lord has comforted his people<br>
and will have compassion on them in their suffering.<br>
14<br>
(Yet Zion says, "The Lord has deserted us;)<br>
Yet Jerusalem says, "The Lord has deserted us;<br>
the Lord has forgotten us."<br>
15<br>
"Never! Can a mother forget her nursing child?<br>
Can she feel no love for the child she has borne?<br>
But even if that were possible,<br>
I would not forget you!<br>
16<br>
See, I have written your name on the palms of my hands.<br>
Always in my mind is a picture of Jerusalem's walls in ruins.<br>
17<br>
Soon your descendants will come back,<br>
and all who are trying to destroy you will go away.<br>
18<br>
Look around you and see,<br>
for all your children will come back to you.<br>
As surely as I live," says the Lord,<br>
"they will be like jewels or bridal ornaments for you to display.<br>
<br>
<br>

Isaiah 49: 1-18 -- TS2009<br>
1 Listen to Me, O coastlands, and hear, you peoples from afar! Yaw-Who-Wah has called Me from the womb, from My mother's belly He has caused My Name to be remembered.<br>
2 And He made My mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of His hand He hid Me, and made Me a polished shaft. In His quiver He hid Me."<br>
3 And He said to Me, 'You are My servant, O Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), in whom I am adorned.'<br>
4 And I said, 'I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for emptiness, and in vain. But my right-ruling is with Yaw-Who-Wah, and my work with my Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem).' "<br>
5 And now said Yaw-Who-Wah  --  who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, to bring (Jacob) Yah-Coab back to Him, though Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) is not gathered to Him, yet I am esteemed in the eyes of Yaw-Who-Wah, and My Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem) has been My strength --<br>
6 and He says, "Shall it be a small matter for You to be My Servant to raise up the tribes of (Jacob) Yah-Coab, and to bring back the preserved ones of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL)? And I shall give You as a light to the nations, to be My deliverance to the ends of the earth!"<br>
7 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, the Redeemer of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), their Set-apart One, to the despised, to the loathed One of the nation, to the Servant of rulers, "Sovereigns shall see and arise, rulers also shall bow themselves, because of Yaw-Who-Wah who is steadfast, the Set-apart One of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL). And He has chosen You!"<br>
8 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, "In a favourable time I shall answer You, and in the day of deliverance I shall help You -- and I guard You and give You for a covenant of the people, to restore the earth, to cause them to inherit the ruined inheritances,<br>
9 to say to the prisoners, 'Go out,' to those who are in darkness, 'Show yourselves.' Let them feed on the ways, and let their pasture be on all bare hills.<br>
10 "They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither heat or sun strike them, for He who has compassion on them shall lead them, even by fountains of water guide them.<br>
11 "And I shall make all My mountains a way, and My highways raised up.<br>
12 "See, these come from far away, and see, those from the north and the west, and these from the land of Sinim."<br>
13 Sing, O heavens, rejoice, O earth! And break out in singing, O mountains! For Yaw-Who-Wah shall comfort His people and have compassion on His afflicted ones.<br>
14 But Tsiyon says, "Yaw-Who-Wah has forsaken me, and Yaw-Who-Wah has forgotten me."<br>
15 "Would a woman forget her nursing child, and not have compassion on the son of her womb? Though they forget, I never forget you.<br>
16 "See, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands; your walls are always before Me.<br>
17 "Your sons shall hurry, your destroyers and those who laid you waste depart from you.<br>
18 "Lift up your eyes round about and see, all of them gather together and come to you. As I live," declares Yaw-Who-Wah, "you shall put on all of them as an ornament, and bind them on you as a bride does.<br>

Commentary: As followers and believers, we are the Bride of Christ, and someday, instead of calling him the Lord, my master, my baal (my Buh-ALL), we will call him, my Husband.<br>
Here are the Bible verses that tell us all of this.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 11:2 (KJV)<br>
For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 11:2 (NLT)<br>
For I am jealous for you with the jealousy of God himself. I promised you as a pure bride to one husband -- Christ.<br>
<br>
(2 Corinthians) 11:2 (TS2009)<br>
For I am jealous for you with a jealousy according to Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem). For I gave you in marriage to one husband, to present you as an innocent maiden to Messiah.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 54: 4-6 -- KJV<br>
54:4 Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.<br>
54:5 For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.<br>
54:6 For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 54: 4-6 -- NLT<br>
4<br>
"Fear not; you will no longer live in shame.<br>
Don't be afraid; there is no more disgrace for you.<br>
You will no longer remember the shame of your youth<br>
and the sorrows of widowhood.<br>
5<br>
For your Creator will be your husband;<br>
the Lord of Heaven's Armies is his name!<br>
He is your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel,<br>
the God of all the earth.<br>
6<br>
For the Lord has called you back from your grief --<br>
as though you were a young wife abandoned by her husband,"<br>
says your God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 54: 4-6 -- TS2009<br>
4 "Do not fear, for you shall not be put to shame, nor hurt, you shall not be humiliated. For the shame of your youth you shall forget, and not remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.<br>
5 "For your Maker is your husband, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat is His Name, and the Set-apart One of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) is your Redeemer. He is called the Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem) of all the earth.<br>
6 "For Yaw-Who-Wah has called you like a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, like a wife of youth when you were refused," declares your Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem).<br>

Jeremiah 23:27 -- KJV<br>
23:27 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal (Buh-ALL).<br>
<br>
Commentary: Baal (Buh-ALL) means Master or Lord in Hebrew.<br>
Remember this! Again, Baal (Buh-ALL) means Master or Lord in Hebrew.<br>
Their fathers have forgotten the name of Yaw-Who-Wah for the Lord.<br>
As also mentioned in a random area near the end of Christian Essays 1, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 1,<br>
that's why English Bibles removed the name of Yaw-Who-Wah, and replaced it with The Lord, which would be in Hebrew, Baal (Buh-ALL), which is the name of a fake god.<br>
People have removed the name of the true and living God (ELL-Low-Heem) and have replaced it with the name of a fake god.<br>
That's why we see The Lord in our English Bibles, instead of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
He is going to fix this someday, as indicated in Hosea 2. We will take a look at that verse here, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 23: 26 & 27 -- NLT<br>
26 How long will this go on? If they are prophets, they are prophets of deceit, inventing everything they say.<br>
27 By telling these false dreams, they are trying to get my people to forget me, just as their ancestors did by worshiping the idols of Baal (Buh-ALL).<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 23:27 -- TS2009<br>
27 who try to make My people forget My Name by their dreams which everyone relates to his neighbour, as their fathers forgot My Name for Ba'al.<br>

Hosea 2: 16-17 -- KJV<br>
2:16 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.<br>
(And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me my husband; and shalt call me no more my Lord.)<br>
2:17 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 2: 16-17 -- NLT<br>
16<br>
"When that day comes," says the Lord,<br>
"you will call me 'my husband'<br>
instead of 'my master.' (my baal.)<br>
17<br>
O Israel, I will wipe the many names of Baal (Buh-ALL) from your lips,<br>
and you will never mention them again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 2: 16-17 -- TS2009<br>
16 "And it shall be, in that day," declares Yaw-Who-Wah, "that you call Me 'My Husband,' and no longer call Me 'My Ba'al.'<br>
17 "And I shall remove the names of the Ba'als from her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.<br>

Jeremiah 17: 5-15 -- KJV<br>
17:5 Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.<br>
17:6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.<br>
17:7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.<br>
17:8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green;<br>
(and shall not be careful in the year of restraint,)<br>
and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.<br>
17:9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?<br>
17:10 I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.<br>
(As the partridge gathereth young which she hath not brought forth;)<br>
17:11 As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.<br>
17:12 A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.<br>
17:13 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.<br>
17:14 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.<br>
17:15 Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17: 5-14 -- NLT<br>
5<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Cursed are those who put their trust in mere humans,<br>
who rely on human strength<br>
and turn their hearts away from the Lord.<br>
6<br>
They are like stunted shrubs in the desert,<br>
with no hope for the future.<br>
They will live in the barren wilderness,<br>
in an uninhabited salty land.<br>
7<br>
"But blessed are those who trust in the Lord<br>
and have made the Lord their hope and confidence.<br>
8<br>
They are like trees planted along a riverbank,<br>
with roots that reach deep into the water.<br>
Such trees are not bothered by the heat<br>
or worried by long months of drought.<br>
Their leaves stay green,<br>
and they never stop producing fruit.<br>
9<br>
"The human heart is the most deceitful of all things,<br>
and desperately wicked.<br>
Who really knows how bad it is?<br>
10<br>
But I, the Lord, search all hearts<br>
and examine secret motives.<br>
I give all people their due rewards,<br>
according to what their actions deserve."<br>
11<br>
Like a partridge that hatches eggs she has not laid,<br>
so are those who get their wealth by unjust means.<br>
At midlife they will lose their riches;<br>
in the end, they will become poor old fools.<br>
12<br>
But we worship at your throne --<br>
eternal, high, and glorious!<br>
13<br>
O Lord, the hope of Israel,<br>
all who turn away from you will be disgraced.<br>
They will be buried in the dust of the earth,<br>
for they have abandoned the Lord, the fountain of living water.<br>
14<br>
O Lord, if you heal me, I will be truly healed;<br>
if you save me, I will be truly saved.<br>
My praises are for you alone!<br>
<br>

Jeremiah 17: 5-15 -- TS2009<br>
5 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, "Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart turns away from Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
6 "For he shall be like a shrub in the desert, and not see when good comes, and shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land that is not inhabited.<br>
7 "Blessed is the man who trusts in Yaw-Who-Wah, and whose trust is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
8 "For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, which spreads out its roots by the river, and does not see when heat comes. And his leaf shall be green, and in the year of drought he is not anxious, nor does he cease from yielding fruit.<br>
9 "The heart is crooked above all, and desperately sick – who shall know it?<br>
10 "I, Yaw-Who-Wah, search the heart, I try the kidneys, and give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds.<br>
11 "As a partridge that broods but does not hatch, so is he who gets riches, but not by right. It leaves him in the midst of his days, and at his end he is a fool."<br>
12 An esteemed throne, exalted from the beginning, is the place of our set-apart place.<br>
13 O Yaw-Who-Wah, the expectation of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), all who forsake You are put to shame. "Those who depart from Me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Yaw-Who-Wah, the fountain of living waters."<br>
14 Heal me, O Yaw-Who-Wah, so that I am healed. Save me, so that I am saved, for You are my praise.<br>
15 See, they say to me, "Where is the word of Yaw-Who-Wah? Let it come now!"<br>
<br>
<br>
Remembering again, just verse 14 in the TS2009...<br>
Jeremiah 17:14 -- TS2009<br>
Heal me, O Yaw-Who-Wah, so that I am healed. Save me, so that I am saved, for You are my praise.<br>

Jeremiah 17:17 -- KJV<br>
Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.<br>

Lord, don't terrorise me!<br>
You alone are my hope in the day of disaster.<br>

Do not be a ruin to me, You are my shelter in the day of evil.<br>

Jeremiah 23: 34-40 -- KJV<br>
23:34 And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.<br>
(I will even visit upon that man and his house.)<br>
23:35 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?<br>
23:36 And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.<br>
23:37 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?<br>
23:38 But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD;<br>
23:39 Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:<br>
23:40 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 23: 34-40 -- NLT<br>
34 "If any prophet, priest, or anyone else says, 'I have a prophecy from the Lord,' I will punish that person along with his entire family.<br>
35 You should keep asking each other, 'What is the Lord's answer?' or 'What is the Lord saying?'<br>
36 But stop using this phrase, 'prophecy from the Lord.' For people are using it to give authority to their own ideas, turning upside down the words of our God, the living God, the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
37 "This is what you should say to the prophets: 'What is the Lord's answer?' or 'What is the Lord saying?'<br>
38 But suppose they respond, 'This is a prophecy from the Lord!' Then you should say, 'This is what the Lord says: Because you have used this phrase, "prophecy from the Lord," even though I warned you not to use it,<br>
39 I will forget you completely. I will expel you from my presence, along with this city that I gave to you and your ancestors.<br>
40 And I will make you an object of ridicule, and your name will be infamous throughout the ages.'<br>
<br>
In verse 39, there are some Hebrew manuscripts and a Greek version that, instead of saying, "I will forget you completely," they read, "I will surely lift you up."<br>
That is just something to be aware of, just in case you happen across translations from those manuscripts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 23: 34-40 -- TS2009<br>
34 "As for the prophet and the priest and the people who say, 'The message of Yaw-Who-Wah,' I shall punish that man and his house.<br>
35 "This is what each one says to his neighbour, and each one to his brother, 'What has Yaw-Who-Wah answered?' and, 'What has Yaw-Who-Wah spoken?'<br>
36 "But the message of Yaw-Who-Wah you no longer remember! For every man's message is his own word,<br>
(for you have overthrown the Words of the living ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, our ELL-Low-Heem!)<br>
for you have changed the Words of the living ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat, our ELL-Low-Heem!<br>
<br>
37 "This is what you say to the prophet, 'What has Yaw-Who-Wah answered you?' and, 'What has Yaw-Who-Wah spoken?'<br>
38 "But since you say, 'The message of Yaw-Who-Wah!' therefore thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, 'Because you say this word, "The message of Yaw-Who-Wah!" and I have sent to you, saying, "Do not say, 'The message of Yaw-Who-Wah!' "<br>
39 therefore see, I, I shall utterly forget you and cast you away from My presence, along with the city that I gave you and your fathers.<br>
40 And I shall put an everlasting reproach on you, and an everlasting shame that is not forgotten.' "<br>

In the poem that we will read next,<br>

<br>
What God Hath Promised<br>
<br>
by Annie Johnson Flint.<br>
<br>
<br>
God hath not promised skies always blue,<br>
Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through;<br>
God hath not promised sun without rain,<br>
Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
God hath not promised we shall not know<br>
Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;<br>
He hath not told us we shall not bear<br>
Many a burden, many a care.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,<br>
Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;<br>
Never a mountain, rocky and steep,<br>
Never a river, turbid and deep.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But God hath promised strength for the day,<br>
Rest for the labour, light for the way,<br>
Grace for the trials, help from above,<br>
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.<br>
<br>
But God has promised<br>
Strength from above<br>
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.<br>
<br>
But God has promised<br>
Peace from above<br>
Unfailing faithfulness, undying love.<br>

George Pope Morris<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This book is all that's left me now,<br>
Tears will unbidden start--<br>
With faltering lip and throbbing brow<br>
I press it to my heart.<br>
For many generations past,<br>
Here is our family tree;<br>
My mother's hand this Bible clasped;<br>
She, dying, gave it me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ah! well do I remember those<br>
Whose names these records bear,<br>
Who 'round the hearthstone used to close<br>
After the evening prayer,<br>
And speak of what these pages said,<br>
In tones my heart would thrill!<br>
Though they are with the silent dead<br>
Here are they living still!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My father read this holy book<br>
To brothers, sisters dear;<br>
How calm was my poor mother's look<br>
Who leaned God's word to hear!<br>
Her angel face -- I see it yet!<br>
What vivid memories come! --<br>
Again that little group is met<br>
Within the halls of home!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thou truest friend man ever knew,<br>
Thy constancy I've tried;<br>
Where all were false, I found thee true,<br>
My counsellor and guide.<br>
The mines of earth no treasure give<br>
That could this volume buy;<br>
In teaching me the way to live,<br>
It taught me how to die.<br>

Lord, let me live from day to day,<br>
In such a self-forgetful way,<br>
That even when I kneel to pray,<br>
My prayer shall be for OTHERS.<br>

<br>
<br>
Help me in all the work I do<br>
To ever be sincere and true,<br>
And know that all I'd do for you<br>
Must needs be done for OTHERS.<br>

<br>
<br>
Let "Self" be crucified and slain<br>
And buried deep: and all in vain<br>
May efforts be to rise again,<br>
Except to live for others.<br>

Let "Self" be crucified and slain<br>
And buried deep, nor rise again<br>
And may all efforts be in vain,<br>
Unless they be for OTHERS.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So when my work on earth is done,<br>
And my new work in heaven has begun,<br>
May I forget the crown I've won,<br>
While thinking still of OTHERS.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, others, Lord, yes, others,<br>
Let this my motto be;<br>
Help me to live for others,<br>
Help me to live for others,<br>
That I may live like Thee,<br>
That I may live like Thee.<br>

Here is a short item of interest.<br>
The original author is unknown.<br>
It may be found in the 1985 preface for The New Testament, in Bibles published by<br>
The Gideons International, from the National Publishing Company.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This Book contains the mind of God,<br>
the state of man,<br>
the way of salvation,<br>
the doom of sinners and the happiness of believers.<br>
Its doctrines are holy,<br>
its precepts are binding,<br>
its histories are true,<br>
and its decisions are immutable.<br>
<br>
Read it to be wise, believe it to be safe,<br>
and practice it to be holy.<br>
It contains light to direct you, food to support you,<br>
and comfort to cheer you.<br>
It is the traveller's map, the pilgrim's staff,<br>
the pilot's compass, the soldier's sword,<br>
and the Christian's character.<br>
<br>
Here paradise is restored, Heaven opened,<br>
and the gates of hell disclosed.<br>
Christ is its grand object; our good is its design,<br>
and the glory of God its end.<br>
It should fill the memory, rule the heart,<br>
and guide the feet.<br>
<br>
Read it slowly, frequently, and prayerfully.<br>
It is given you in life and will be opened in the judgement,<br>
and will be remembered forever.<br>
It involves the highest responsibility,<br>
will reward the greatest labour,<br>
and will condemn all who trifle with its sacred contents.<br>

Luke 11: 5-13 -- KJV<br>
11:5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;<br>
11:6 For a friend of mine in his journey<br>
(a friend of mine out of his way)<br>
is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?<br>
11:7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.<br>
11:8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.<br>
11:9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.<br>
11:10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.<br>
11:11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?<br>
11:12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?<br>
11:13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 11: 5-13 -- NLT<br>
5 Then, teaching them more about prayer, he used this story: "Suppose you went to a friend's house at midnight, wanting to borrow three loaves of bread. You say to him,<br>
6 'A friend of mine has just arrived for a visit, and I have nothing for him to eat.'<br>
7 And suppose he calls out from his bedroom, 'Don't bother me. The door is locked for the night, and my family and I are all in bed. I can't help you.'<br>
8 But I tell you this -- though he won't do it for friendship's sake, if you keep knocking long enough, he will get up and give you whatever you need because of your shameless persistence.<br>
(if you keep knocking long enough, he will get up and give you whatever you need in order to avoid shame, so his reputation won't be damaged.)<br>
<br>
9 "And so I tell you, keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.<br>
10 For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.<br>
("You fathers -- if your children, if they ask for bread, do you give them a stone?)<br>
11 "You fathers -- if your children ask for a fish, do you give them a snake instead?<br>
12 Or if they ask for an egg, do you give them a scorpion? Of course not!<br>
13 So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Son of Man" is a title that Jesus used for himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 18: 1-8 -- KJV<br>
18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;<br>
18:2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:<br>
18:3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.<br>
18:4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;<br>
18:5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.<br>
18:6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.<br>
18:7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?<br>
18:8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 18: 1-8 -- NLT<br>
1 One day Jesus told his disciples a story to show that they should always pray and never give up.<br>
2 "There was a judge in a certain city," he said, "who neither feared God nor cared about people.<br>
3 A widow of that city came to him repeatedly, saying, 'Give me justice in this dispute with my enemy.'<br>
4 The judge ignored her for a while, but finally he said to himself, 'I don't fear God or care about people,<br>
5 but this woman is driving me crazy. I'm going to see that she gets justice, because she is wearing me out with her constant requests!'"<br>
6 Then the Lord said, "Learn a lesson from this unjust judge.<br>
7 Even he rendered a just decision in the end. So don't you think God will surely give justice to his chosen people who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?<br>
8 I tell you, he will grant justice to them quickly! But when the Son of Man returns, how many will he find on the earth who have faith?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 18: 1-8 -- TS2009<br>
1 And He spoke a parable to them, that they should always pray and not lose heart,<br>
2 saying, "In a certain city there was a certain judge, not fearing ELL-Low-Heem nor regarding man.<br>
3 "And a widow was in that city, and she came to him, saying, 'Do right to me on my adversary.'<br>
4 And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within himself, 'Even if I do not fear ELL-Low-Heem nor regard man,"<br>
5 yet because this widow troubles me I shall do right to her, lest by her continual coming she wears me out.' "<br>
6 And the Master said, "Hear what the unrighteous judge said.<br>
7 "And shall ELL-Low-Heem not do right by all means to His own chosen ones who are crying out day and night to Him, and being patient over them?<br>
8 "I say to you that He shall do right to them speedily. But when the Son of Ah-Dome (Son of Adam, Son of Man) comes, shall He find the belief on the earth?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another example of Persistence is seen in the story of Samson and Delilah.<br>
Delilah's Persistence eventually caused Samson to share his secret with her.<br>
<br>
Judges 16:16 -- KJV<br>
16:16 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him,<br>
so that his soul was vexed unto death;<br>
(so that his soul was shortened unto death;)<br>
<br>
Judges 16:16 -- NLT<br>
16 She tormented him with her nagging day after day until he was sick to death of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Judges 16:16 -- TS2009<br>
16 And it came to be, when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, so that his being was wearied to death,<br>

As mentioned in the Bible Study, titled, Mourning,<br>
which was back in Christian Essays 6,<br>
also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 6,<br>
after the loss of our two old dogs in January 2019,<br>
one thing that helped us get through 2019 and 2020,<br>
was going out for the day, together as a family, and visiting a place called, Res-Q Ranch,<br>
which was east of Gold Hill, near Sams Valley, in Southern Oregon.<br>
Res-Q Ranch is a horse ranch and charity shop, operating as a non-profit corporation that would receive donations of leftover items that did not sell at yard sales, garage sales and estate sales,<br>
and they would then sell those donated items to help rehabilitate and rehome abused and neglected horses at their ranch.<br>
As a way to help us heal from our loss, we would go out there and spend some time, visiting, petting and feeding the horses.<br>
<br>
One day, I happened across a 1957 KJV Bible sitting amongst the stacks of donated books.<br>
I bought it, during one of our weekly visits, in 2019 or 2020.<br>
Finally, in April of 2023, I had decided to actually look through it from cover to cover.<br>
Apparently, it belonged to a lady named, Bertie L. Martin, who lived in Grants Pass, Oregon.<br>
She says that she got saved in April 1931.<br>
<br>
These recent studies shared with you here, and the collection of poems shared with you here on this page,<br>
were poems that she had taped or wrote into this 1957 KJV Bible.<br>
<br>
The next poem is the last poem to share with you from her Bible.<br>
Some of these poems were so important to her, that she had taped or paper-clipped a clipping of it at one end of the Bible,<br>
and she had hand-written the same poem a second time, in her own cursive handwriting, at the other end.<br>
One copy was found at the front, and the same poem was found again at the back.<br>
Or maybe it was the other way around. Maybe she hand-wrote it in the front first, and later found a clipping and<br>
put that second copy in the back. Anyway, these few selected poems seemed to be very important to her.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the last poem.<br>
There was a printed clip of this poem placed in the front of her Bible,<br>
and she also had it hand-written in her own cursive handwriting on a page at the back of her Bible.<br>
After I share this with you, we will review some Bible verses again<br>
that we looked at, back when we were doing the top 500 popular Bible verses,<br>
in The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter Zero, on the Parallel Bible page.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure how old this last poem is,<br>
and I was not able to find it anywhere on the Internet.<br>
The author is unknown.<br>
This poem is titled, Have Faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
Have Faith<br>
<br>
Faith when days are bright and sunny,<br>
Faith when hours are dark and long!<br>
Faith when things are going nicely,<br>
Faith when everything goes wrong!<br>

Faith when some may prove untrue!<br>
<br>
May God grant His special blessing<br>
Of enduring faith to you!<br>

Ezekiel 18: 20-32 -- NLT, 5th Edition<br>
20 The person who sins is the one who will die. The child will not be punished for the parent's sins, and the parent will not be punished for the child's sins. Righteous people will be rewarded for their own righteous behaviour, and wicked people will be punished for their own wickedness.<br>
21 But if wicked people turn away from all their sins and begin to obey my decrees and do what is just and right, they will surely live and not die.<br>
22 All their past sins will be forgotten, and they will live because of the righteous things they have done.<br>
23 "Do you think that I like to see wicked people die? says the Sovereign Lord. Of course not! I want them to turn from their wicked ways and live.<br>
24 However, if righteous people turn from their righteous behaviour and start doing sinful things and act like other sinners, should they be allowed to live? No, of course not! All their righteous acts will be forgotten, and they will die for their sins.<br>
25 "Yet you say, 'The Lord isn't doing what's right!' Listen to me, O people of Israel. Am I the one not doing what's right, or is it you?<br>
26 When righteous people turn from their righteous behaviour and start doing sinful things, they will die for it. Yes, they will die because of their sinful deeds.<br>
27 And if wicked people turn from their wickedness, obey the law, and do what is just and right, they will save their lives.<br>
28 They will live because they thought it over and decided to turn from their sins. Such people will not die.<br>
29 And yet the people of Israel keep saying, 'The Lord isn't doing what's right!' O people of Israel, it is you who are not doing what's right, not I.<br>
30 "Therefore, I will judge each of you, O people of Israel, according to your actions, says the Sovereign Lord. Repent, and turn from your sins. Don't let them destroy you!<br>
31 Put all your rebellion behind you, and find yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O people of Israel?<br>
32 I don't want you to die, says the Sovereign Lord. Turn back and live!<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 18: 20-32 -- TS2009<br>
20 "The being who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the crookedness of the father, nor the father bear the crookedness of the son. The righteousness of the righteous is upon himself, and the wrongness of the wrong is upon himself.<br>
21 "But the wrong, if he turns from all his sins which he has done, and he shall guard all My laws, and shall do right-ruling and righteousness, he shall certainly live, he shall not die.<br>
22 "All the transgressions which he has done shall not be remembered against him -- in his righteousness that he has done, he shall live.<br>
23 "Have I any pleasure in the death of the wrong?" declares the Master Yaw-Who-Wah. "Is it not that he should turn from his ways, and live?<br>
24 "But when a righteous one turns away from his righteousness and does unrighteousness, according to all the abominations that the wrong one has done, shall he live? All his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered. For his trespass which he has committed, and for his sin which he has committed, for them he shall die.<br>
25 "And you said, 'The way of Yaw-Who-Wah is not right.' Hear now, O house of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), is My way not right? Is it not your ways that are not right?<br>
26 "When a righteous one turns away from his righteousness, and does unrighteousness, and he dies in it, it is because of his unrighteousness which he has done that he dies.<br>
27 "And when the wrong turns away from the wrong which he has done, and he does right-ruling and righteousness, he keeps himself alive.<br>
28 "Because he sees and turns away from all the transgressions which he has done, he shall certainly live, he shall not die.<br>
29 "And the house of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) have said, 'The way of Yaw-Who-Wah is not right.' Are My ways not right, O house of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL)? Is it not your ways that are not right?<br>
30 "Therefore I judge you, O house of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), every one according to his ways," declares the Master Yaw-Who-Wah. "Repent, and turn back from all your transgressions, and let not crookedness be a stumbling-block to you.<br>
31 "Cast away from you all the transgressions, by which you have transgressed, and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O house of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL)?<br>
32 "For I have no pleasure in the death of one who dies," declares the Master Yaw-Who-Wah. "So turn back and live!"<br>

And all the trees will know that it is I, the Lord, who cuts the tall tree down and makes the short tree grow tall. It is I who makes the green tree wither and gives the dead tree new life. I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do what I said!"<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 17:24 -- TS2009<br>

We have also studied parts of John 15 when we did the Bible study, titled,<br>
Fruitful, in Christian Essays 8,<br>
and we share many samples of John 15 in random areas towards the end of Christian Essays 11.<br>
This next passage was also mentioned in a random area in Christian Essays 27.<br>
Let's study this again, and then enjoy reading the entire chapter in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 15: 9 & 10 -- KJV<br>
15:9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.<br>
15:10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love....<br>
<br>
<br>
John 15: 9 & 10 -- NLT, 5th Edition<br>
9 "I have loved you even as the Father has loved me. Remain in my love.<br>
10 When you obey my commandments, you remain in my love....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All of John 15, all 27 verses, every word of this all being spoken by Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-Shee-Uck -- NLT, 5th Edition<br>
and we will stop at verse 1 of chapter 16...<br>
1 "I am the true grapevine, and my Father is the gardener.<br>
2 He cuts off every branch of mine that doesn't produce fruit, and he prunes the branches that do bear fruit so they will produce even more.<br>
3 You have already been pruned and purified by the message I have given you.<br>
4 Remain in me, and I will remain in you. For a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed from the vine, and you cannot be fruitful unless you remain in me.<br>
5 "Yes, I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart from me you can do nothing.<br>
6 Anyone who does not remain in me is thrown away like a useless branch and withers. Such branches are gathered into a pile to be burned.<br>
7 But if you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it will be granted!<br>
8 When you produce much fruit, you are my true disciples. This brings great glory to my Father.<br>
9 "I have loved you even as the Father has loved me. Remain in my love.<br>
10 When you obey my commandments, you remain in my love, just as I obey my Father's commandments and remain in his love.<br>
11 I have told you these things so that you will be filled with my joy. Yes, your joy will overflow!<br>
12 This is my commandment: Love each other in the same way I have loved you.<br>
13 There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.<br>
14 You are my friends if you do what I command.<br>
15 I no longer call you slaves, because a master doesn't confide in his slaves. Now you are my friends, since I have told you everything the Father told me.<br>
16 You didn't choose me. I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for, using my name.<br>
17 This is my command: Love each other.<br>
18 "If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first.<br>
19 The world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it, but you are no longer part of the world. I chose you to come out of the world, so it hates you.<br>
20 Do you remember what I told you? 'A slave is not greater than the master.' Since they persecuted me, naturally they will persecute you. And if they had listened to me, they would listen to you.<br>
21 They will do all this to you because of me, for they have rejected the one who sent me.<br>
22 They would not be guilty if I had not come and spoken to them. But now they have no excuse for their sin.<br>
23 Anyone who hates me also hates my Father.<br>
24 If I hadn't done such miraculous signs amongst them that no one else could do, they would not be guilty. But as it is, they have seen everything I did, yet they still hate me and my Father.<br>
25 This fulfils what is written in their Scriptures: 'They hated me without cause.'<br>
(quoting from Psalms 35:19; and Psalms 69:4)<br>

The Book of John, chapters 14 and 15, is a very good place to read on a regular basis,<br>
as it contains a high concentration of many powerful Bible verses that connect<br>
His love and our successful relationship with the Father and the Son<br>
through faith, belief and Bible commandment obedience.<br>
<br>
We have just now read all of John Chapter 15 in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for John, Chapter 14,<br>
we seem to keep studying it here again and again.<br>
We looked at a big chunk of this John chapter 14,<br>
during a random moment in Christian Essays 10,<br>
and then we read all of Chapter 14<br>
at the very end of Christian Essays 15.<br>
A few key verses of John 14<br>
get looked at during a bible study, titled,<br>
Better Than Sacrifice<br>
which is over in Christian Essays 20,<br>
and we looked at a sample in the<br>

Commentary:<br>
I recently heard a story about someone at a church service, sharing a passage out of a letter of John,<br>
and then he found out that, about 25% of the church was totally lost and could not follow along<br>
in what he was reading, because in that church, about 25% of that church did not know that,<br>
in their Bible, there is a book of John, and there are also three letters of John,<br>
known as, One John, Two John, and Three John.<br>
<br>
Yes, the entire Word of God is written on your heart,<br>
but you can't bring all of those things into remembrance<br>
if you first don't put it into your rememberer.<br>
Read and study your entire Bible from cover to cover.<br>
If it has been more than five years since you read your entire Bible,<br>
then do it again.<br>
Go through the entire Bible.<br>
Go through the Bible, so that the Bible can go through you.<br>
Read your bible and pray, every, single, day.<br>

1 Peter 3:15 -- KJV<br>
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:<br>
<br>
(There are some manuscripts and translations that take the end of verse 15 and put it into verse 16.)<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3: 13-16 -- NLT<br>
13 Now, who will want to harm you if you are eager to do good?<br>
14 But even if you suffer for doing what is right, God will reward you for it. So don't worry or be afraid of their threats.<br>
15 Instead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it.<br>
But do this in a gentle and respectful way....<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3: 13-15 -- TS2009<br>
13 And who is the one doing evil to you, if you become imitators of the good?<br>
14 But even if you suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. "And do not fear their threats, neither be troubled."<br>
15 But set apart Yaw-Who-Wah ELL-Low-Heem in your hearts, and always be ready to give an answer to everyone asking you a reason concerning the expectation that is in you, with meekness and fear,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 4:2 (KJV)<br>
preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 4:2 -- NLT<br>
Preach the word of God. Be prepared, whether the time is favourable or not.<br>
Patiently correct, rebuke, and encourage your people with good teaching.<br>
<br>
<br>
Remembering again a little random moment from Christian Essays 22...<br>
By taking a quick look at the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins, and Oxford Dictionaries,<br>
we can combine what they all say, and say that the overall dictionary definition for the word, confute, is...<br>
to prove that a person or an argument is completely wrong or false;<br>
to prove (a person, an argument, or a theory) to be wrong, invalid, or mistaken.<br>
That is what the word, confute, means. That word, confute, is used in verse 2, in the TS2009.<br>
<br>
<br>
(2 Timothy) 4: 1-5 -- TS2009<br>
...I earnestly charge you:<br>
2 Proclaim the Word! Be urgent in season, out of season.<br>
(confute, prove them wrong)<br>
Convict, warn, appeal, with all patience and teaching.<br>
3 For there shall be a time when they shall not bear sound teaching, but according to their own desires, they shall heap up for themselves teachers tickling the ear,<br>
4 and they shall indeed turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to myths.<br>
5 But you be sober in all matters, suffer hardships, do the work of an evangelist, accomplish your service completely.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John Chapter 14 that we were talking about earlier, is a chapter in the Book of John.<br>
Let's now look at some verses from the letters of John...<br>
<br>
1 John 2: 3-6 -- NLT<br>
3 And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.<br>
4 If someone claims, "I know God," but doesn't obey God's commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth.<br>
5 But those who obey God's word truly show how completely they love him. That is how we know we are living in him.<br>
6 Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.<br>
<br>
1 John 3:11 (NLT)<br>
This is the message you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another.<br>
<br>
2 John 1:5 (NLT)<br>
I am writing to remind you, dear friends, that we should love one another. This is not a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning.<br>
<br>
2 John 1:6 (NLT)<br>
Love means doing what God has commanded us, and he has commanded us to love one another, just as you heard from the beginning.<br>
<br>
2 John 1:6 (KJV)<br>
1:6 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.<br>
<br>
2 John 1:6 (TS2009)<br>
And this is the love, that we walk according to His commands. This is the command, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Love means doing what God has commanded us.<br>
We walk after his commandments as you have heard from the beginning.<br>
The beginning goes all the way back to the beginning,<br>
and the beginning of your Bible is at the beginning.<br>
Start at the beginning, Genesis 1:1,<br>
and obey every Torah law and commandment given to you,<br>
and every command you have been taught from the beginning.<br>
Starting at the beginning of your Bible, start on and after Genesis 1:1,<br>
read it, study it, guard it, keep it, walk in it, do it and obey it.<br>
This concept of commandment obedience, which is to obey the law of Torah,<br>
includes all laws and commandments in the Old Testament.<br>
This could be why John places a strong emphasis with commandment obedience<br>
which includes all commands and laws in Torah, going all the way back to the beginning.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 6:64 (NLT)<br>
But some of you do not believe me." (For Jesus knew from the beginning which ones didn't believe, and he knew who would betray him.)<br>
<br>
1 John 2:24 (NLT)<br>
So you must remain faithful to what you have been taught from the beginning. If you do, you will remain in fellowship with the Son and with the Father.<br>
<br>
1 John 2:24 -- KJV<br>
Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.<br>
<br>
And now let's end this study by going to the beginning...<br>
<br>
Genesis 1:1 -- KJV<br>
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.<br>

Hebrews 4:16 -- KJV<br>
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:16 -- NLT<br>
So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:16 -- TS2009<br>

There are some people that are going to show up in heaven, and they will be told this...<br>
<br>
Matthew 7:23 (KJV)<br>
And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 13:27 (KJV)<br>
But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This message, depart from me, ye that work iniquity,<br>
is something that we saw in<br>
Christian Essays 2<br>
in Matthew 7,<br>
<br>
and even more so when we examined this in<br>
Christian Essays 18<br>
we saw that message there in<br>
Psalms 6<br>
Matthew 7, and in<br>
Luke 13.<br>
<br>
We will take another look at this message, depart from me, ye that work iniquity,<br>
here in just a moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 1 & 2 (NLT)<br>
1 "Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.<br>
(For God will judge you as you judge others.)<br>
2 For you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged.<br>
(The measure you give will be the measure you get back.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 6:37 -- KJV<br>
Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 6: 36-38 -- NLT<br>
36 You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.<br>
37 "Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, or it will all come back against you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven.<br>
38 Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full -- pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap.<br>
The amount you give will determine the amount you get back."<br>
(The measure you give will be the measure you get back.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 7:8 -- KJV<br>
The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.<br>
<br>
1 John 1:9 -- KJV<br>
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:32 -- KJV<br>
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.<br>

How do you first receive His love?<br>
<br>
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br>
-- Romans 10:9 (KJV)<br>
<br>
If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved.<br>
-- Romans 10: 9 & 10 (NLT)<br>
<br>
How do you stay in love with Him, and remain in love with Him?<br>
Obey His Commandments.<br>

Remembering again a little random moment from Christian Essays 12...<br>
Ezekiel 36: 25-29 NLT<br>
25 "Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship idols.<br>
<br>
26 And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart.<br>
(I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a heart of flesh.)<br>
<br>
27 And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.<br>
28 "And you will live in Israel, the land I gave your ancestors long ago. You will be my people, and I will be your God.<br>
29 I will cleanse you of your filthy behaviour.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
If we take what we just read here, and also remember the Gospel, we have a list...<br>
1. Receive, accept and believe that Jesus is Lord -- Romans 10:9<br>
2. Pray and ask the Lord Jesus to enter into your heart and mind and soul<br>
3. Verse 25 -- He cleans you<br>
4. He remodels you, constructs you, and re-constructs you, doing demolition, remodelling, doing a new creating and constructing of you from within.<br>
5. Verse 26 -- He gives you a new heart and a new spirit<br>
6. Verse 27 -- He puts His Holy Spirit within you<br>
7. With His Holy Spirit, you can now follow, obey, guard, keep and actually do the Bible, the Torah, the Commandments.<br>
<br>
Again, step 7 is when he gives you the ability to obey and keep his commandments.<br>
You can't do step 7, until he does step 7.<br>
You can't do step 7, until you let Him first do steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.<br>
Having trouble doing step 7? Go back and start with step 1, and pray in step 1.<br>
He's the one that does all of these steps, not you.<br>
He does all of this first, then you can observe, guard, keep and obey the Bible, the Torah, the Commandments.<br>
We have the Commandments of the Lord given to Moses in the Old Testament,<br>
and we have the Commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament.<br>
You can do all things through Christ, but without Christ, you can do nothing.<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:13 KJV<br>
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br>
<br>
John 15:5 (KJV)<br>
...without me ye can do nothing.<br>
<br>
He is the builder; you are the building.<br>
He is pottery maker, and you are the lump of clay.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's think again about a Commentary that was said in Christian Essays 7.<br>
Sin can be like a pit. Once you fall in, you can get stuck in it, and it can be hard to climb out of that pit.<br>
Some people give-up trying to get out of their pit of sin, and they stay there, and live there, and they decorate it with nice furniture.<br>
<br>
There is a difference between a safety net and a trampoline.<br>
The Lord can be your safety net, but He will not allow you to use him as a trampoline.<br>
Sometimes we accidentally fall into that pit of sin, but then there are those who deliberately jump into sin.<br>
The Lord will be our safety net for when we accidentally fall into a pit of sin, but he will not keep on being a trampoline for those who want to keep on jumping into sin.<br>
Gossip is one of those things that people do when they decide to continue to keep on practising sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
That Commentary, from Christian Essays 7, was used in the Bible study,<br>
Controlling the Tongue<br>
which looked at the serious sin of gossip and rumours.<br>
<br>
What we learned in that study and saw in the Bible, was basically this...<br>
Commentary: The Bible teaches us that, one of the ways how we can help to control our tongue, is to avoid talebearing, being a tale-bearer, and to avoid the spreading of gossip and rumours.<br>
In other words, avoid judging other people that are not there, with you, and avoid talking about someone if that person is not there, in the same room with you at that time. Can you think of something nice to say about that person instead?<br>
Pray for that person instead, and pray about your attitude, and what you are feeling in your heart towards that person.<br>
Fire, plus fire, firing back, equals more fire. Don't feed the fire. Don't respond to a fire by adding more fire to it. Stop fuelling around with fire!<br>
May the Lord bless and protect your relationship with that other person, and may the Lord bless and protect the relationship that this other person has with the Lord, Jesus Christ, and that we would both receive wisdom, repentance, deliverance, salvation, and forgiveness.<br>
In Jesus' Name, Amen.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:28 (KJV)<br>
A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:28 NLT<br>
A troublemaker plants seeds of strife;<br>
gossip separates the best of friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 26:20 -- NLT<br>
Fire goes out without wood,<br>
and quarrels disappear when gossip stops.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 20:19 -- NLT<br>
A gossip goes around telling secrets,<br>
so don't hang around with chatterers.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the Torah, we have this commandment, this law that must be obeyed...<br>
<br>
Leviticus 19:16 -- NLT<br>
Do not spread slanderous gossip amongst your people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 6:8 -- KJV<br>
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;....<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7:23 (KJV)<br>
And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 13:27 (KJV)<br>
But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
ye that work iniquity<br>
ye workers of iniquity<br>
a manufacturer of sin<br>
When you work and make sin, you work and make iniquity, making you a worker of iniquity.<br>
Is that you?  Is that me?<br>
Your sins separate you from God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 21-23 NLT<br>
21 "Not everyone who calls out to me, 'Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.<br>
22 On judgement day many will say to me, 'Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.'<br>
23 But I will reply, 'I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God's laws.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 13 22-30 NLT<br>
22 Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he went, always pressing on toward Jerusalem.<br>
23 Someone asked him, "Lord, will only a few be saved?"<br>
He replied,<br>
24 "Work hard to enter the narrow door to God's Kingdom, for many will try to enter but will fail.<br>
25 When the master of the house has locked the door, it will be too late. You will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Lord, open the door for us!' But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'<br>
26 Then you will say, 'But we ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'<br>
27 And he will reply, 'I tell you, I don't know you or where you come from. Get away from me, all you who do evil.'<br>
28 "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, for you will see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, but you will be thrown out.<br>
29 And people will come from all over the world -- from east and west, north and south -- to take their places in the Kingdom of God.<br>
30 And note this: Some who seem least important now will be the greatest then, and some who are the greatest now will be least important then."<br>
(And note this: Some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7, verses 21 and 22, and,<br>
Luke 13, verse 25, in the KJV, these three verses all say,<br>
Lord, Lord.<br>
All three of these verses, where they say, Lord, Lord.<br>
The Greek word being used there, is pronounced, Key-Dee-Ohs.<br>
Today, this Greek word is used today as a respectful way of saying, Mister.<br>
It means, a lord, a master, having power, supreme in authority,<br>
who has control and has power of deciding.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Does it sound like I have an actual relationship with someone if, instead of calling them by their actual name,<br>
I call out to them and say,<br>
Hey mister!<br>
Hey you!<br>
Hey mate!<br>
Hey man!<br>
Hey dude!<br>
<br>
Do you even know his name?<br>
<br>
Psalms 9:10 -- KJV<br>
And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.<br>
<br>
Psalms 9:10 -- TS2009<br>
And those who know Your Name trust in You, For You have not forsaken those who seek You, O Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Let's say I want some man to be the next President of the United States.<br>
I wear a T-shirt with His face and name on it.<br>
I hand out buttons, writing pens, pins and badges with his face and name on it.<br>
I hand out free coffee cups and T-shirts with his name on it.<br>
I hand out literature and other papers with his name on it.<br>
I say nice and supportive things about him on social media.<br>
He ends up becoming the elected president, all from a totally fair and honest voting system in the Untied States.<br>
<br>
You instantly recognise his face and the sound of his voice.<br>
Just because you recognise his face and the sound of his voice, does that mean that you actually have a relationship with him?<br>
He does not even know what your name is. He's never even seen you before, ever.<br>
<br>
I walk up to him, maybe at the place where he is staying.<br>
I say, hey! I'm here! Nice to see you! Let me see this cool place that you have here. What's for dinner?<br>
<br>
He says, I'm sorry, but you're going to have to leave. I don't know you, and I've never had any friendship or relationship with you. My Secret service agents will now assist you in leaving the premises.<br>
<br>
But I say, but I wore your T-shirt with your face and name on it, I handed out coffee cups and papers and said really nice and supportive things about you on social media!<br>
Didn't I do all those things, in your name?<br>
<br>
And he says, Yeah, that's nice, and I still do not know you, and I've never known you, ever, so leave now!<br>
<br>
<br>
Will that happen to you when you go to heaven?<br>
Will that happen to me?<br>
Where do people go when they can't go to heaven?<br>
Hell is actual, real place!<br>
<br>
What would cause us to receive a message like that?<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59: 1-4 (KJV)<br>
1 Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:<br>
2 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, (your sins have made him hide his face from you) that he will not hear.<br>
3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.<br>
4 None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59<br>
NLT of verses 1 through 4<br>
1<br>
Listen! The Lord's arm is not too weak to save you,<br>
nor is his ear too deaf to hear you call.<br>
2<br>
It's your sins that have cut you off from God.<br>
Because of your sins, he has turned away<br>
and will not listen anymore.<br>
3<br>
Your hands are the hands of murderers,<br>
and your fingers are filthy with sin.<br>
Your lips are full of lies,<br>
and your mouth spews corruption.<br>
4<br>
No one cares about being fair and honest.<br>
The people's lawsuits are based on lies.<br>
They conceive evil deeds<br>
and then give birth to sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 3:4 (KJV)<br>
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.<br>

1 John 3:4 (NLT)<br>
Everyone who sins is breaking God's law, for all sin is contrary to the law of God.<br>
<br>
(1 John) 3:4 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (1993, 2009, 2015)<br>
Everyone doing sin also does lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:9 -- TS2009<br>
He who turns away his ear from hearing the Torah, Even his prayer is an abomination.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:9 (KJV)<br>
He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:9 -- NLT:<br>
God detests the prayers<br>
of a person who ignores the law.<br>
<br>
<br>
How do we avoid Him saying that to us -- depart from me, ye that work iniquity?<br>
How do we avoid Him saying that to you and to me?<br>
How do we make sure He does not say to us,<br>
I never knew you: depart from me<br>
<br>
Well, we should know Him.<br>
He can't say that He does not know us if He knows us and we know Him.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 1:12 -- KJV<br>
...I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed....<br>
<br>
Nahum 1:7 -- KJV<br>
The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2:19 -- KJV<br>
Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2:19 -- NLT<br>
But God's truth stands firm like a foundation stone with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," and "All who belong to the Lord must turn away from evil."<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2:19 is quoting from Numbers 16:5 and and is referencing Isaiah 52:11.<br>
<br>
Numbers 16:5 -- NLT<br>
(God has visited and knows those who are his.)<br>
...the Lord will show us who belongs to him and who is holy.<br>
The Lord will allow only those whom he selects to enter his own presence.<br>
<br>
When you know him, you will have the ability to love...<br>
<br>
1 John 4:7 -- KJV<br>
Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<br>
<br>
Philippians 3:10 -- KJV<br>
That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe this concept is something like this...<br>
He does not know you because you are not his friend.<br>
How do you be his friend?<br>
<br>
Here is a hint. He laid down His life for you and for me on the Cross.<br>
He made your interests more important than His own.<br>
Take other people's needs and interests, and make them more important than your own, personal, selfish, needs and interests.<br>
Live your life for Him.<br>
Pray this...<br>
Lord, what do you want me to do for you today?<br>

to receive glory and honour and power.<br>
For you created all things,<br>
and they exist because you created what you pleased."<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:13 (KJV)<br>
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:13 -- NLT:<br>
For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The reason why you exist is to give Him pleasure.<br>
He gives you and works into you the desire and the ability to give Him pleasure.<br>
What have you done today that would give God pleasure?<br>
Lord, what do you want me to do for you today?<br>
Set aside your personal selfish life, and lay down your life for your friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 15:13 -- KJV<br>
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<br>

<br>
John 14: verse 15, verse 21, and verses 23 and 24, all being read here together...<br>
NLT<br>
<br>
(If you love me, you will obey my commandments. If you love me, you should obey my commandments.)<br>
15 "If you love me, obey my commandments.<br>
<br>
21 Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them."<br>
<br>
23 Jesus replied, "All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.<br>
24 Anyone who doesn't love me will not obey me. And remember, my words are not my own. What I am telling you is from the Father who sent me.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 15:13 -- KJV<br>
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 15: 9-17 -- NLT, 5th Edition<br>
9 "I have loved you even as the Father has loved me. Remain in my love.<br>
10 When you obey my commandments, you remain in my love, just as I obey my Father's commandments and remain in his love.<br>
11 I have told you these things so that you will be filled with my joy. Yes, your joy will overflow!<br>
12 This is my commandment: Love each other in the same way I have loved you.<br>
13 There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.<br>
14 You are my friends if you do what I command.<br>
15 I no longer call you slaves, because a master doesn't confide in his slaves. Now you are my friends, since I have told you everything the Father told me.<br>
16 You didn't choose me. I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for, using my name.<br>
17 This is my command: Love each other.<br>
<br>

We looked at these two greatest commandments when we did our study on<br>
Commandments<br>
back in<br>
Christian Essays 3...<br>
<br>
Matthew 22: 35-40 (NLT)<br>
35 One of them, an expert in religious law, tried to trap him with this question:<br>
36 "Teacher, which is the most important commandment in the law of Moses?"<br>
37 Jesus replied, "'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)<br>
38 This is the first and greatest commandment.<br>
39 A second is equally important: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)<br>
40 The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments."<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 22: 35-40 -- TS2009<br>
35 and one of them, one learned in the Torah, did question, trying Him, and saying,<br>
36 Teacher, which is the great command in the Torah?<br>
37 And Yaw-Who-Shaw said to him, " 'You shall love Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem with all your heart, and with all your being, and with all your mind.'<br>
38 "This is the first and great command.<br>
39 And the second is like it, 'You shall love your neighbour as yourself.'<br>
40 On these two commands hang all the Torah and the Prophets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 4: 7 & 8<br>
was mentioned in a Bible study, titled,<br>
Light and Darkness<br>
which was in<br>
Christian Essays 5.<br>
<br>
1 John 4: 7 & 8 KJV<br>
7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<br>
8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for God is ELL-Low-Heem, and in the TS2009, it is spelled like this, E L O H I M.<br>
In the Eth Cepther, ELL-Low-Heem would be spelled with a Y instead of an I, like this, E L O H Y M.<br>
<br>
1 John 4: 7-11 -- TS2009<br>
7 Beloved ones, let us love one another, because love is of Elohim, and everyone who loves has been born of Elohim, and knows Elohim.<br>
8 The one who does not love does not know Elohim, for Elohim is love.<br>
9 By this the love of Elohim was manifested in us, that Elohim has sent His only brought-forth Son into the world, in order that we might live through Him.<br>
10 In this is love, not that we loved Elohim, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be an atoning offering for our sins.<br>
11 Beloved ones, if Elohim so loved us, we also ought to love one another.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
We are to love one another.<br>
It does not say that they will love us back.<br>
It does not say to wait around for them to love you first, and then you can love them back.<br>
They can't love us back if they do not have God, ELL-Low-Heem, living in their hearts because, ELL-Low-Heem is love.<br>
God and love are the same thing. Love is actually God, and God is actually love.<br>
Love and God are the same thing.<br>
God is love. Love is a quality and characteristic of God.<br>
Do apples come from grocery stores and supermarkets?<br>
They do, up to a certain, limited amount thereof, but if you really want to go directly to the source, apples really come from apple trees in orchards.<br>
Does love come from your pet, or a human, a parent, grandparent, husband, wife, boyfriend or girlfriend?<br>
Love can, up to a certain, limited amount thereof, but if you really want to go directly to the source, love really comes from God, because God is love.<br>
If you also want good, God is good. He is also our hope, our salvation, and many more things, and God is love.<br>
One of the two Greatest Commandments is, You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.<br>
Not with some of your heart, not with half of your heart, not with most of your heart, but with ALL of your heart AND soul AND mind!<br>
If you want more love, put more ELL-Low-Heem into your heart, and you will have more love in your heart.<br>
If you want more love, then get more ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
To increase the love in you, put more God in you.<br>
He wants to live in you and fill you with his Holy Spirit.<br>
To get more love into you, put more ELL-Low-Heem into you.<br>
He will give you a new heart, a clean heart.<br>
You just do the sin confessing and ELL-low-Heem will do the sin cleaning.<br>
You just point out what needs fixing and cleaning, and he will do the remodelling job and the cleaning job in your heart, mind, body, soul and life.<br>
He wants to bless you and heal you.<br>
<br>
Does He know you? Are you His friend?<br>
He showed his love for you on the cross.<br>
He loves you.<br>
Do you love Him?<br>
Let Him and his love enter into you, so that you can enter into his kingdom.<br>
<br>
Matthew 18:3 -- KJV<br>
And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br>
<br>
Luke 13:24 (NLT)<br>
"Work hard to enter the narrow door to God's Kingdom, for many will try to enter but will fail.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:3 (NLT)<br>
For only we who believe can enter his rest. As for the others, God said,<br>
"In my anger I took an oath:<br>
'They will never enter my place of rest,'"<br>
even though this rest has been ready since he made the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7:21 (NLT)<br>
"Not everyone who calls out to me, 'Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 26:2 (NLT)<br>
Open the gates to all who are righteous;<br>
allow the faithful to enter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 118:20 (NLT)<br>
These gates lead to the presence of the Lord,<br>
and the godly enter there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 18:24 (NLT)<br>
When Jesus saw this, he said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!<br>
<br>
Mark 10:23 (NLT)<br>
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!"<br>
<br>
<br>
Remembering again, a verse mentioned in the Bible study, The Hired and The Prodigal,<br>
which is in Christian Essays 6...<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 16: 49 & 50 -- NLT<br>
49 Sodom's sins were pride, gluttony, and laziness, whilst the poor and needy suffered outside her door.<br>
50 She was proud and committed detestable sins, so I wiped her out, as you have seen.<br>
(so I wiped her out, as I have seen.)<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 16: 49 & 50 -- TS2009<br>
49 "See, this was the crookedness of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, sufficiency of bread, and unconcerned ease. And she did not help the poor and needy.<br>
50 "And they were haughty and did abomination before Me, and I took them away when I saw it.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 1:9 -- TS2009<br>
If we confess our sins, He is trustworthy and righteous to forgive us the sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:19 (NLT)<br>
And so, dear brothers and sisters, we can boldly enter heaven's Most Holy Place because of the blood of Jesus.<br>
<br>
Romans 10: 9 & 10 -- TS2009<br>
That if you confess with your mouth the Master Yaw-Who-Shaw and believe in your heart that ELL-Low-Heem has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.<br>
For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, and so is saved.<br>

Here is a prayer based on wording found in the book of<br>
Jubilees, chapter 12, verses 19 through 21, in the Eth Cepher...<br>
<br>
Heavenly Father, Beloved Son,<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah is the most high God.<br>
The most high God, the most high ELL-Low-Heem, is ELL-ELLE-On.<br>
My ELL-Low-Heem, ELL-ELLE-On,<br>
All things are in your hand.<br>
You alone are my ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
You and your dominion have I chosen.<br>
I choose to be under your authority, to live and be under You and your dominion.<br>
All things are the works of your hands.<br>
Deliver me and rescue me from the hands of all evil spirits who have<br>
dominion over the thoughts of people's hearts.<br>
Do not let any of these evil spirits lead me astray from you, my ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
Establish me and my family and my future descendants, that we not go astray, today, every day and forevermore.<br>
<br>
If a fruit is taken off the tree too soon, due to impatience, it will not be good and safe to eat.<br>
If I wait too long, and the time of perfect ripeness comes and goes, and I take it off the tree too late, it will lose its value, and will not be good and safe to eat.<br>
I need to take the right actions at the right time, and be in the right place at the right time.<br>
The right place at the right time can be physical, geographical, emotional, spiritual, or even in the form of electronic technology and communications.<br>
Looking at the right content at the right time, using technology, so that the moment is profitable, resulting in prosperity and success,<br>
only you can help me with wisdom and actions such as this.<br>
<br>
Should I return to a place of the past, or should I move into a place that has been unknown to me?<br>
Should I return to a place that was once comfortable and familiar to me, or should I flee from it?<br>
You say to not look back and to remember Lot's wife.<br>
<br>
I remember some words from the 2015 song, Trust In You, by Lauren Daigle,<br>
all of which are shared on Christian Essays 14...<br>
<br>
Truth is You know what tomorrow brings<br>
There's not a day ahead You have not seen<br>
Your ways are always higher<br>
Your plans are always good<br>
There's not a place where I'll go<br>
You've not already stood<br>
<br>
<br>
Prepare the next campsite for me,<br>
and prepare me for the next campsite.<br>
Help me know if I should stop or go, if I should go straight ahead, or if I should turn left or right, or if I should remain here or move away, or go forward, or return back.<br>
And help me have wisdom so that I do not go too fast and get there too early, and help me not move too slowly, and get there too late.<br>
This good wisdom from above, is how I find and get and keep and remain upon what you define as the right path, according to your perfect will.<br>
<br>
According to your will, this right path that you define, this right path is before me,<br>
may you prosper it before the hands of your servant,<br>
that your servant may fulfil it.<br>
Help me to remain upon it with the perfect speed, perfect quality, precision and accuracy,<br>
and may I never walk in the deceitfulness of my heart.<br>
Rebuke and cast out all selfishness, and all deceitfulness in my heart,<br>
and continually perform this for me, and my family and my future descendants, all days, all hours and in all places and circumstances, My ELL-Low-Heem, ELL-ELLE-On,<br>
in the name of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-main.<br>
<br>

<br>
And, whilst we are here in Jubilees chapter 12,<br>
here is another learning opportunity for you and for me...<br>
Jubilees chapter 12<br>
R.H. (Robert Henry) Charles English Translation (1895, 1902, 1913, 1917)<br>
Some selected portions from verses 1 through 11.<br>
Here is is a short edit of what is going on in this chapter...<br>
Abram said to Terah his father,<br>
What help and profit have we from those idols which thou dost worship,<br>
For there is no spirit in them,<br>
For they are dumb forms, and a misleading of the heart.<br>
Worship them not:<br>
...ye have no help from them,<br>
<br>
...they are a great cause of shame to those who make them,<br>
And a misleading of the heart to those who worship them:<br>
Worship them not."<br>
verse 6...<br>
6. And his father said unto him, "I also know it, my son, but what shall I do with a people who have made me to serve before them?<br>
7. And if I tell them the truth, they will slay me; for their soul cleaveth to them to worship them and honour them.<br>
Keep silent, my son, lest they slay thee."<br>
<br>
Verse 11...<br>
Abram arose by night, and burned the house of the idols, and he burned all that was in the house, and no man knew it.<br>
<br>
<br>
In The Ten Commandments, the very first two Commandments are...<br>
Exodus chapter 20, verses 3, 4, and 5...<br>
3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<br>
4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:<br>
5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Abram's father is another example of someone who decided to obey the commands of someone other than the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
Abram's father obeys the demands of the people (worship these idols) instead of the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah's commandment.<br>
Adam obeys Eve (Eat this) instead of the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah's commandment.<br>
King Saul obeys the demands of the people (don't kill them all) instead of the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah's commandment.<br>
King David covets a neighbour's wife (Bathsheba) instead of obeying the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah's commandment.<br>
King Solomon decided to obey his many wives (make me a fake god altar) instead of obeying the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah's commandment.<br>
A man of God from Judah obeyed some random stranger (spend the night with me here) instead of obeying the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah's commandment.<br>
And in Jasher 78:9...<br>
Moses circumcised not his (son's) foreskin, at the command of Reuel his father-in-law.<br>
Moses obeying his father-in-law instead of the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah's commandment.<br>
<br>
How many more examples do we need before we say and pray,<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, help me obey every one of the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah's commandments.<br>
We thankfully receive your forgiveness, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-main.<br>
