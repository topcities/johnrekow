Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's begin by remembering a little detail taken from the beginning of the book of Genesis,<br>
about the story of The Man and Woman in Eden...<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:17 (KJV)<br>
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.<br>
<br>
and then, in chapter 5, we see this...<br>
<br>
Genesis 5:5 (NLT)<br>
Adam lived 930 years, and then he died.<br>
<br>
Nine hundred and thirty years is a bit longer than one day.<br>
Did we just find a contradiction in the Bible?<br>
If you were to read your entire Bible first, you eventually read this next part...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the New Testament,<br>
Peter writes in his second letter about how The Day of the Lord Is Coming...<br>
<br>
2 Peter 3:8 (KJV)<br>
But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.<br>
<br>
Peter is quoting from the Book of Jubilees.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of Jubilees is not in the Bible.<br>
The Book of Jubilees is also known as<br>
The Book of Division, or<br>
The Lesser Genesis, or the Little Genesis.<br>
<br>
<br>
Only about four copies of the Book of Jubilees<br>
were known to exist until 1947.<br>
They were the four complete Ge'ez texts also known as<br>
the Ethiopic Version.<br>
Those four copies were made in the 15th and 16th centuries.<br>
Then, between 1947 and 1956, 15 more copies were found<br>
in the Dead Sea Scrolls, written in Hebrew.<br>
The Ge'ez version, also known as the Ethiopic Version,<br>
is a Hebrew-to-Ethiopic translation written in an Ethiopian Semitic language,<br>
and has been shown to be an accurate translation when compared to<br>
the 15 Hebrew copies found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>
<br>
The original Hebrew copies of the Book of Jubilees may have been written<br>
sometime between 160 to 150 BC.<br>
<br>
<br>
Robert Henry (R. H.) Charles, was born in 1855, and he died in 1931.<br>
He translated The Ethiopic Version of the Hebrew Book of Jubilees, and first published an English translation in 1895.<br>
It was not the first English translation at that time, but this one still seems very popular even today.<br>
<br>
Most people even today like to read and quote from the<br>
R.H. (Robert Henry) Charles English Translation (1895, 1902, 1913, 1917)<br>
<br>
The book of Jubilees in the Eth Cepher is also based on this translation.<br>
<br>
Peter is remembering the Book of Jubilees 4: 29 & 30.<br>
<br>
Here is Jubilees 4: 29 & 30 from the<br>
R.H. (Robert Henry) Charles English Translation (1895, 1902, 1913, 1917)<br>
<br>
And at the close of the nineteenth jubilee, in the seventh week in the sixth year thereof, Adam died, and all his sons buried him in the land of his creation, and he was the first to be buried in the earth.<br>
And he lacked seventy years of one thousand years; for one thousand years are as one day in the testimony of the heavens and therefore was it written concerning the tree of knowledge: "On the day that ye eat thereof ye will die."<br>
For this reason he did not complete the years of this day; for he died during it.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Adam's death at seventy years short of a thousand is a literal fulfilment of the curse, in Genesis 2:17, because he did die in "the day" in which he ate the forbidden fruit, one day being with the Lord as a thousand years.<br>
In less than one so-called day, or less than 1000 years, Adam died.<br>
<br>
Any trained scholar can now look at the Hebrew copies from the Dead Sea Scrolls and make an English translation.<br>
A very similar English translation would be as follows...<br>
And at the end of the nineteenth jubilee in the seventh week, in the sixth year, Adam died.<br>
And all of his children buried him in the land of his creation.<br>
And he was the first who was buried in the earth.<br>
And he lacked seventy years from one thousand years, for a thousand years are like one day in the testimony of heaven and therefore it was written concerning the tree of knowledge, "In the day you eat from it you will die."<br>
Therefore he did not complete the years of this day because he died in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Before R.H. Charles, there was<br>
Another popular English translation by<br>
Reverend George Henry Schodde,<br>
Professor at Capital University, in Columbus, Ohio.<br>
This English translation was Published in 1888, which came out seven years earlier than the one by R.H. Charles.<br>
<br>
George Henry Schodde was born in 1854, and he died in 1917.<br>
The American, George Henry Schodde, was just a little more than 1 year and 3 months older than the British man, R.H. Charles.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jubilees 4: 29 & 30<br>
The verse numbering system is off by one in this other translation.<br>
What is verse 29 and 30 in the 1895 R.H. Charles version is verse 28 and 29 in this 1888 George Henry Schodde translation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jubilees 4: 28 & 29 -- George Henry Schodde English Translation<br>
<br>
28<br>
And at the end of the nineteenth jubilee, in the seventh week, in the sixth year thereof, Adam died, and all of his sons buried him in the land of the creation of Adam, and he was the first to be buried in the earth, and he lacked seventy years of one thousand years; for one thousand years are like one day in the testimony of heaven, and therefore it was written concerning the tree of knowledge: " On the day on which ye eat thereof ye shall die."<br>
29<br>
And for this reason he did not complete the years of this day; for in it he died.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, what may at first appear to be a contradiction, will pan out to be actually true, if you read your entire Bible from cover to cover.<br>
One who claims a Bible contradiction is the same one who has never carefully studied the entire Bible.<br>
If you woke up this morning, and you're still not yet in Heaven, then, keep on reading your Bible!<br>
Read your Bible and pray, every single day.<br>
You'll be glad you did, forever.<br>

Psalms 127, all of Psalms 127, all five verses -- KJV<br>
(Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain are builders of it in it:)<br>
127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.<br>
127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.<br>
127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.<br>
127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.<br>
<br>
(Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver with them: they shall not be ashamed,)<br>
(but they shall subdue the enemies in the gate.)<br>
(but they shall destroy the enemies in the gate.)<br>
127:5	Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 127, all of Psalms 127, all five verses -- NLT<br>
A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. A psalm of Solomon.<br>
1<br>
Unless the Lord builds a house,<br>
the work of the builders is wasted.<br>
Unless the Lord protects a city,<br>
guarding it with sentries will do no good.<br>
2<br>
It is useless for you to work so hard<br>
from early morning until late at night,<br>
anxiously working for food to eat;<br>
for God gives rest to his loved ones.<br>
3<br>
Children are a gift from the Lord;<br>
they are a reward from him.<br>
4<br>
Children born to a young man<br>
are like arrows in a warrior's hands.<br>
5<br>
How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them!<br>
He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 127, all of Psalms 127, all five verses -- TS2009<br>
1 If Yaw-Who-Wah does not build the house, Its builders have laboured in vain. If Yaw-Who-Wah does not guard the city, The watchman has stayed awake in vain.<br>
2 In vain do you rise up early, To sit up late, to eat the bread of toil; So He gives His beloved sleep.<br>
3 Look, children are an inheritance from Yaw-Who-Wah, The fruit of the womb is the reward.<br>
4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of one's youth.<br>
5 Blessed is the man Who has filled his quiver with them. They are not ashamed, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: If the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, were to give you a present, if He was to give you a gift, what would it be?<br>
There are many, many gifts that He can give any of us. Here, in this example, our Heavenly Father Yaw-Who-Wah is saying, I want you to have this precious gift.<br>
I am giving this gift to you. It's a present from me, to you.<br>
Here you go.<br>
Do not neglect the gift that I am giving you.<br>
<br>
Targeting again just verse 3...<br>
<br>
Psalm 127:3 (KJV)<br>
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: And the fruit of the womb is his reward.<br>
<br>
(Psalms) 127:3 (TS2009)<br>
Look, children are an inheritance from Yaw-Who-Wah, The fruit of the womb is the reward.<br>
<br>
Psalms 127:3 (NLT)<br>
Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him.<br>
<br>
<br>
And finally, this little part of the verse that we see here, next, is being quoted out of context, but would sure apply to an expecting mother.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4:14 (KJV)<br>
Neglect not the gift that is in thee....<br>
<br>
(1 Timothy) 4:14 (TS2009)<br>
Do not neglect the gift that is in you....<br>
<br>
<br>
That chapter of 1 Timothy 4 was actually talking about Timothy being told to use his spiritual gifts as a church leader, giving him some advice on how to be A Good Servant of Christ Jesus (Muh-Shee-Uck Yaw-Who-Shaw).<br>

Psalms 144: 11-15 -- KJV<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:<br>
144:12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, (cut and) polished after the similitude of a palace:<br>
144:13 That our garners may be full, (affording from kind to kind) affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:<br>
(That our oxen may be able to bear burdens, That our oxen may be loaden with flesh)<br>
144:14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.<br>
144:15 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 144: 11-15 -- NLT<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
11<br>
Save me!<br>
Rescue me from the power of my enemies.<br>
Their mouths are full of lies;<br>
they swear to tell the truth, but they lie instead.<br>
12<br>
May our sons flourish in their youth<br>
like well-nurtured plants.<br>
May our daughters be like graceful pillars,<br>
carved to beautify a palace.<br>
13<br>
May our barns be filled<br>
with crops of every kind.<br>
May the flocks in our fields multiply by the thousands,<br>
even tens of thousands,<br>
14<br>
and may our oxen be loaded down with produce.<br>
May there be no enemy breaking through our walls,<br>
no going into captivity,<br>
no cries of alarm in our town squares.<br>
15<br>
Yes, joyful are those who live like this!<br>
Joyful indeed are those whose God is the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 144: 11-15 -- TS2009<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
11 Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, Whose mouth has spoken falsehood, And whose right hand is a right hand of lies;<br>
12 Because our sons are like plants Grown up in their youth; Our daughters like hewn stones, Polished, like a palace building;<br>
13 Let our storehouses be filled, Supplying all kinds; Let our sheep bring forth thousands And ten thousands in our fields;<br>
14 Our cattle well-laden; No breaking in, no going out; And no crying in our streets.<br>

Remembering again, something that we had looked at,<br>
in The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter Zero, Bonus 8...<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
There's The Way and there's A Way -- There's The Way to God and there's Away from God.<br>
There's The Way that is right, and there's a way that seems right.<br>
<br>
(John) 14:6 (TS2009)<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw said to him, "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:12 -- KJV<br>
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:12 (NLT)<br>
There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death.<br>
<br>
That verse gets repeated again in chapter 16, verse 25...<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:25 -- KJV<br>
There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:25 (NLT)<br>
There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 12:28 (NLT)<br>
The way of the godly leads to life; that path does not lead to death.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 12:28 (KJV)<br>
In the way of righteousness is life; And in the pathway thereof there is no death.<br>

<br>
Here is again, something that we were reading about,<br>
back when we did a Bible study, titled, Surefooted Or A Stumbling-Block,<br>
which was back in Christian Essays 20...<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24: 17 & 18 (KJV)<br>
24:17	Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:<br>
(Lest the LORD see it, and it be evil in his eyes)<br>
24:18	Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24: 17 & 18 -- NLT<br>
17<br>
Don't rejoice when your enemies fall;<br>
don't be happy when they stumble.<br>
18<br>
For the Lord will be displeased with you<br>
and will turn his anger away from them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 17:5 KJV<br>
Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:<br>
and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.<br>
(and he that is glad at calamities shall not be held innocent.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 17:5 (NLT)<br>
Those who mock the poor insult their Maker;<br>
those who rejoice at the misfortune of others will be punished.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Thinking about these verses here, it sounds like, if we rejoice when enemies fall and stumble on their misfortunes and calamities, if we do that, it sounds like, the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, will take his anger and wrath off of them, and put some form of punishment upon you or me, if we are being happy about those bad things happening to them. So, be careful about your emotional reaction to what you read about in the news. Those people, like you and like me, need salvation, forgiveness, help, grace and mercy.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:31 (KJV)<br>
He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker:<br>
But he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:31 (NLT)<br>
Those who oppress the poor insult their Maker, but helping the poor honours him.<br>

<br>
<br>
Discernment and Discretion<br>
<br>
As we will see here, next, the Hebrew word that is translated as, discretion, in the KJV, that same Hebrew word becomes, discernment, in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalm 119:125 (KJV)<br>
I am thy servant; give me understanding, That I may know thy testimonies.<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:125 (NLT)<br>
Give discernment to me, your servant; then I will understand your laws.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 1:4 (KJV)<br>
To give subtilty to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 1:4 (NLT)<br>
These proverbs will give insight to the simple, knowledge and discernment to the young.<br>

My child, don't lose sight of common sense and discernment. Hang on to them<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 8:12 (KJV)<br>
I wisdom dwell with prudence, And find out knowledge of witty inventions.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 8:12 (NLT)<br>
"I, Wisdom, live together with good judgement. I know where to discover knowledge and discernment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:11 (KJV)<br>
The rich man is wise in his own conceit; But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:11 (NLT)<br>
Rich people may think they are wise, but a poor person with discernment can see right through them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Commentary: In conclusion, if you want to have the strong powers of discernment and discretion,<br>
receive knowledge and wisdom from the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
He will put wisdom into you. He can stream it into you.<br>
Install the app known as the Holy Spirit.<br>
Install this app into your heart, mind and soul, and do not limit or restrict its operation.<br>
Ask for this app and He will install it into you. All you have to do is ask, and believe that Yaw-Who-Shaw is your Master.<br>
The King who sits on the throne forever is also your friend.<br>
Also, read and study all of the Book of Proverbs, and try your best to obey it.<br>
Thirty-one days in a month, sometimes, and 31 chapters in the Book of Proverbs.<br>
Read one chapter each day for 31 days, and wisdom will stream into you.<br>

Commentary: Just because you have wisdom and knowledge does not mean that the other person wishes to receive it.  Some people are stupid, and they do not want to learn, or grow, or improve, or make any changes or improvements. Those people, the mockers and the wicked, they are stupid, and they are determined to stay stuck on stupid. They want to be stupid and stay stuck on stupid. Do not try to teach or correct stupid people that do not want to learn or make any changes. In many cases, you may have to just shut up, walk away, and stay away. At least you can keep on praying for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 9: 7-12 -- NLT<br>
7<br>
Anyone who rebukes a mocker will get an insult in return.<br>
Anyone who corrects the wicked will get hurt.<br>
8<br>
So don't bother correcting mockers;<br>
they will only hate you.<br>
But correct the wise,<br>
and they will love you.<br>
9<br>
Instruct the wise,<br>
and they will be even wiser.<br>
Teach the righteous,<br>
and they will learn even more.<br>
10<br>
Fear of the Lord is the foundation of wisdom.<br>
Knowledge of the Holy One results in good judgement.<br>
11<br>
Wisdom will multiply your days<br>
and add years to your life.<br>
12<br>
If you become wise, you will be the one to benefit.<br>
If you scorn wisdom, you will be the one to suffer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 23:9 (NLT)<br>
Don't waste your breath on fools, for they will despise the wisest advice.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 26:4 (NLT)<br>
Don't answer the foolish arguments of fools, or you will become as foolish as they are.<br>
<br>
(Proverbs) 28:4 (TS2009)<br>
Those who forsake the Torah praise the wrong, Those who guard the Torah strive with them.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:4 (NLT)<br>
To reject the law is to praise the wicked; to obey the law is to fight them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 20:24 (NLT)<br>
The LORD directs our steps, so why try to understand everything along the way?<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:26 (NLT)<br>
Those who trust their own insight are foolish, but anyone who walks in wisdom is safe.<br>

Here are some words from King David's son, who ruled in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 9: 9-12 -- KJV<br>
(See the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity,)<br>
(Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity,)<br>
9:9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.<br>
9:10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.<br>
9:11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.<br>
9:12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 9: 9-12 -- NLT<br>
9 Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil.<br>
10 Whatever you do, do well. (For when you go to Sheol,) For when you go to the grave, there will be no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom.<br>
11 I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn't always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn't always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skilful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don't always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time.<br>
12 People can never predict when hard times might come. Like fish in a net or birds in a trap, people are caught by sudden tragedy.<br>
