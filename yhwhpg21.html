Saying It Without Saying It<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 1: 1-20 KJV<br>
1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim–zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:<br>
2 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.<br>
<br>
(And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh.)<br>
3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.<br>
<br>
<br>
4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:<br>
<br>
<br>
5 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion (a double portion); for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her womb.<br>
<br>
(And her adversary also angered her sore,)<br>
6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the Lord had shut up her womb.<br>
<br>
<br>
(And as he did so year by year, from the time that she went up to the house of the Lord, from her going up to the house of the Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.)<br>
7 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.<br>
<br>
<br>
8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?<br>
9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord.<br>
<br>
(And she was bitter of soul,)<br>
10 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore.<br>
<br>
<br>
11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid,<br>
(but wilt give unto thine handmaid seed of men, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life,)<br>
but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.<br>
<br>
<br>
12 And it came to pass, (as she multiplied to pray before the Lord,) as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli marked her mouth.<br>
<br>
<br>
13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.<br>
14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, (I am a woman hard of spirit,) I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for (out of the abundance of my meditation) out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.<br>
<br>
<br>
17 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.<br>
18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.<br>
19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.<br>
<br>
<br>
20 Wherefore it came to pass, when (in revolution of days) the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son,<br>
(and called his name, Asked of God, saying, Because I have asked him of the Lord.)<br>
(Samuel means, Asked of God)<br>
and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 1: 1-22 NLT<br>
1 There was a man named Elkanah who lived in Ramah (in Ramathaim-zophim) in the region of Zuph in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, of Ephraim.<br>
<br>
2 Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not.<br>
3 Each year Elkanah would travel to Shiloh to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of Heaven's Armies at the Tabernacle. The priests of the Lord at that time were the two sons of Eli -- Hophni and Phinehas.<br>
4 On the days Elkanah presented his sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to Peninnah and each of her children.<br>
<br>
(And because he loved Hannah, he would give her a choice portion. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.)<br>
5 And though he loved Hannah, he would give her only one choice portion because the Lord had given her no children.<br>
<br>
6 So Peninnah would taunt Hannah and make fun of her because the Lord had kept her from having children.<br>
<br>
<br>
7 Year after year it was the same -- Peninnah would taunt Hannah as they went to the Tabernacle (the house of the Lord). Each time, Hannah would be reduced to tears and would not even eat.<br>
<br>
<br>
8 "Why are you crying, Hannah?" Elkanah would ask. "Why aren't you eating? Why be downhearted just because you have no children? You have me -- isn't that better than having ten sons?"<br>
<br>
<br>
9 Once after a sacrificial meal at Shiloh, Hannah got up and went to pray. Eli the priest was sitting at his customary place beside the entrance of the Tabernacle.<br>
(beside the entrance of the Temple of the Lord.)<br>
<br>
10 Hannah was in deep anguish, crying bitterly as she prayed to the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
11 And she made this vow: "O Lord of Heaven's Armies, if you will look upon my sorrow and answer my prayer and give me a son, then I will give him back to you. He will be yours for his entire lifetime, and as a sign that he has been dedicated to the Lord, his hair will never be cut."<br>
(He will drink neither wine nor intoxicants.)<br>
<br>
12 As she was praying to the Lord, Eli watched her.<br>
13 Seeing her lips moving but hearing no sound, he thought she had been drinking.<br>
14 "Must you come here drunk?" he demanded. "Throw away your wine!"<br>
15 "Oh no, sir!" she replied. "I haven't been drinking wine or anything stronger. But I am very discouraged, and I was pouring out my heart to the Lord.<br>
16 Don't think I am a wicked woman! For I have been praying out of great anguish and sorrow."<br>
17 "In that case," Eli said, "go in peace! May the God of Israel grant the request you have asked of him."<br>
18 "Oh, thank you, sir!" she exclaimed. Then she went back and began to eat again, and she was no longer sad.<br>
19 The entire family got up early the next morning and went to worship the Lord once more. Then they returned home to Ramah. When Elkanah slept with Hannah, the Lord remembered her plea,<br>
<br>
<br>
20 and in due time she gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, for she said, "I asked the Lord for him."<br>
(The name, Samuel, sounds like the Hebrew term for "asked of God" or "heard by God.")<br>
21 The next year Elkanah and his family went on their annual trip to offer a sacrifice to the Lord and to keep his vow.<br>
22 But Hannah did not go. She told her husband, "Wait until the boy is weaned. Then I will take him to the Tabernacle and leave him there with the Lord permanently."<br>
(I will offer him as a Nazirite for all time.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  We have had a few Bible studies in the past when we talked about the benefits of praying and fasting, which included the story where Jesus (pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw, in Hebrew) told his disciples that the reason why they could not cast out that demon was because, that particular kind of demon cannot be cast out except through prayer and fasting, as if fasting whilst praying gives your prayers some kind of extra strong power and authority.  It sounds like that is very true, and maybe we should keep that in mind.  When we did our study on prayer and fasting, we searched and found just about all of the many examples throughout the scriptures when people did praying and fasting.  Did you notice that we just read another story about prayer and fasting?  The word, Fasting, is not in the story, but the story we just read clearly told us that she had stopped eating, and after her prayer, she felt better and was able to eat again.<br>
A typical Bible search engine may not have mentioned this story in the search results, because the actual word, Fasting, is not in the story.<br>
<br>
This is why it is always good to read your Bible and pray, every single day. Read through all 66 of the books in your Bible, all of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament, even if you only read a page a day.  When you do, you will see and discover things that may not be easily detected, like this story here.  Many people might fly right over this story and may not even notice or appreciate that this is yet another example of one who did prayer whilst fasting.<br>

Candles<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 25:31-40 (KJV)<br>
31 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.<br>
32 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:<br>
33 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.<br>
34 And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers.<br>
35 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.<br>
36 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.<br>
<br>
(And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall cause to ascend the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against the face of it.)<br>
<br>
37 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.<br>
38 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.<br>
39 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.<br>
<br>
40 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 25:31-40 (NLT)<br>
31 "Make a lamp-stand of pure, hammered gold. Make the entire lamp-stand and its decorations of one piece -- the base, centre stem, lamp cups, buds, and petals.<br>
32 Make it with six branches going out from the centre stem, three on each side.<br>
33 Each of the six branches will have three lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals.<br>
34 Craft the centre stem of the lamp-stand with four lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals.<br>
35 There will also be an almond bud beneath each pair of branches where the six branches extend from the centre stem.<br>
36 The almond buds and branches must all be of one piece with the centre stem, and they must be hammered from pure gold.<br>
37 Then make the seven lamps for the lamp-stand, and set them so they reflect their light forward.<br>
38 The lamp snuffers and trays must also be made of pure gold.<br>
39 You will need 75 pounds of pure gold for the lamp-stand and its accessories.<br>
(75 pounds of pure gold, in the Hebrew, was, 1 talent, or, 34 kilograms of pure gold.)<br>
<br>
40 "Be sure that you make everything according to the pattern I have shown you here on the mountain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 27: 20 & 21 (KJV)<br>
20 And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light,<br>
(to cause the lamp to ascend up always.)<br>
to cause the lamp to burn always.<br>
21 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the veil, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the Lord: it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 27: 20 & 21 (NLT)<br>
20 "Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.<br>
21 The lamp-stand will stand in the Tabernacle, in front of the inner curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant.<br>
(in the Tent of Meeting, outside the inner curtain that is in front of the Testimony.)<br>
Aaron and his sons must keep the lamps burning in the Lord's presence all night. This is a permanent law for the people of Israel, and it must be observed from generation to generation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 30:7-9 (KJV)<br>
7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense (incense of spices) every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.<br>
<br>
(And when Aaron setteth up the lamps, when Aaron causeth to ascend the lamps, between the two evenings, he shall burn incense upon it,)<br>
8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations.<br>
<br>
9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 30:7-9 (NLT)<br>
7 "Every morning when Aaron maintains the lamps, he must burn fragrant incense on the altar.<br>
8 And each evening when he lights the lamps, he must again burn incense in the Lord's presence. This must be done from generation to generation.<br>
9 Do not offer any unholy incense on this altar, or any burnt offerings, grain offerings, or liquid offerings.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 37:17-24 (KJV)<br>
17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:<br>
18 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:<br>
19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.<br>
20 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:<br>
21 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.<br>
22 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.<br>
23 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold.<br>
24 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 37:17-24 (NLT)<br>
17 Then Bezalel made the lamp-stand of pure, hammered gold. He made the entire lamp-stand and its decorations of one piece -- the base, centre stem, lamp cups, buds, and petals.<br>
18 The lamp-stand had six branches going out from the centre stem, three on each side.<br>
19 Each of the six branches had three lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals.<br>
20 The centre stem of the lamp-stand was crafted with four lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals.<br>
21 There was an almond bud beneath each pair of branches where the six branches extended from the centre stem, all made of one piece.<br>
22 The almond buds and branches were all of one piece with the centre stem, and they were hammered from pure gold.<br>
23 He also made seven lamps for the lamp-stand, lamp snuffers, and trays, all of pure gold.<br>
<br>
(The entire lamp-stand, along with its accessories, was made from 1 talent, or, 34 kilograms of pure gold.)<br>
24 The entire lamp-stand, along with its accessories, was made from 75 pounds of pure gold.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Tabernacle was finished, and Moses Inspects the Work...<br>
The list of the entire Tabernacle, included...<br>
Exodus 39:37 (KJV)<br>
The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,<br>
<br>
Exodus 39:37 (NLT)<br>
the pure gold lamp-stand with its symmetrical lamp cups, all its accessories, and the olive oil for lighting;<br>
<br>
<br>
The Tabernacle is Completed and set up for the first time, on the first day of the new year, (which was sometime in March or April)...<br>
<br>
Exodus 40: 16, 17, then verses 24 & 25 (KJV)<br>
16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded him, so did he.<br>
17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.<br>
24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.<br>
25 And he lighted the lamps before the Lord; as the Lord commanded Moses.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 40: 16, 17, 24 & 25 (NLT)<br>
16 Moses proceeded to do everything just as the Lord had commanded him.<br>
17 So the Tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month of the second year.<br>
24 He set the lamp-stand in the Tabernacle across from the table on the south side of the Holy Place.<br>
25 Then he lit the lamps in the Lord's presence, just as the Lord had commanded him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 8: 1-4 (KJV)<br>
1 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
2 Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.<br>
3 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the Lord commanded Moses.<br>
4 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the pattern which the Lord had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 8: 1-4 (NLT)<br>
1 The Lord said to Moses,<br>
2 "Give Aaron the following instructions: When you set up the seven lamps in the lampstand, place them so their light shines forward in front of the lampstand."<br>
3 So Aaron did this. He set up the seven lamps so they reflected their light forward, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.<br>
4 The entire lampstand, from its base to its decorative blossoms, was made of beaten gold. It was built according to the exact design the Lord had shown Moses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 24:1-4 (KJV)<br>
1 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
<br>
2 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light,<br>
(to cause to ascend continually.)<br>
to cause the lamps to burn continually.<br>
<br>
3 Without the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the Lord continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.<br>
4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the Lord continually.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 24:1-4 (NLT)<br>
1 The Lord said to Moses,<br>
2 "Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.<br>
3 This is the lampstand that stands in the Tabernacle, in front of the inner curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant.<br>
(in the Tent of Meeting, outside the inner curtain of the Testimony)<br>
<br>
Aaron must keep the lamps burning in the Lord's presence all night. This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation.<br>
4 Aaron and the priests must tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand continually in the Lord's presence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 3: 1-8 KJV<br>
1 And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. And the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision.<br>
2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;<br>
3 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;<br>
4 That the Lord called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.<br>
5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.<br>
6 And the Lord called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.<br>
<br>
(Thus did Samuel before he knew the Lord, and before the word of the Lord was revealed unto him.)<br>
7 Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him.<br>
8 And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 3: 1-8 NLT<br>
<br>
1 Meanwhile, the boy Samuel served the Lord by assisting Eli. Now in those days messages from the Lord were very rare, and visions were quite uncommon.<br>
2 One night Eli, who was almost blind by now, had gone to bed.<br>
<br>
(The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was sleeping in the Temple of the Lord, near the Ark of God.)<br>
3 The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was sleeping in the Tabernacle near the Ark of God.<br>
4 Suddenly the Lord called out, "Samuel!"<br>
"Yes?" Samuel replied. "What is it?"<br>
5 He got up and ran to Eli. "Here I am. Did you call me?"<br>
"I didn't call you," Eli replied. "Go back to bed." So he did.<br>
6 Then the Lord called out again, "Samuel!"<br>
Again Samuel got up and went to Eli. "Here I am. Did you call me?"<br>
"I didn't call you, my son," Eli said. "Go back to bed."<br>
7 Samuel did not yet know the Lord because he had never had a message from the Lord before.<br>
8 So the Lord called a third time, and once more Samuel got up and went to Eli. "Here I am. Did you call me?"<br>
Then Eli realized it was the Lord who was calling the boy.<br>
<br>
After that, The Lord Speaks to Samuel,<br>
Samuel Speaks for the Lord to Eli and gives<br>
A Final Warning about Eli's Family and his two Wicked Sons,<br>
And then later, in chapters 3 and 4, it comes true as Eli and his two sons all die on the same day, and The Philistines Capture the Ark.<br>
<br>

Commentary:  There are some other books that used to be in the Bible, that are not in our Bible any more.  Several of them may be good, and valuable, and may still be in a good enough condition to be trustworthy and may have kept their quality and precision when translated into English.  Since this is a Bible study, we mainly limit our studies to just the 66 books that are still left in the Holy Bible that we have today.<br>
<br>
From these other books come some of the additional traditions, rituals and other customs found in the Jewish religion and in the land of Israel.  This is why, some have a tradition of lighting two candles on Friday night, to start the Sabbath.<br>
Another Jewish book not in the Bible can be where most of those doing the Jewish religion get the idea of lighting nine candles.<br>
The Bible does not mention nine candles, and it does not mention eight or two candles. It only mentions seven candles on a candle holder or lamp stand.<br>
<br>
Additionally, in the Jewish religion, people refer to their candelabra using the Hebrew word, menorah.<br>
<br>
Think about gold that is beaten. -- The menorah is made out of beaten gold. -- Beaten gold is more shiny and reflective and sparkly.<br>
Light is more reflective in beaten gold, than in gold that is not beaten.<br>
If we are to be lights of the world, reflecting the light of the world, Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
maybe those who have been beaten in life, and have taken a beating from life, learn how to shine His light in a stronger, more sparkly way, like beaten gold,<br>
than those that did not have such a hard life.  He can use the parts of your life where you took a beating, to make you shine his light more, like beaten gold.<br>
<br>
We just read how the Bible described the menorah, the lamp stand that was built and placed in the tabernacle.<br>
The Bible does not tell us how tall it was. It was made out of 75 pounds of gold.  We can therefore imagine something perhaps at least four or five feet tall.<br>
<br>
The menorahs that people like to commonly buy today are available for sale as tall candle holders that are about that tall.  Most people like to use a smaller version, like something that you can carry around in your hand, or something small and short that can sit on a table or desk.<br>
<br>
The Biblical menorah, that we just studied, holds exactly seven candles, not two, not eight, not nine, but seven, and only seven.<br>
<br>
<br>
The number seven is seen many times throughout the Bible.<br>
<br>
Seven often symbolises completion or perfection.<br>
<br>
Here are only three examples of a list with seven items listed.<br>
<br>
If you also find it enjoyable to light seven candles, here are seven things<br>
to think about as you light the seven candles...<br>
<br>
The Sevenfold spirit of Yaw-Who-Wah, or, the seven spirits of Yaw-Who-Wah<br>
Isaiah 11:2 KJV<br>
verse 2, And the <br>
1. spirit of the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah shall rest upon him,<br>
2. the spirit of wisdom<br>
3. and understanding,<br>
4. the spirit of counsel<br>
5. and might,<br>
6. the spirit of knowledge<br>
7. and of the fear of the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah;<br>
<br>
<br>
Seven things Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, Receives...<br>
Revelation 5:12 KJV<br>
verse 12, Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive<br>
1. power,<br>
2. and riches,<br>
3. and wisdom,<br>
4. and strength,<br>
5. and honour, (or, respect)<br>
6. and glory, (or, esteem)<br>
7. and blessing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And a third example,<br>
Seven praises to God...<br>
Revelation 7:12<br>
...the angels stood round about the throne,...<br>
and worshipped God,<br>
Saying, Amen:<br>
1. Blessing,<br>
2. and glory,<br>
3. and wisdom,<br>
4. and thanksgiving,<br>
5. and honour,<br>
6. and power,<br>
7. and might,<br>
be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
That last item, item number 7,<br>
the KJV says, and might, and the NLT, says, and strength,<br>
be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and there are many, many other examples of things involving the number seven.<br>
Just in this book of Revelation, a few other examples, just in<br>
this book alone, in Revelation, we find seven angels, seven churches,<br>
seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials, seven horns,<br>
seven candlesticks, seven stars, seven plagues, seven spirits,<br>
seven eyes, seven lamps, seven thunders, seven heads, seven crowns,<br>
seven mountains, and seven kings.<br>
<br>
<br>
The word, menorah, is the Hebrew word that gets translated into the English word, lampstand, in the King James Version (KJV).<br>
<br>
<br>
Zechariah 4:2 (KJV)<br>
And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick (the Hebrew word here, is, menorah) all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:<br>
<br>
<br>
Zechariah 4:11 (KJV)<br>
Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?<br>
Again, we have here the word, menorah, which was translated into the English word, candlestick.<br>
<br>
Revelation 11:4 (KJV)<br>
These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.<br>
Where it says, candlesticks, that was a Greek word.<br>
In the ancient Greek, it would have been pronounced, Look-Dee-Uh.<br>
In Greek today, it is now pronounced, EEk-Knee-Ah,<br>
which means, lamp-stand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 25:<br>
verse 31 -- menorah, is where we see the word, candlestick<br>
verse 32 -- menorah, candlestick<br>
verse 33 -- menorah, candlestick<br>
verse 34 -- menorah, candlestick<br>
verse 35 -- menorah, candlestick<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word, menorah, is here in Exodus 25, verses 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35.<br>
Exodus 25 is what we first started reading in this study, that describes the design of the candlestick.<br>
<br>
Since the Hebrew word, menorah, is still commonly used today,<br>
Here are some dictionary definitions of menorah...<br>
<br>
The Chambers Dictionary, I believe has the best and most accurate definition of, menorah...<br>
a candelabrum with seven branches used in Jewish worship and regarded as a symbol of Judaism.<br>
<br>
Longman Dictionary says that a menorah is<br>
a Jewish candlestick that holds seven or nine candles<br>
<br>
Cambridge Dictionary<br>
in the Jewish religion, an object that holds seven or nine candles, used in religious celebrations<br>
<br>
Collins Dictionary (this dictionary has the least-accurate definition)<br>
A menorah is a candelabra consisting of seven or sometimes eight branches. It is a symbol of Judaism.<br>
<br>
Oxford Dictionary<br>
a traditional Jewish object to hold seven or nine candles<br>
<br>
As we now bring this Bible study to a close, I wanted to point out to you one last thing.<br>
The Bible indicates that this lamp-stand candelabrum placed in the tabernacle was to be lit and kept lit all days, all hours.<br>
Leviticus 24 commanded them to keep it lit and burning continually, which is all day and all night.<br>
By the time we get the book of 1 Samuel 3, we see that it is now the custom to let it go out at night.<br>
The commandment was given in Leviticus 24, and by the time we get to 1 Samuel 3, the commandment is disobeyed and no one notices that or cares about that commandment being disobeyed.<br>
That's why no one would hear the voice of the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, in those days, because no one was paying any serious, diligent attention to Torah, studying and obeying the commandments in the Bible.<br>
Did you notice that?  That is why we were studying those verses earlier, out of 1 Samuel 3.<br>
Eli and is two sons were supposed to be running the temple according to the commandments in Torah, in the Bible.<br>
Eli had become fat, selfish and lazy, and did not care about how wicked his two sons had become,<br>
and that is why lazy Eli and his two wicked sons all died on the same day.<br>
Don't let laziness, selfishness and wickedness gradually sneak in and creep in to your life.<br>
Ready and study and obey and do what the Bible is commanding us to do.  Read your Bible, and do the Bible.<br>
Read your entire Bible and pray, every single day. How can you obey, follow, keep, guard and do the Bible, if you're not reading it and studying it?<br>
<br>
Dear Lord Jesus,<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, help us walk in obedience according to your Torah, according to your word and according to your will.<br>
Help us obey, keep, guard and do the Sabbaths and the seven feasts that you command us to do.<br>
Enter into us, wash us, clean us, heal us, remodel us, do a healing, demolition work within us and cast-out all that does not belong, and create in us what is lacking or missing.<br>
Give us now your mercy, your grace, your healing, your power and might, and your Spirit that is Holy, your Roo-Awk Hawk-Oh-Desh,<br>
We thankfully receive your forgiveness, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main. In Jesus' name, Amen.<br>

Old Covenant, New Covenant<br>

<br>
This study does contain some explicit, adult descriptions that may not be suitable for young children.<br>
Non-Christian audiences may be offended.<br>
We will also be quoting some verses from these two sources,<br>
The Scriptures 2009 translation (TS2009) (1993, 2009, 2015)<br>
Geneva Bible translation (GNV) (1560)<br>
along with the usual,<br>
King James Version (KJV) (1611),<br>
New Living Translation (NLT) 5th Edition (2015)<br>
and a little from the New International Version (NIV) (1978, 1984, 2011).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a traditional concept of when two parties would cut a covenant.<br>
This is the ancient, traditional way how two people would make a promise to each other, or an agreement, or a contract.<br>
They would take an animal, like, let's say for example, a calf.<br>
They butcher it into two halves, and then make a little walkway between the two halves.<br>
Next, they walk between the halves, from one end to the other, and exchange the terms of the contract or agreement or promise.<br>
What this means is, if you don't keep the terms of this contract, may you then be cut up into pieces like this animal right here.<br>
Likewise, if I don't keep the terms of this contract, may you then cut me up into pieces like this animal right here.<br>
Then, after both agree to this covenant, they sign the contract and make it an officially done deal, by roasting the animal in fire,<br>
then they basically have a sort of big barbeque, celebrating the contract as being done, signed, and agreed upon.<br>
<br>
The details of this traditional concept, as described here, can be seen in the following Bible story...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 34:8-21 -- KJV<br>
34:8 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;<br>
34:9 That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.<br>
34:10 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.<br>
34:11 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.<br>
34:12 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,<br>
34:13 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,<br>
(At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath sold himself;)<br>
34:14 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.<br>
<br>
(And ye were today turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house whereupon my name is called:)<br>
34:15 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:<br>
<br>
34:16 But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.<br>
<br>
34:17 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine;<br>
(and I will make you for a removing into all the kingdoms of the earth.)<br>
and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.<br>
<br>
34:18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof.<br>
34:19 The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;<br>
34:20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.<br>
34:21 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 34:8-22 -- NLT<br>
8 This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah made a covenant with the people, proclaiming freedom for the slaves.<br>
9 He had ordered all the people to free their Hebrew slaves -- both men and women. No one was to keep a fellow Judean in bondage.<br>
10 The officials and all the people had obeyed the king's command,<br>
11 but later they changed their minds. They took back the men and women they had freed, forcing them to be slaves again.<br>
12 So the Lord gave them this message through Jeremiah:<br>
13 "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors long ago when I rescued them from their slavery in Egypt.<br>
14 I told them that every Hebrew slave must be freed after serving six years. But your ancestors paid no attention to me.<br>
15 Recently you repented and did what was right, following my command. You freed your slaves and made a solemn covenant with me in the Temple that bears my name.<br>
16 But now you have shrugged off your oath and defiled my name by taking back the men and women you had freed, forcing them to be slaves once again.<br>
17 "Therefore, this is what the Lord says: Since you have not obeyed me by setting your countrymen free, I will set you free to be destroyed by war, disease, and famine. You will be an object of horror to all the nations of the earth.<br>
18 Because you have broken the terms of our covenant, I will cut you apart just as you cut apart the calf when you walked between its halves to solemnise your vows.<br>
19 Yes, I will cut you apart, whether you are officials of Judah or Jerusalem, court officials, priests, or common people -- for you have broken your oath.<br>
20 I will give you to your enemies, and they will kill you. Your bodies will be food for the vultures and wild animals.<br>
21 "I will hand over King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials to the army of the king of Babylon. And although they have left Jerusalem for a while,<br>
22 I will call the Babylonian armies back again. They will fight against this city and will capture it and burn it down. I will see to it that all the towns of Judah are destroyed, with no one living there."<br>
<br>

Before we look at the Old Covenant, look at this mention of birds, here in the New Testament...<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 13: 31 & 32 (KJV)<br>
31 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:<br>
32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 13: 31 & 32 (NLT)<br>
31 Here is another illustration Jesus used: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed planted in a field.<br>
32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but it becomes the largest of garden plants; it grows into a tree, and birds come and make nests in its branches."<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4: 30-34 (KJV)<br>
30 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?<br>
31 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:<br>
32 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.<br>
33 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.<br>
34 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4: 30-34 (NLT)<br>
30 Jesus said, "How can I describe the Kingdom of God? What story should I use to illustrate it?<br>
31 It is like a mustard seed planted in the ground. It is the smallest of all seeds,<br>
32 but it becomes the largest of all garden plants; it grows long branches, and birds can make nests in its shade."<br>
33 Jesus used many similar stories and illustrations to teach the people as much as they could understand.<br>
34 In fact, in his public ministry he never taught without using parables; but afterward, when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the Old Covenant...<br>
<br>
A certain type of bird is also mentioned in this story.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 15: 5-18 KJV<br>
<br>
5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.<br>
6 And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.<br>
7 And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to inherit it.<br>
8 And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?<br>
9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.<br>
10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.<br>
11 And when the fowls (birds of prey, swoopers) came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.<br>
12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.<br>
13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;<br>
14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.<br>
15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.<br>
16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.<br>
<br>
17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, (and a lamp of fire) and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.<br>
<br>
18 In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 15: 5-18 NLT<br>
<br>
5 Then the Lord took Abram outside and said to him, "Look up into the sky and count the stars if you can. That's how many descendants you will have!"<br>
6 And Abram believed the Lord, and the Lord counted him as righteous because of his faith.<br>
7 Then the Lord told him, "I am the Lord who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land as your possession."<br>
8 But Abram replied, "O Sovereign Lord, how can I be sure that I will actually possess it?"<br>
9 The Lord told him, "Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."<br>
10 So Abram presented all these to him and killed them. Then he cut each animal down the middle and laid the halves side by side; he did not, however, cut the birds in half.<br>
11 Some vultures swooped down to eat the carcasses, but Abram chased them away.<br>
12 As the sun was going down, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a terrifying darkness came down over him.<br>
13 Then the Lord said to Abram, "You can be sure that your descendants will be strangers in a foreign land, where they will be oppressed as slaves for 400 years.<br>
14 But I will punish the nation that enslaves them, and in the end they will come away with great wealth.<br>
15 (As for you, you will die in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.)<br>
16 After four generations your descendants will return here to this land, for the sins of the Amorites do not yet warrant their destruction."<br>
17 After the sun went down and darkness fell, Abram saw a smoking firepot and a flaming torch pass between the halves of the carcasses.<br>
18 So the Lord made a covenant with Abram that day and said, "I have given this land to your descendants, all the way from the border of Egypt to the great Euphrates River.<br>
<br>
(In verse 18, in the original Hebrew, the great Euphrates River was known as the river of Egypt, referring either to an eastern branch of the Nile River or to the Brook of Egypt in the Sinai.)<br>

<br>
Commentary:  This Bible study contains two studies rolled into one.  We are looking at an Old Covenant in the Old Testament, and in a moment, we'll also look at a New Covenant in the New Testament.  As we just saw, a covenant is a promise, like an agreement or contract between God and his people.  This is the first and main purpose of this study.<br>
<br>
However, there is another interesting thing to study whilst we're here, and that is why we brought in the story about the mustard seed growing into a tall tree with the birds nesting up in the upper branches.<br>
<br>
It is possible to consider that the birds can be a symbol of evil, of satan, and his followers, trying to mess up and desecrate and ruin was God is doing.  God is making a promise, and evil, unclean birds are trying to defile and desecrate the promise.  The Hebrew word for the birds in the Old Testament covenant, were for Swoopers, the kind of birds that swoop down to catch their prey, like eagles, hawks and vultures, the kind of birds that the Bible describes as being unclean and cannot be eaten because they eat other unclean animals or they eat from dead carcases. The birds that nest in the upper branches in the mustard seed parable, that Greek word is mainly just a general word for birds in general.  What if those birds nesting in the upper branches were sometimes evil as well?<br>
<br>
Recently, people have been making and uploading video recordings of themselves claiming to be victims of satanic ritual abuse.  These videos get uploaded onto YouTube.  YouTube deletes the video, and so the video ends up being uploaded again and then staying on another website, called BitChute. So, if you're after videos about the truth, try YouTube, but then try BitChute for all the videos that YouTube deleted and banned. BitChute was especially created as a place to upload videos that were deleted from YouTube.<br>
<br>
According to these many video recordings on YouTube and BitChute, those that claim to have been victims of static ritual abuse, have said the following things.  We will simply refer to the followers and worshippers of satan, the people that are doing the satanic rituals, simply as satanic people.<br>
<br>
The rituals are grotesque and horrific.  The satanic people will take babies, toddlers and little children, and abuse them, rape and torture them, then murder them, drink their blood and eat their flesh.  They believe that, the more pain and torture is inflicted on the baby or child just before killing it, the more of a special substance in released into the body's bloodstream just before killing the baby or child, and by drinking the blood immediately afterwards, it will result in a higher concentration of the substance that will be in the victim's blood, a substance that they believe makes them feel euphorically high and happy, and keeps them young, like something that would give them eternal life and stop them from ageing.<br>
<br>
Another person said in a video that they take girls in foster care, girls that no one would miss if they go missing, and rape them until they get pregnant, and then, at a certain stage in the pregnancy, they cut out the unborn child and do similar kinds of satanic rituals, or they might keep the girl a prisoner and keep her making babies for satanic rituals and sacrifices. No one knows that the girl is being forced to do this, and no one knows about the babies being born and murdered.<br>
<br>
Several of the people in these videos claim that the secret clubs, secret societies and secret brotherhood organisations, with names like, free &#109;&#97;&#115;&#111;&#110;s, free &#109;&#97;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry, odd fellows, B P O E, elks lodge, moose lodge, &#115;&#104;&#114;&#105;&#110;ers, the Elite, the Ill&#117;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#97;&#116;&#105;, and other such secret brotherhoods, are all satanic, filled with satanic people, doing the satanic rituals as described a moment ago.  One person said that, these satanic people love to sit in a Christian church service on Sunday, so that no one will suspect that they are satanic people.<br>
<br>
A few others have claimed that satanic people are running Christian churches, especially the financially successful large-sized churches, known as Mega-churches.  One woman said that the church her family attended would go to a Sunday Christian church, the ordinary, boring kind of Sunday church services, but the entire church was just a disguise and was actually filled with satanic people doing satanic rituals as described earlier.  Who would suspect that the boring Christian church nearby was actually a place for doing satanic rituals, filled with satanic people, sexually abusing children in their rituals, and the other bad things described earlier?<br>
<br>
If satanic people are running large corporations like Google, which owns YouTube, then, it's no wonder that YouTube likes to delete videos that talk about satanic people. Those videos might be talking about the same satanic people that own and run YouTube and Google!<br>
<br>
One last example of things that people say in these videos, is that the free &#109;&#97;&#115;&#111;&#110;s, the rich elite and the Ill&#117;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#97;&#116;&#105;, and other secret brotherhood associations like those, are all very rich and powerful people, financially, and they are running and/or influencing Mega-churches, Public Schools, Medical Schools, Charter Schools, Colleges, Universities, Drug Companies, as well as large businesses and corporations, and governments.  Many of the politicians and prime ministers and other government leaders, in fact, perhaps just about all of them are all satanic people.  One person said that, all of those in leadership in the Church of England, all of the pastors and priests working for the Church of England, must join or be in the free &#109;&#97;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry secret brotherhood, which therefore would mean that, only satanic people are allowed to work in the Church of England. This means that the Church of England is satanic, filled with satanic people, being ran and operated by satanic people, secretly doing the satanic rituals described earlier.  How many other so-called Christian churches are this way? Were there many Catholic priests being accused of sexually abusing boys? Could this also indicate that perhaps all Catholic priests, maybe even all the way up to the pope himself, could all be satanic people as well?  God knows about all of these secrets, and, someday, He will take all that is wrong, and make it right. Vengeance belongs to the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.  He will pay them back.  There is a Wrath of God, a Wrath of Yaw-Who-Wah, which we have studied, and the Wrath of God will we poured out, undiluted, on a Christ rejecting, sinful world.<br>
<br>
Why did we spend all of this time talking about rich, satanic people influencing and running our Public Schools, Medical Schools, Charter Schools, Colleges, Universities, running the Drug Companies, running our government, running our corporations and businesses, running fake and phoney Christian Mega-churches? Because, that could all be a picture of the birds nesting in the upper branches.  The mustard seed that grows into a big tree, that can be an example of a church that grows into a Mega-church being ran by satanic people high up in the church's leadership, nesting in the upper branches of the church's organisation.  Mustard seeds do not grow into big trees, they only grow into moderately-sized bushes.  The original church as demonstrated in the Bible, in the Book of Acts, only met from house to house.  It never grew a single church building into a Mega-church.  A mustard seed grows into a bush, not a big tree for satanic people to nest in its upper levels of leadership.  If you were to actually read through your entire Bible, you would find out that most churches are disobeying the commandments in the Bible, and when you finally realise this, if the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah tells you to leave your fake Mega-church, leave it and don't look back.  Remember Lot's wife.<br>
<br>
So, what we just did, was, we were thinking about the birds, the unclean birds trying to wreck or defile the covenant that God was doing with Abraham, and we just got done talking about the birds that we saw nesting in the upper branches of the Mustard tree, which is unnaturally large, because mustard seeds are only supposed to make bushes, not big trees.  That's enough talk about satan.  Let's go back to the Bible, and take a look at a second, new covenant.  We saw the covenant that God did with Abraham.  Now, let's look at a new covenant in the New Testament.  Then we'll do a final commentary, comparison and analysis of these two covenants, and then finish this study with a good prayer.<br>
<br>
By the way, the Lord uses everyone for his plan and for his purposes, even those bound for hell, even satanic people. Unclean birds can be used for his purposes.  Unclean birds do have an important purpose in nature, and in the environment and in the food chain relationship with other animals.  The Lord can use birds for good, and the unclean birds can be used for God's purposes.  The Bible does give us an example of unclean birds being used for good, which is something that we studied, when we did the Bible study, titled, Elijah and The God Contest, which was in<br>
Christian Essays 7, the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 7,<br>
During a drought and famine in the land, the Lord said to Elijah,<br>
1 Kings 17:4 (NLT)<br>
Drink from the brook and eat what the ravens bring you, for I have commanded them to bring you food.<br>
<br>
The ravens running the fake churches, they were used by God to serve us the baby food Bible studies that helped us grow and go on our journey to the more advanced Torah studies that we are now doing today.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And now, here is the New Covenant...<br>
We have studied this before, but it is very important, so, let's read it again...<br>
<br>
Matthew 26:26-30 (KJV)<br>
26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.<br>
27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;<br>
28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.<br>
29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.<br>
30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 26:26-30 (NLT)<br>
26 As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it, for this is my body."<br>
27 And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them and said, "Each of you drink from it,<br>
28 for this is my blood, which confirms the covenant (the new covenant) between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many.<br>
29 Mark my words -- I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom."<br>
30 Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 14:22-26 (KJV)<br>
22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.<br>
23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.<br>
24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.<br>
25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.<br>
26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 14:22-26 (NLT)<br>
22 As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take it, for this is my body."<br>
23 And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.<br>
24 And he said to them, "This is my blood, which confirms the covenant (the new covenant) between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice for many.<br>
25 I tell you the truth, I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God."<br>
26 Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11:23-32 KJV<br>
23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:<br>
24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.<br>
25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.<br>
26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<br>
27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.<br>
28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.<br>
29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.<br>
30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.<br>
31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.<br>
32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 11:23-32 NLT<br>
23 For I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread<br>
24 and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and said, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."<br>
25 In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant between God and his people -- an agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it."<br>
26 For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes again.<br>
27 So anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.<br>
28 That is why you should examine yourself before eating the bread and drinking the cup.<br>
29 For if you eat the bread or drink the cup without honouring the body of Christ, you are eating and drinking God's judgement upon yourself.<br>
30 That is why many of you are weak and sick and some have even died.<br>
31 But if we would examine ourselves, we would not be judged by God in this way.<br>
32 Yet when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned along with the world.<br>

Unfortunately, every English Bible translation has its own set of problems, mistakes, and translation errors and inaccuracies.<br>
These mistakes sometimes are accidental misunderstandings,<br>
or maybe they are deliberate, demonic, satanic lies, trying to cause confusion, discord, poisoning and defiling the truth with deliberate lies from satan.<br>
Satanic people, and satanic, false religions, and satanic secret brotherhoods, may try to change, dilute and defile the Bible, by making these mistakes, maybe by accident, or maybe on purpose.<br>
Nevertheless, there is no such thing as a perfect English translation.<br>
You could spend many hours just comparing and studying the many translations and their history.<br>
Although I generally do like to sometimes share from the Eth Cepher and The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009),<br>
in September of 2023, we sadly discovered a series of fatal mistakes in these two English translations.<br>
They both seem to think that the word, New, and the word, Renewed, are the same thing.<br>
Where we should only see the word, New, they have changed it to, Renewed, which is an absolute lie from the pit of hell.<br>
This sad and serious mistake just confirms and verifies that, there is no such thing as a perfect English translation.<br>
Be that as it may, here are some examples where this mistake can be seen in the Eth Cepher and in The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009).<br>
There are more mistakes like this, in these translations, in the old and new Testament, in addition to the ones that we will look at here.<br>
Here are some places where it should say, New,<br>
and the Eth Cepher and The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) changed it to, Renewed.<br>

8:13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.<br>

<br>
Hebrews 8: 6-13 -- NLT<br>
6 But now Jesus, our High Priest, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant with God, based on better promises.<br>
7 If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it.<br>
8<br>
But when God found fault with the people, he said:<br>
"The day is coming, says the Lord,<br>
when I will make a new covenant<br>
with the people of Israel and Judah.<br>
9<br>
This covenant will not be like the one<br>
I made with their ancestors<br>
when I took them by the hand<br>
and led them out of the land of Egypt.<br>
They did not remain faithful to my covenant,<br>
so I turned my back on them, says the Lord.<br>
10<br>
(But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel after those days, says the Lord:)<br>
But this is the new covenant I will make<br>
with the people of Israel on that day, says the Lord:<br>
I will put my laws in their minds,<br>
and I will write them on their hearts.<br>
I will be their God,<br>
and they will be my people.<br>
11<br>
(And they will not need to teach their neighbours, nor will they need to teach their brother,)<br>
And they will not need to teach their neighbours,<br>
nor will they need to teach their relatives,<br>
saying, 'You should know the Lord.'<br>
For everyone, from the least to the greatest,<br>
will know me already.<br>
12<br>
And I will forgive their wickedness,<br>
and I will never again remember their sins."<br>
<br>
(This is a quote from Jeremiah 31: 31-34.)<br>
<br>
13<br>
When God speaks of a "new" covenant, it means he has made the first one obsolete. It is now out of date and will soon disappear.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: A covenant was a promise, an agreement between two parties or two people.  It was like a formal, verbal contract.  The general concept was, they would take an animal, and break its body into two halves, or, rather, butcher or cut the body into two halves, and then they would lay the two halves side by side.  Then the two people representing the two parties involved, would walk in between the two halves and proclaim the details of the contract, promise or agreement.  The idea was, if I don't keep my end of the agreement, then you may do to me what we did to the body of this animal that I am walking next to here.  And the other person would say the same kind of thing, yes, and if I do not keep my promise that I am making here, may you do this to me as well, what we just did here to this body or these bodies of these animals here, kill me and cut me in half or break me in half if I don't keep my promise or covenant.  Then, after they pass through and walk to the opposite end of the broken body cut in half or butchered in half, they would then burn it as a sacrifice.  The burning of it with fire was like signing the contract, it seals the deal. Maybe they would cook or barbecue portions as a way of celebrating that they have made these promises to each other.<br>
<br>
So, to make the covenant, they break a body in two, and then the broken body is passed through fire to complete and activate the agreement.  Now, look at the Old Covenant that God did with Abram.  Since he will later on have his name changed to Abraham, we will call him Abraham, even though that is not the correct way of pronouncing his name in the ancient Hebrew. We'll just stick to the English pronunciation even though it is technically wrong. Both parties are supposed to walk between the halves of the broken body, from one end to the other.  What did Abraham do?  He fell asleep!  This is very important!  Did the Lord God say, I can't keep my promise if you don't do your part, Abraham?  No.  The Lord Yaw-Who-Wah, God did not say that.  Whilst Abraham was asleep, God walked through the halves without Abraham, then he signed the contract by making the broken halves pass through fire.  God made the covenant and then burnt it with fire to sign and activate the covenant. God did it all and Abraham slept right through it.  God does not need Abraham to keep and fulfil God's promises.  God's ability to keep his promises is not dependent on you.  He made his promises to you before you were even born.<br>
<br>
Now let's think about the New Covenant.  Again we take a body and we break it into two halves.  Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw says, this little loaf of bread right here, this is my body, broken for you. He is taking a body, the symbol of the little loaf of bread representing Christ's body, and he is making a new covenant.  Then he uses a cup of wine to represent his blood.  He wants to enter into us and dwell in our hearts and fill us with his spirit, which is why he wants his body, the bread, and his life, the blood, the wine, to enter into us, as he entered into his disciples, as they ate the bread and drank the wine, and then, later, after his resurrection, he breathes his spirit that is holy, into them.<br>
<br>
Wait a second.  If the bread was him making a new covenant, why didn't he burn the bread with fire, like they did with the animals in the covenant that God made with Abraham? Well, technically, how was bread made in those days?  The bread dough has to go through a fiery trial, that is, the bread had to spend some time baking in an oven of fire.  But, instead of being destroyed, the dough becomes a loaf of bread that can sustain life and give life as food to others.  The bread already passed through the fire of an oven when it was baking.<br>
<br>
It's important to note the part about the wine, which was a symbol of Christ's blood, and blood is a symbol of the life that is in someone.  The old testament tells us that the life of the body is in the blood.  So, in a symbolic way, Jesus is saying, I want to take my life and pass it into you, so that you may live.  That's why he says, to drink ye all of it.  He tells them to drink all of the wine, a symbol of his life.  He wants all of his life to enter into all of your life.  He wants full-time custody, not just weekend visits. Love all of the Lord with all of your heart, mind, soul and strength.  The way how you can do that is to let all of him enter into all of you.  Drink ye all of it, for this is the New Covenant which was done so that our sins can go into remission and be forgiven and forgotten.<br>
<br>
Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw said that the bread and the wine were symbols of his body and his blood, but was his body and his blood actually used to make a New Covenant?  Yes.  After this last supper, his body was beaten and broken, and yet none of his bones were broken, fulfilling prophecy. His blood, his life came out of his body so that his life, his eternal life can enter into us, so that he can dwell in us and fill us with his spirit.  And then, he did pass through the fire to seal the deal, to sign the contract and activate the new covenant, as he passed through the fire, being in the lake of fire for three days, the lake of fire being hell itself. During those three days whilst his body was dead, Jesus was actually in hell during those three days and three nights.  He told us in advance that this is what he was going to do. Jesus' body was broken up, and his blood poured out as a sacrifice, and he was made into a covenant by passing through the fires of hell.  Jesus went to hell for us so that we don't have to. Here are the Bible verses that tell us this...<br>
<br>
<br>
Jesus' body was so terribly broken, and yet, none of his bones were broken.<br>
Yet He was beaten beyond recognition, which means, they beat him so badly, that you could no longer recognise who he was.<br>
He did not even look Human.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 52:14 (KJV)<br>
As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:<br>
<br>
Isaiah 52:14 (NIV)<br>
Just as there were many who were appalled at him -- his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being and his form marred beyond human likeness --<br>
<br>
Isaiah 52:14 (NLT)<br>
But many were amazed when they saw him. His face was so disfigured he seemed hardly human, and from his appearance, one would scarcely know he was a man.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jesus went to hell for three days, and then was raised up to heaven.<br>
Control and power of hell was given over to Jesus, and He's the one who says who can and can't go in to hell.<br>
He proves it by holding the keys to hell in his hand.<br>
<br>
Here is the verse where He tells the disciples in advance that He is going to hell for three days and three nights...<br>
If anyone says that Jesus did not go to hell, then that person is calling Jesus a liar, because Jesus Yaw-Who-Shaw tells us Himself, in advance, before it happens...<br>
<br>
"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:40 (KJV)<br>
For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12:40 (NLT)<br>
For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.<br>
<br>
Yonah is the Hebrew name for 'Jonah.'<br>
Matthew 12:40 (TS2009)<br>
"For as Yonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish, so shall the Son of Ah-Dawm (Son of Adam, Son of Man) be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Van Rensburgs HebrewGospels.com -- Hebrew Gospels from Catalonia, Sepharad (Spain)<br>
A literal translation of a medieval Hebrew manuscript in the Vatican Library.<br>
Translated by Justin J. Van Rensburg<br>
Version 2.2 -- March 2021<br>
<br>
Yonah is the Hebrew name for 'Jonah.'<br>
Matthew 12:40 -- Hebrew New Testament to English Translation<br>
For just like Yonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights,<br>
so will the Son of the virgin be in the heart of the earth, (inside the earth)<br>
three days and three nights.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Jonah was swallowed by a big fish, not a whale.<br>
We have English translations that say, whale, instead of fish, due to the precise meaning of words being lost or degraded in the translation process.<br>
We have talked about this a bit in Christian Essays 12 and we will look at this fish-to-whale translation mistake again in Christian Essays 25.<br>
If the KJV translation team would have had access to the original Hebrew New Testament, instead of that Greek translation that they had, they would have used the word, fish, instead of whale.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:18 (KJV)<br>
I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.<br>
<br>
Revelation 1:18 (NLT)<br>
I am the living one. I died, but look -- I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and the grave.<br>
<br>
Revelation 1: 17 & 18 TS2009<br>
17 And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead, and He placed His right hand on me, saying, "Do not be afraid, I am the First and the Last,<br>
18 and the living One. And I became dead, and see, I am living forever and ever. Amen. And I possess the keys of She'ol and of Death.<br>
<br>
<br>
His soul went to hell but He was not left there.  Here is another verse that tells us that He went to hell, but He was not left there...<br>
<br>
Acts 2: 31-33 KJV<br>
31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.<br>
32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.<br>
33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.<br>
<br>
We quickly consult again our Greek Strongs and other Greek reference books that we have mentioned many times before.<br>
The Greek word for hell, here in Acts 2, verse 31 in the KJV is the Greek word, Hades.<br>
Hades is the place of departed souls, of departed spirits,<br>
the lower regions, the nether world, the realm of the dead, the heart of the earth, the lowest parts of the earth,<br>
the grave, death, hell,<br>
the infernal regions, a dark and dismal place in the very depths of the earth, the common receptacle of disembodied spirits.<br>
Also referred to as Sheol, outer darkness, a lake of fire, a fire so hot that it produces no visible light, like radiation heat.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts of the Apostles 2: 31-33 NLT<br>
31 David was looking into the future and speaking of the Messiah's resurrection. He was saying that God would not leave him among the dead or allow his body to rot in the grave.<br>
32 "God raised Jesus from the dead, and we are all witnesses of this.<br>
33 Now he is exalted to the place of highest honour in heaven, at God's right hand. And the Father, as he had promised, gave him the Holy Spirit to pour out upon us, just as you see and hear today.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Acts) 2: 31-33 TS2009<br>
31 foreseeing this he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Messiah, that His being was neither left in She'ol, nor did His flesh see corruption.<br>
32 "ELL-Low-Heem has raised up this Yaw-Who-Shaw of which we are all witnesses.<br>
33 "Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of ELL-Low-Heem, and having received from the Father the promise of the Set-apart Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4: 9 & 10 TS2009<br>
9 But what does "He went up" mean, except that He also first went down into the lower parts of the earth?<br>
10 He who went down is also the One who went up far above all the heavens, to fill all.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4: 9 & 10 KJV<br>
9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?<br>
10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4: 9 & 10 GNV<br>
9 (Now, in that he ascended, what is it but that he had also descended first into the lowest parts of the earth?<br>
10 He that descended, is even the same that ascended, far above all heavens, that he might fill all things)<br>
<br>
<br>
His body was broken (but His bones were not) and he went through a fiery trial, being in the lake of fire,<br>
and He did that to complete the New Covenant, giving up his life to save our life, so that our sins will go into remission.<br>
He made the New Covenant so that we can do and complete the Old Covenant, completely and perfectly.<br>
You need the Old Covenant and the New Covenant to get into Heaven.  Only one covenant without the other will not get you into heaven.<br>
You need both. One does not work if it does not have the other one. If you have one now, then go and get the other one.<br>
<br>
As we now come the conclusion of this Bible study, let's finish this study with a prayer.  Let us pray.<br>
<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, Dear Yaw ELL-Low-Heem Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, we believe that Jesus is Lord, and that God raised up Jesus from hell to save us from our sins. In Hebrew, we would say that, we believe that Yaw-Who-Shaw is Yaw-Who-Wah, and that Yaw-Who-Wah raised up Yaw-Who-Shaw out of She'ol, Hades, hell, death and the grave.  Enter into us, dwell and live in us, heal and transform us, clean us and remodel us, and fill us with your Holy Spirit, your spirit that is holy, your Hawk-Coh-Desh Roo-Awk, your Roo-Awk Hawk-Coh-Desh.  And now that you have done this, the New Covenant, we now have the strength, power and ability to obey, and keep and guard and do your commandments, your Torah, your Sabbaths and your seven feasts of the Lord. We can now obey Torah, the commandments, the law, because you fill us with your presence, your breath, your spirit and your glory fills this body, this temple. We thankfully receive the New Covenant, which gives us the ability to accept and agree and follow and obey the Old Covenant, which is obeying your Torah, your commandments, which is how we love you back.  You showed your love to us through the New Covenant, and we show our love back to you through the Old covenant.  Together this old and new covenant, of salvation and obedience, causes our sins to be forgiven, giving us eternal life, forgiveness of sins, and a forever home with you in your kingdom of God, the New Jerusalem, the kingdom of heaven, which we get to inherit.  We thank you for all of these promises that you have made and have faithfully kept for us, because you love us with an everlasting love.  Please help us walk the steps through each day, staying on the track, the racetrack. Thank you for helping us not be weary as we run the race with patience.  Give us all that we need.  Help us do your will. We thankfully receive your forgiveness.  Help us stay away from temptations, deceptions and strong delusions.  Help us cling to the true trinity, which is the Father, the Son and the Holy spirit, and help us stay far away from the counterfeit trinity, which is satan, the anti-christ and the false prophet.  Guard our hearts. Deliver us from all evil. Bless us and protect us.  In Jesus' name, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-main, amen. Hallelujah!<br>

Verse Of The Year<br>
<br>
<br>
Before we get started, I just wanted to lookup two verses in the translation, known as,<br>
The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (1993, 2009, 2015)<br>
<br>
(John) 3:16 (TS2009)<br>
"For Elohim so loved the world that He gave His only brought-forth Son, so that everyone who believes in Him should not perish but possess everlasting life.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Romans) 10:9 (TS2009)<br>
That if you confess with your mouth the Master Yaw-Who-Shaw and believe in your heart that Elohim has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.<br>
<br>
<br>
We'll look at a few more verses in the The Scriptures 2009 translation, here, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are many websites where you can go and read the entire Bible online, for free.<br>
The sites also let you search for Bible verses, and can access many other<br>
tools and searching abilities, like the ability to click on a word<br>
and see the word in the Strongs, and other resources,<br>
to learn more about the word, and what it means.<br>
<br>
Some of the many websites that provide the entire Bible online, include<br>
<br>
blueletterbible.org<br>
which is one the first websites, that started in 1996.<br>
<br>
Other websites today, would include, for example,<br>
studybible.info<br>
sacrednamebible.com<br>
biblestudytools.com<br>
biblegateway.com<br>
biblica.com<br>
<br>
What I have found to be my favourite is<br>
Bible.com<br>
<br>
They have the entire Bible online, you can easily search the entire Bible online,<br>
and, like others, Bible.com also has a Bible App you can put on your phone,<br>
so you can quickly read or search the Bible on your phone.<br>
<br>
This online bible website and bible app, at Bible.com,<br>
is ran by a company called, YouVersion.<br>
<br>
YouVersion was first launched in 2008, and is ran from Edmond, Oklahoma.<br>
<br>
In 2020, according to YouVersion, its Bible App features 2,062 Bible versions in 1,372 languages.<br>
<br>
At least since 2012, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. billionaire founder/owner David Green has sponsored the YouVersion Bible app for mobile phones.<br>
<br>
<br>
At the end of each year, YouVersion sends out a press release to reveal what the Bible Verse of the Year was.<br>
In earlier years, it was described as the most popular bible verse of the year, but, since that is not the most accurate description,<br>
it is now known as the YouVersion Bible Verse of the Year.<br>
<br>
The YouVersion Bible Verse of the Year, is the Bible verse that was shared, bookmarked, and highlighted most often by the global YouVersion Community.<br>
<br>
Technically, it can't really be called the most popular Bible verse of the year, because it only takes into account certain actions taken only by users on the YouVersion website and Bible app.<br>
One might say, perhaps a verse like John 3:16 could be most popular, but, since many Christians already know it, and they already remember where it is located, there is no need to go searching for its location, since it is already so popular.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's go back several years, and see what the YouVersion Bible Verse of the Year was for each year, starting in 2011.<br>
<br>
On the Parallel Bible page, also known as, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter Zero, we went through a list of the top 500 most popular Bible verses.<br>
(It was actually 523 of the most popular, most searched for Bible verses.)<br>
Although the listed verses were not sorted into any organised order or ranking, but somewhat randomly and poorly shuffled into place, all of these YouVersion Bible Verses of the Year<br>
all landed within the the first 150 Bible verses listed.<br>
<br>
<br>
As we now look at the YouVersion Bible Verse of the Year, for each year, starting in 2011, we will also note the number<br>
where the verse landed in our random list of the top 500 Bible verses, over on the<br>
Parallel Bible page, also known as, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter Zero.<br>
Again, they all landed within the first 150 positions of that somewhat-random list.<br>
Our first YouVersion Bible Verse of the Year, in the year 2011, landed in our list at random position number 32.<br>
That same verse was also the YouVersion Bible Verse of the Year for 2012.<br>

Remember, when we did the study, titled, Rod, back in Christian Essays 6, we saw this...<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24:6 KJV and<br>
Proverbs 11:14 KJV<br>
(in the)...multitude of counsellors there is safety.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
That concept is also true when we have a multitude of Bible translations.<br>
When you are examining a Bible verse, one interesting thing to do, is to compare the verse by reading it in several trustworthy English translations.<br>
<br>
When you look at the same Bible verse in several good English translations, you will start to see two interesting things.<br>
1. The actual, in-depth meaning of the original language can be revealed as each translation team tries to give us an English understanding.<br>
2. When one translation team says something, and the other teams do not duplicate or at least somewhat agree with it, there is a good chance that the one team may have made a mistake, or have had a moment of precision degradation.  Newer transcript copies of scripture, made manually by a human writing it all out by hand with ink, may have made a mistake, or tried to fix something that was not broken, or were influenced by religious or political agendas when they hand wrote their copy of their translation.<br>
<br>
<br>
If everyone had a perfect copy of the most original original books, and everyone had perfect language understanding and perfect, un-biased translation standards, then we would have perfectly clear and correct English translations, each of them being in perfect agreement in their meanings and choice of words.<br>
<br>
But, as we know all too well, humans are not perfect. They have all sinned and have fallen short of the glory of God, and are in desperate need of a saviour to rescue them from sin, hell and death. So, in summary, if one translation seems to be not quite in agreement with several of the other translations, that sometimes might indicate that the one translation team might have had a slight lack of quality and accuracy in their translation efforts at that moment when they were working on that verse.<br>
<br>
Defective or imperfect human translators, reading defective or imperfect copies of ancient books, will produce defective or imperfect translations. All English translations are imperfect in one way or another, and that is why, if you want a safe and sure understanding, in the reading and consulting of a multitude of translations, there is safety.<br>
<br>
I like how the NLT, and now the NASB both decided to be honest about this, and they both decided to correct their mistakes and release revised editions, which is why we have a fifth edition of the NLT, and now a 7th Edition of the NASB, known as the NASB 2020 translation.<br>
<br>
Here is an example of this concept...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41:10 (NASB1995)<br>
Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you, Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Notice the word, "surely" in the NASB 1995 edition?<br>
The other translations do not have this word, surely.<br>
<br>
The little mistakes in the NASB 1995 edition were corrected and fixed in the 2020 edition.<br>
The New American Standard Bible (NASB) has a newer, 5th Edition that came out in 2020, and we will see here, in just a moment, how they fixed the verse, and removed the word, surely.<br>
We also saw, earlier, in the KJV, that they were adding the word, yea, to the verse.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's read this verse again, and compare it with the newer 2020 edition.<br>
Isaiah 41:10 (NASB1995)<br>
Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you, Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41:10 (NASB2020)<br>
'Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, I will also help you, I will also uphold you with My righteous right hand.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41:10 (NLT)<br>
Don't be afraid, for I am with you. Don't be discouraged, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To get a better idea about what is going on here, in Isaiah 41, before and after verse 10, we will zoom out and take a look at<br>
Isaiah 41, verses 8 through 13, when we do the Bible study, titled,<br>
"Confounded"<br>
which is a study that we will do when we get to<br>
Christian Essays 28,<br>
which is, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 28.<br>
<br>
<br>
Before we go, let's spend a few more minutes here, and take a closer look at this Isaiah 41:10 Bible Verse of the Year.<br>
We now consult again two reference books. The first one is titled,<br>
A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,<br>
which is a book more commonly known as the Brown-Driver-Briggs or BDB, which is based on the name of its three authors.<br>
The BDB is a standard reference for Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, first published in the year 1906.<br>
<br>
We will now use that book again, along with the Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Strong's Concordance, by James Strong, first published in 1890.<br>
<br>
We are finding out what the Hebrew word is right there in that verse, where it says, in the<br>
KJV: be not dismayed;<br>
TS2009: Do not look around,<br>
NASB 1995: Do not anxiously look about you,<br>
NASB 2020: Do not be afraid,<br>
<br>
These translations are all trying to translate the Hebrew word, Cha-Ah, which can mean all of those things.<br>
I find it to be quite disappointing that the NASB 2020 team did away with the unique, insightful perspective that the NASB 1995 team revealed.<br>
That makes me want to stick with the NASB 1995 translation, or at least keep checking both of them; the 1995 and the newer 2020 NASB editions.<br>
The TS2009 and the NASB 1995 both show us something interesting coming from the Hebrew word, Cha-Ah.<br>
The BDB and the Strong's Concordance totally verify and support what the various translations did with that Hebrew word, Cha-Ah.<br>
<br>
Peter forgot about this verse when he tried to walk on water.<br>
If they would have had clocks in those days, this event with Peter would have happened at about three o'clock in the morning.<br>
<br>
Matthew 14:26-32 (NLT)<br>
When the disciples saw (Jesus) walking on the water, they were terrified.<br>
In their fear, they cried out, "It's a ghost!" But Jesus spoke to them at once.<br>
"Don't be afraid," he said.<br>
(I Am! The 'I Am' is here!)<br>
"Take courage. I am here!"<br>
Then Peter called to him, "Lord, if it's really you, tell me to come to you, walking on the water."<br>
"Yes, come," Jesus said. So Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.<br>
But when he saw the strong wind and the waves, he was terrified and began to sink.<br>
"Save me, Lord!" he shouted. Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him.<br>
"You have so little faith," Jesus said. "Why did you doubt me?"<br>
When they climbed back into the boat, the wind stopped.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Peter did a Cha-Ah.<br>
Peter took his eyes off of the great 'I Am' and<br>
looked away, and looked down at the waves, and looked in dismay, he gazed about, in anxiety,<br>
Peter looked around, he anxiously looked about him, and his situation.<br>
Peter basically disobeyed the Isaiah 41:10 Bible verse of the year right in front of Jesus himself, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck, the great I am.<br>
Do you want to stay afloat in your situation and not sink? Don't disobey the Isaiah 41:10 Bible verse of the year.<br>
Do what it says.  He is commanding you not to do those things. Be not dismayed; Do not look around, Do not anxiously look about you, Do not be afraid, do not gaze about in anxiety.<br>
<br>
And, if you obey this verse, look at all of those promises in this verse.<br>
He will be with us, He will strengthen us and help us and fortify us and sustain us and hold us up with his righteous right hand.<br>
You're not going down if He is holding you up. You're not going to sink and drown because He is lifting you up and holding you up with His victorious, righteous right hand.<br>

It sounded like just another nice, secular, popular song back in 1984.<br>
Like other popular, secular songs of that time, it sounded like just another adult contemporary popular song.<br>
The hit music radio stations played it right along with all of the other hits in 1984.<br>
But, most people probably did not even notice that it was singing the actual, sacred, Hebrew name of God.<br>
Most Christians did not even know the Hebrew pronunciation of God's sacred name back in 1984, just the common English name, the Lord.<br>
We know today that the short version of the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah is, Yaw.<br>
It is the Yaw sound at the end of hallelujah.<br>
But did you know, almost 40 years ago, in 1984, this hit song was actually singing about Yaw?<br>
No other so-called Christian song was as popular as this one in 1984.<br>
It was not marketed as a Christian song in 1984, but just another secular hit song, but, if you examine it carefully,<br>
it is giving you good advice, reminding you to call on the Hebrew name of Yaw!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yah Mo B There was a popular song in 1984, by<br>
James Ingram and Michael McDonald<br>
<br>
<br>
James Ingram was born in 1952,<br>
and he died in 2019, at the age of 66.<br>
James Ingram was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and instrumentalist.<br>
He was a two-time Grammy Award-winner and a two-time Academy Award nominee for Best Original Song.<br>
Some of his famous, secular songs included,<br>
a duet with fellow rhythm and blues artist Patti Austin, which was in 1982, "Baby, Come to Me" which topped the U.S. pop chart in 1983.<br>
And he did, "I Don't Have the Heart", which became his second number-one in 1990.<br>
And he did the song, "Somewhere Out There," sang by Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram for the soundtrack of the animated film, An American Tail, which was released in 1986.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Michael McDonald (born in 1952) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, keyboardist, and record producer, known for his distinctive, soulful voice, and as a member of the bands, The Doobie Brothers (which started in 1975 and was still active as of January 2021) and he worked with Steely Dan (1974).<br>
Michael McDonald wrote and sang several hit singles with The Doobie Brothers, including "What a Fool Believes", "Minute By Minute", and "Takin' It to the Streets".<br>
<br>
McDonald's solo career consists of nine studio albums and a number of singles, including the 1982 hit "I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)". During his career, McDonald has collaborated with a number of other secular artists, including James Ingram, David Cassidy, Van Halen, Patti LaBelle, Lee Ritenour, the Winans, Aretha Franklin, the rock band Toto, Grizzly Bear, Joni Mitchell, and Thundercat.<br>
<br>
One popular secular song he was involved with, was, "This Is It," a song by American musician Kenny Loggins. It was released in 1979, and features additional vocals by Michael McDonald, who co-wrote the song with Kenny Loggins.<br>
He also released the single "On My Own", a duet with Patti LaBelle, which had reached number one on the U.S. charts in 1986.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Yah Mo B There" is an rhythm and blues (R&B) song recorded as a duet by American singers James Ingram and Michael McDonald. It was written by Ingram, McDonald, Rod Temperton and producer Quincy Jones. The song originally appeared on Ingram's 1983 album It's Your Night, released on Jones's Qwest Records label. It was released as a single in late 1983, peaking in 1984 at No. 19 on the U.S. chart and No. 44 on the UK Singles Chart.<br>
A remixed version by Jellybean Benitez hit No. 12 in the UK in the spring of 1985.<br>
It has subsequently appeared on several of Ingram's and McDonald's greatest hits albums, as well as various 1980s compilation albums of various artists.<br>
<br>
"Yah Mo B There" earned the duo a 1985 Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. It was one of a series of very successful duets involving Ingram. It also received a nomination for Best R&B Song.<br>
<br>
According to Michael McDonald, this was based on the original Hebrew name for God (Yahweh), and was originally called "Yahweh Be There." The title was James Ingram's idea: "We were talking about how to say 'God will be there' without scaring most of the audience away." It was co-written and produced by Quincy Jones (who does the African style sounds in the song) and Rod Temperton, who later wrote "Sweet Freedom" for McDonald (the theme from Running Scared).<br>
<br>
The actual spelling of the song title is Yah Mo B There. Yah is a shortened version of Yahweh, which means God in Hebrew. So the title literally means "God will be there" and is interpreted as "God be with you."<br>
<br>
Ingram and McDonald spelled things differently so as not to scare anyone away. The title has perplexed people since 1983. The idea behind the song was the religious teaching that nothing can save mankind except our Father in Heaven.<br>
<br>
<br>
James Ingram died in 2019, at the age of 66.<br>
<br>
The last album he released was in October of 2008.<br>
It was titled, Stand (In the Light).<br>
Stand (In the Light) is the fifth and final album by singer-songwriter James Ingram.<br>
<br>
In 2008, The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) interviewed James Ingram about this album.<br>
<br>
Here are some selected quoted parts from that interview.<br>
Heather Salon is interviewing James Ingram in 2008, and she begins with some<br>
of these quoted parts from her introduction.<br>
<br>
In 2008, Heather Salon said,<br>
James accepted Jesus in his life as a child and has never strayed from his father's words or the Christian faith. He is now 56-years-old and has been married to his childhood sweetheart for almost 35 years. They have six children, ages ranging from 15 to 32.<br>
James said the scripture his father engrained in him was Hebrews 11:1 "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." (KJV) Also, he taught James that he could do anything. With faith in God and confidence in himself, there was nothing he couldn't do.<br>
<br>
With the release of Stand (In the Light), people have asked James, 'if he has had a life of faith his whole life, why just make a Gospel album now? James replies that he has been writing Gospel since the early 1980s. His top hit, Yah Mo B There, is a song that he wrote to worship God in his own way. He wanted to praise God by His Hebrew name, but shortened it to "Yah" and wanted to use modern day language. Yah Mo B There, his hit with Michael McDonald, was the most played song in 1984.<br>
<br>
In 1983, James released his first solo album, It's Your Night, and collaborated with Michael McDonald on the song Yah Mo B There. This song was the most played song of that year and won a Grammy Award in 1984 for the Best Song by a Group or Duo.<br>
<br>
That is the end of the selected quoted parts from the 2008 interview.<br>
<br>
Technically, they were incorrect to say that this was the most played song of 1984.<br>
It was one of the most played songs of 1984, but it was not the most played song of 1984.<br>
<br>
The Billboard Hot 100 is the music industry standard record chart in the United States for songs, published weekly by Billboard magazine. Chart rankings are based on sales (physical and digital), radio play, and online streaming in the United States.<br>
From that weekly chart, they produce a year-end chart.<br>
The Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1984<br>
says that the number one secular song of 1984 was,<br>
"When Doves Cry" by Prince.<br>
"Yah Mo B There" by James Ingram and Michael McDonald<br>
landed at position number 100 on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles chart of 1984.<br>
This means that there were 99 other secular songs that had more radio-play and greater popularity<br>
than the song, Yah Mo B There.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The song was released on 9 December 1983,<br>
but did not gain popularity until 1984.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 1983 song, Yah Mo B There<br>
by American singers, James Ingram and Michael McDonald.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Heavenly Father watching us fall<br>
We take from each other and give nothing at all<br>
Well it's a dog-gone shame<br>

No matter how many dreams slip away<br>
Yah will be there<br>
<br>
Well it's a dog-gone shame<br>
But never too late for change<br>
So when your luck runs low<br>
Just reach out and call His name<br>
Just call His name<br>
<br>
<br>
Yah mo be there (up and over)<br>
Yah mo be there (up and over)<br>
Yah mo be there (up and over)<br>
Yah mo be there (up and over)<br>
Whenever you call<br>
Yah will be there<br>

<a name="JAH21GLOHRN"></a><h2>Horn</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Horn<br>
<br>
<br>
After the Birth of John the Baptist,<br>
his dad, Zechariah, could speak again, and he began praising God.<br>
John the Baptist's dad, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and he gave a prophecy,<br>
which included this verse right here...<br>
<br>
Luke 1:69 (KJV)<br>
And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;<br>
<br>
<br>
Targeting this verse 69, here is a slightly bigger sample of Zechariah's Prophecy, in the NLT...<br>
<br>
Luke 1: 68-71 NLT<br>
68<br>
"Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,<br>
because he has visited and redeemed his people.<br>
(He has raised up a horn of salvation for us, from the royal line of his servant David)<br>
69<br>
He has sent us a mighty Saviour<br>
from the royal line of his servant David,<br>
70<br>
just as he promised<br>
through his holy prophets long ago.<br>
71<br>
Now we will be saved from our enemies<br>
and from all who hate us.<br>
<br>
In Luke 1:69, the Greek word that was translated into the English word, Horn,<br>
the Greek word right there is pronounced, Ked-Ahs.<br>
It means, horn.<br>
Since animals defend themselves with their horns, a horn is a symbol of strength and courage, equivalent to a mighty and valiant helper, the author of deliverance, and is being used here as a symbol of the Messiah.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 22:3 (KJV)<br>
The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.<br>
<br>
Looking at this verse that we just read, 2 Samuel 22:3,<br>
The Hebrew word for, horn, being used right here, is pronounced, Kedren.<br>
It means, horn. A symbol of strength.<br>
flask (a container for oil)<br>
horn (as a musical instrument)<br>
horn (the horn-like projections on the altar)<br>
horn can also refer to rays of light<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 18:2 (KJV)<br>
The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew for horn, here, is also, Kedren.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 148:12-14 KJV<br>
12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:<br>
(Let them praise the name of the Lord: for his name alone is exalted;)<br>
13 Let them praise the name of the Lord: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.<br>
14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew for horn, here in verse 14, is also, Kedren.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 148:12-14 NLT<br>
12<br>
young men and young women,<br>
old men and children.<br>
13<br>
Let them all praise the name of the Lord.<br>
For his name is very great;<br>
his glory towers over the earth and heaven!<br>
14<br>
He has made his people strong,<br>
honouring his faithful ones --<br>
the people of Israel who are close to him.<br>
Praise the Lord!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is something that we looked at when we did the Bible Study, titled, Light and Darkness,<br>
back in Christian Essays 5, The Bible's Greatest Hits, chapter 5.<br>
<br>
Exodus 34: 29-35 KJV<br>
29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.<br>
30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.<br>
31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.<br>
32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount Sinai.<br>
33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.<br>
34 But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.<br>
35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 34: 29-35 NLT<br>
29 When Moses came down Mount Sinai carrying the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant, he wasn't aware that his face had become radiant because he had spoken to the Lord.<br>
30 So when Aaron and the people of Israel saw the radiance of Moses' face, they were afraid to come near him.<br>
31 But Moses called out to them and asked Aaron and all the leaders of the community to come over, and he talked with them.<br>
32 Then all the people of Israel approached him, and Moses gave them all the instructions the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.<br>
33 When Moses finished speaking with them, he covered his face with a veil.<br>
34 But whenever he went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with the Lord, he would remove the veil until he came out again. Then he would give the people whatever instructions the Lord had given him,<br>
35 and the people of Israel would see the radiant glow of his face. So he would put the veil over his face until he returned to speak with the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the KJV, verses 29, 30 and 35 all have the English word, shone, in the KJV.<br>
The NLT used the words, radiant and radiance.<br>
That Hebrew word there, in verses 29, 30 and 35 were all translated from the same Hebrew word, pronounced, Kadran.<br>
Kadran, means, to push or gore, shoot out horns or rays, have horns, or shine<br>
to shine, to send out rays, to display or grow horns, be horned<br>
to radiate, to emit beams, to shine<br>
<br>
Most of the modern day torches or flashlights have inside them a horn-shaped part, as in, a trumpet horn shape, a cone shape, or a funnel shape,<br>
to help send out the beam of light.<br>
<br>
If you were to look and compare the Hebrew characters, and compare the Hebrew words, Kedren, and, Kadran,<br>
they sound very similar, and the characters look almost the same.<br>
Kedren has little dots that make two small triangles below two letters.<br>
Kadran has a small stroke or dash below one character, and a little stroke and a dot below a second character.<br>
The main Hebrew letters are the same for both words.  The small dots and dashes below the letters are the only way to tell these two Hebrew words apart.<br>
<br>
In past centuries, most common people did not know how to read or write, and English Bibles were not really around much at all until just the last few most recent centuries.<br>
When you go back more than 500 years, back in those days, the only way to know what was in the Bible was for someone to read it to you -- the priest or pastor of a church would read what they wanted to -- translating it from a Greek or Latin translation.<br>
If the Greek or Latin translation had any inaccuracies, those mistakes would produce inaccurate readings, and wrong understandings, and mis-interpretations of scripture.<br>
It was not bad enough that everyone relied on a human priest or pastor to control and interpret what amount of Bible was read out loud to the people.<br>
If he made a mistake or left something out, no one would know.<br>
That imperfect human could control, manipulate and interpret the Bible they way they wanted to, and no one could question or verify the accuracy of the reading or teaching.<br>
Because of these limitations, people relied on stained-glass windows to remind people of the popular stories in the Bible.<br>
Since most common people could not read or write, or the common English people could not read the Greek and Latin Bibles kept in the church,<br>
The old English churches in the United Kingdom used many stained-glass windows to remind people about some of the stories in the Bible.<br>
That way, people could remember stories in the Bible even though they could not read a Bible.<br>
With translations having inaccuracies, and humans not interpreting or understanding the translations well, the two words we looked at earlier,<br>
Kedren, and, Kadran, got mixed up and mis-interpreted in some old translations,<br>
and that is why, in England, there are stained-glass windows that show Moses having horns,<br>
and that is why there are some old statues of Moses showing Moses with horns.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reviewing again, the Hebrew words, Kedren, and, Kadran,<br>
It is the same Hebrew letters; it's the vowel sounds that change.<br>
How can you tell what vowel sounds to make when the Hebrew letters are the same?<br>
<br>
Kedren -- horn, or rays of light<br>
Kadran -- push or gore, shoot out horns or rays, have horns, or shine, to radiate, to emit beams, to shine<br>
<br>
They sound very similar, and the Hebrew characters look almost the same.<br>
Kedren has little dots that make two small triangles below two letters.<br>
Kadran has a small stroke or dash below one character, and a little stroke and a dot below a second character.<br>
As for those little marks that specify what kind of vowel sounds to make,<br>
those marks did not originally exist in the ancient Paleo-Hebrew, which is why it could be easy to get<br>
the vowel sounds for Kedren and Kadran mixed up, as it happened accidentally in a Latin translation.<br>
Before those vowel-sounding marks were invented, all you could do is to take a guess on how to make the vowel sounds.<br>
Someone guessed wrong in a Latin translation, and so there is a stained-glass window and a statue of Moses showing him with horns, instead of glowing.<br>
This vowel-guessing mistake also did happen in the KJV.<br>
The NLT team saw the mistake and fixed it in the NLT.<br>
You can easily see the Kedren and Kadran mistake in the KJV and the fix in the NLT right here in Habakkuk 3:4.<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 3:4 -- KJV<br>
(God's) brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.<br>
((God's) brightness was as the light; he had bright beams out of his side: and there was the hiding of his power.)<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 3:4 -- NLT<br>
(God's) coming is as brilliant as the sunrise.<br>
Rays of light flash from his hands,<br>
where his awesome power is hidden.<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 3:4 -- TS2009<br>
And the brightness is as the light, He has rays from His hand, And there His power is hidden.<br>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, we can see how tricky things like this can easily result in language translation mistakes.<br>

<br>
Up Down Poor Rich<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 10:22 (KJV)<br>
The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 10:22 (NLT)<br>
The blessing of the Lord makes a person rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 13:22 (KJV)<br>
A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 13:22 (NLT)<br>
Good people leave an inheritance to their grandchildren, but the sinner's wealth passes to the godly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37:16 (KJV)<br>
A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.<br>
<br>
Psalms 37:16 (NLT)<br>
It is better to be godly and have little than to be evil and rich.<br>
<br>
Daniel 2:21 (KJV)<br>
And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:<br>
<br>
Daniel 2:21 (NLT)<br>
He controls the course of world events; he removes kings and sets up other kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the scholars.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  As we are about to see here in this Bible Study,<br>
It is the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah who raises people up and lowers people down.<br>
He humbles and he exalts.<br>
He does not vote them into office, he places them in and removes them out.<br>
You can vote all you want, but it is the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah who puts people into their Government jobs, and takes them out again later.<br>
He casts in and he casts out.<br>
He makes people poor and he makes people rich.<br>
<br>
When we were at the end of Christian Essays 18,<br>
the Bible's Greatest Hits, chapter 18,<br>
we read Proverbs 30: 7-9.<br>
Let's look at that again, and then, at the end of this Bible study, we will look at something in Hannah's Prayer of Praise<br>
which is in 1 Samuel 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's start by reading again, Proverbs 30: 7-9 KJV<br>
7<br>
Two things have I required of thee;<br>
(withhold not from me before I die:)<br>
deny me them not before I die:<br>
8<br>
Remove far from me vanity and lies:<br>
give me neither poverty nor riches;<br>
(feed me with food of my allowance for me:)<br>
feed me with food convenient for me:<br>
9<br>
(Lest I be full, and belie thee, and say, Who is the Lord?)<br>
Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord?<br>
or lest I be poor, and steal,<br>
and take the name of my God in vain.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 30: 7-9 NLT<br>
7<br>
O God, I beg two favours from you;<br>
let me have them before I die.<br>
8<br>
First, help me never to tell a lie.<br>
Second, give me neither poverty nor riches!<br>
Give me just enough to satisfy my needs.<br>
9<br>
For if I grow rich, I may deny you and say, "Who is the Lord?"<br>
And if I am too poor, I may steal and thus insult God's holy name.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 10: 17-31 (KJV)<br>
17 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?<br>
18 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.<br>
19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.<br>
20 And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.<br>
21 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.<br>
22 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.<br>
23 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<br>
24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!<br>
25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<br>
26 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?<br>
27 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.<br>
28 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.<br>
29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,<br>
30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.<br>
31 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 10: 17-31 NLT<br>
17 As Jesus was starting out on his way to Jerusalem, a man came running up to him, knelt down, and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"<br>
18 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus asked. "Only God is truly good.<br>
19 But to answer your question, you know the commandments: 'You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. You must not cheat anyone. Honour your father and mother.'"<br>
(quoting from Exodus 20:12-16; and Deuteronomy 5:16-20)<br>
<br>
<br>
20 "Teacher," the man replied, "I've obeyed all these commandments since I was young."<br>
21 Looking at the man, Jesus felt genuine love for him. "There is still one thing you haven't done," he told him. "Go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."<br>
22 At this the man's face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.<br>
23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!"<br>
<br>
24 This amazed them. But Jesus said again, "Dear children, it is very hard to enter the Kingdom of God.<br>
(This amazed them. But Jesus said again, "Dear children, it is very hard for those who trust in riches to enter the Kingdom of God.)<br>
25 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!"<br>
26 The disciples were astounded. "Then who in the world can be saved?" they asked.<br>
27 Jesus looked at them intently and said, "Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But not with God. Everything is possible with God."<br>
28 Then Peter began to speak up. "We've given up everything to follow you," he said.<br>
29 "Yes," Jesus replied, "and I assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property, for my sake and for the Good News,<br>
30 will receive now in return a hundred times as many houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and property -- along with persecution. And in the world to come that person will have eternal life.<br>
31 But many who are the greatest now will be least important then, and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then."<br>
(But many who are first will be last; and the last, first.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 18: 18-30 (KJV)<br>
18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?<br>
19 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.<br>
20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.<br>
21 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.<br>
22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.<br>
23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.<br>
24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<br>
25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<br>
26 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?<br>
27 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.<br>
28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.<br>
29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,<br>
30 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 18: 18-30 NLT<br>
18 Once a religious leader asked Jesus this question: "Good Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?"<br>
19 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus asked him. "Only God is truly good.<br>
20 But to answer your question, you know the commandments: 'You must not commit adultery. You must not murder. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. Honour your father and mother.'"<br>
(quoting from Exodus 20:12-16; and Deuteronomy 5:16-20)<br>
<br>
21 The man replied, "I've obeyed all these commandments since I was young."<br>
22 When Jesus heard his answer, he said, "There is still one thing you haven't done. Sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."<br>
23 But when the man heard this he became very sad, for he was very rich.<br>
24 When Jesus saw this, (When Jesus saw how sad the man was,) he said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!<br>
25 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!"<br>
26 Those who heard this said, "Then who in the world can be saved?"<br>
27 He replied, "What is impossible for people is possible with God."<br>
28 Peter said, "We've left our homes to follow you."<br>
29 "Yes," Jesus replied, "and I assure you that everyone who has given up house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the Kingdom of God,<br>
30 will be repaid many times over in this life, and will have eternal life in the world to come."<br>
<br>
Commentary:  If children want to get baptised, if they want to go to church, and do Bible studies and Torah studies, Jesus Christ commands us not to stop them.<br>
If you stop children, discourage them, hinder them, restrict them or talk them out of wanting to get baptised, or wanting to go to church services, Bible studies or Torah studies, then you are disobeying a commandment in the Bible, a commandment that is given to us at least three times.<br>
The Lord Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, gives us the commandment in Matthew, Mark and Luke.<br>
We just happen to begin our reading today right after he gives the commandment.<br>
If you were to have starting reading in those places we just looked at in Mark and Luke, right before the spot where we started reading, God gives us this commandment through Jesus.<br>
Let's look at it one time, here in Matthew 19.<br>
Since Jesus is Lord, and the Lord God is Jesus, the Commandments in the New Testament are just as important to obey as the Commandments in the Old Testament.<br>
It is a commandment of the Lord Jesus Christ not to stop children from coming to him.<br>
This commandment is in the new testament, and is just before the story that we have been reading today.<br>
<br>
Here is the end of that teaching, giving us that commandment, in Matthew 19.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 19: 14-30 (KJV)<br>
14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
15 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.<br>
16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?<br>
17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.<br>
18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,<br>
19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?<br>
21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.<br>
22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.<br>
23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br>
24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<br>
25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?<br>
26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.<br>
27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?<br>
28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br>
29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.<br>
30 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Son of Man is a title Jesus used for himself.<br>
Some of the original, hand-written copies of the New Testament have slightly different wording, which is also shown here within round brackets.<br>
<br>
Matthew 19: 13-30 NLT<br>
13 One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him.<br>
14 But Jesus said, "Let the children come to me. Don't stop them! For the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to those who are like these children."<br>
15 And he placed his hands on their heads and blessed them before he left.<br>
<br>
16 Someone came to Jesus with this question: "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"<br>
("Good Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?")<br>
17 "Why ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. But to answer your question --<br>
if you want to receive eternal life, keep the commandments."<br>
(if you want to receive eternal life, continue to keep the commandments.")<br>
<br>
18 "Which ones?" the man asked.<br>
And Jesus replied: "'You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely.<br>
19 Honour your father and mother. Love your neighbour as yourself.'"<br>
(Jesus is quoting from Exodus 20:12-16; from Deuteronomy 5:16-20; and the "Love your neighbour" command is a quote from Leviticus 19:18.)<br>
<br>
20 "I've obeyed all these commandments," the young man replied. "What else must I do?"<br>
21 Jesus told him, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."<br>
22 But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had many possessions.<br>
23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is very hard for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.<br>
24 I'll say it again -- it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!"<br>
25 The disciples were astounded. "Then who in the world can be saved?" they asked.<br>
26 Jesus looked at them intently and said, "Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But with God everything is possible."<br>
27 Then Peter said to him, "We've given up everything to follow you. What will we get?"<br>
<br>
28 Jesus replied, "I assure you that when the world is made new (in the regeneration) and the Son of Man sits upon his glorious throne, you who have been my followers will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br>
29 And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property, for my sake, will receive a hundred times as much in return and will inherit eternal life.<br>
<br>
30 But many who are the greatest now will be least important then, and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then.<br>
(But many who are first will be last; and the last, first.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To illustrate this, what Jesus just said there in verse 30, he gives them a parable in the next chapter, Matthew 20.<br>
We read that story, the Parable of the Vineyard Workers, back in Christian Essays 6, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 6,<br>
when we did the Bible study, titled, The Hired and The Prodigal.<br>
Here's a quick review of how the parable ended in the NLT...<br>
<br>
Matthew 20: 12-16 NLT<br>
12 'Those people worked only one hour, and yet you've paid them just as much as you paid us who worked all day in the scorching heat.'<br>
13 "He answered one of them, 'Friend, I haven't been unfair! Didn't you agree to work all day for the usual wage?<br>
14 Take your money and go. I wanted to pay this last worker the same as you.<br>
15 Is it against the law for me to do what I want with my money? Should you be jealous because I am kind to others?'<br>
16 "So those who are last now will be first then, and those who are first will be last."<br>
<br>
Matthew 20:16 (KJV)<br>
So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.<br>
<br>
As we now bring this Bible study to its conclusion, we finish this study by looking at an interesting portion of something in Hannah's Prayer of Praise.<br>
Hannah's Prayer for a Son is answered when she finally gives birth to Samuel, and that is why she gives this Prayer of Praise.<br>
Let us first focus on the key verse that we are targeting, which is verse 7.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 2:7 (NIV)<br>
The Lord sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.<br>
<br>
(1 Samuel) 2:7 (TS2009)<br>
"Yaw-Who-Wah makes poor and makes rich, He brings low and lifts up.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 2:7 (KJV)<br>
The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 2:7 (NLT)<br>
The Lord makes some poor and others rich; he brings some down and lifts others up.<br>
<br>
With that verse 7 in mind, let's now read all 10 verses of Hannah's Prayer of Praise.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 2: 1-10 KJV<br>
1 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted in the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.<br>
2 There is none holy as the Lord: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.<br>
<br>
3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly;<br>
(let not hard come out of your mouth)<br>
let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.<br>
<br>
4 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.<br>
5 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.<br>
6 The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.<br>
7 The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.<br>
8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and he hath set the world upon them.<br>
9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.<br>
10 The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 2: 1-10 NLT<br>
1<br>
Then Hannah prayed:<br>
"My heart rejoices in the Lord!<br>
(The Lord has exalted my horn.)<br>
The Lord has made me strong.<br>
Now I have an answer for my enemies;<br>
I rejoice because you rescued me.<br>
2<br>
No one is holy like the Lord!<br>
There is no one besides you;<br>
there is no Rock like our God.<br>
3<br>
"Stop acting so proud and haughty!<br>
Don't speak with such arrogance!<br>
For the Lord is a God who knows what you have done;<br>
he will judge your actions.<br>
4<br>
The bow of the mighty is now broken,<br>
and those who stumbled are now strong.<br>
5<br>
Those who were well fed are now starving,<br>
and those who were starving are now full.<br>
The childless woman now has seven children,<br>
and the woman with many children wastes away.<br>
<br>
6<br>
The Lord gives both death and life;<br>
he brings some down to the grave but raises others up.<br>
(he brings some down to Sheol but raises others up.)<br>
<br>
7<br>
The Lord makes some poor and others rich;<br>
he brings some down and lifts others up.<br>
8<br>
He lifts the poor from the dust<br>
and the needy from the garbage dump.<br>
He sets them among princes,<br>
placing them in seats of honour.<br>
For all the earth is the Lord's,<br>
and he has set the world in order.<br>
9<br>
"He will protect his faithful ones,<br>
but the wicked will disappear in darkness.<br>
No one will succeed by strength alone.<br>
<br>
10<br>
Those who fight against the Lord will be shattered.<br>
He thunders against them from heaven;<br>
the Lord judges throughout the earth.<br>
He gives power to his king;<br>
he increases the strength of his anointed one."<br>
(he exalts the horn of his anointed one.)<br>

<br>
There's a little lesson we can learn from the book of 2 Samuel.<br>
In 2 Samuel 5, David Becomes King of All Israel, David Captures Jerusalem, and then, that brings us to the section that we will study here next,<br>
where David Conquers the Philistines.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 5: 17-25 KJV<br>
17 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.<br>
18 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.<br>
19 And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.<br>
20 And David came to Baal -- perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.<br>
(Baal -- perazim means, the plain of breaches.)<br>
<br>
21 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.<br>
(or, David and his men took them away.)<br>
<br>
22 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.<br>
23 And when David enquired of the Lord, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.<br>
24 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the Lord go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.<br>
<br>
25 And David did so, as the Lord had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba (also known as Gibeon) until thou come to Gezer.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 5: 17-25 NLT<br>
17 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of Israel, they mobilised all their forces to capture him. But David was told they were coming, so he went into the stronghold.<br>
18 The Philistines arrived and spread out across the valley of Rephaim.<br>
19<br>
So David asked the Lord, "Should I go out to fight the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?"<br>
The Lord replied to David, "Yes, go ahead. I will certainly hand them over to you."<br>
20 So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there. "The Lord did it!" David exclaimed. "He burst through my enemies like a raging flood!" So he named that place Baal-perazim (which means "the Lord who bursts through").<br>
21 The Philistines had abandoned their idols there, so David and his men confiscated them.<br>
22 But after a while the Philistines returned and again spread out across the valley of Rephaim.<br>
23 And again David asked the Lord what to do. "Do not attack them straight on," the Lord replied. "Instead, circle around behind and attack them near the poplar trees.<br>
(The exact identification of this tree is uncertain. It may have more likely have been poplar trees, but it could have also been aspen trees or balsam trees.)<br>
<br>
24 When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the poplar trees, be on the alert! That will be the signal that the Lord is moving ahead of you to strike down the Philistine army."<br>
25 So David did what the Lord commanded, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.<br>
(The Greek version says, from Gibeon to Gezer. The original Hebrew says, from Geba to Gezer.)<br>
<br>
And then, in the next chapter, Chapter 6, David tries to move the Ark to Jerusalem.<br>
Unfortunately, they did not follow the instructions in the Bible, the Torah.<br>
They were supposed to carry it using long carrying poles that went through special rings on the Ark made for that purpose.<br>
Instead, they tried to transport it on a cart pulled by oxen.  Big goof!<br>
Read the instruction manual first!<br>
<br>
Commentary:  The important lesson to learn here in chapter 5, is to pray about it first.<br>
And, since I mentioned it, the second important lesson sitting there in chapter 6 would be,<br>
read the entire Bible first, the entire Torah. Someone died there in chapter 6, because they were doing it wrong.<br>
Here in chapter 5, David was very smart to pray about what to do, before doing it.<br>
It would have seemed obvious what the next step is, but just because the next step seems so obvious and easy,<br>
does not mean that it's right.<br>
Apparently, the enemy was anticipating David to repeat his method of attack again in the same way, but the Lord knew that.<br>
The Lord Yaw-Who-Wah knew that they were expecting King David to attack in the same, direct kind of way again, but David prayed about it first.<br>
And the Lord worked with David and provided a totally different plan, that no one could possibly have expected.<br>
He can give you unexpected, surprise victories and accomplishments like that, coming in from a direction that does not seem logical or expected.<br>
The most visible path, the easiest path, and the most direct, most logical and shortest path, may not be the right path.<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember again, what we looked at in Bonus verse number 8, back in The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter Zero...<br>
<br>
John 14:6 (KJV)<br>
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>
<br>
John 14:6 (NLT)<br>
Jesus told him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:12 (KJV)<br>
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:12 (NLT)<br>
There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3:6 (KJV)<br>
...he shall direct thy paths.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3:6 (NLT)<br>
Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 23:3 (KJV)<br>
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.<br>
<br>
Psalms 23:3 (NLT)<br>
He renews my strength. He guides me along right paths, bringing honour to his name.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 25:4 (KJV)<br>
Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths.<br>
<br>
Psalms 25:4 (NLT)<br>
Show me the right path, O Lord; point out the road for me to follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:2 (KJV)<br>
He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 14:2 (NLT)<br>
Those who follow the right path fear the Lord; those who take the wrong path despise him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:11 (KJV)<br>
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:11 (NLT)<br>
Teach me how to live, O Lord. Lead me along the right path, for my enemies are waiting for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's finish this little study here with a quick prayer.<br>
<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, Dear Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
From a personal and rather selfish perspective, I want to walk down the right path that leads to Better, for myself, personally, and for my family.<br>
I want to always be asking, seeking, knocking, and searching for Better, a better place to work, a better, safer place to live, as in our personal<br>
home, property and land, and a better, and safer place to live,<br>
in terms of where we are located and where we should be located next, in terms of this prayer being applied to the community, the city, and general country or geographic region that we live in.<br>
I want better finances, better provisions, with moments of generosity and abundance, receiving abundantly so I can give abundantly, I want better friendships, better fellowships, better relationships, better Bible studies and better Torah studies.<br>
I want our needs met, and I want to have blessing, abundance, safety, protection, and to feel like I'm in a place that is of value, a place that is giving me a sense of value and purpose, a place where I feel like I belong and I have people I can love on, and have people in my life that love me and accept me.<br>
I want myself and my family to be safe, to be loved, and to live in security, in peace, in safety, with all of our needs abundantly met.<br>
Give us your Holy Spirit, Your Word of God, your way, your truth, your salvation, your righteousness, your power, your wisdom, and your peace.<br>
<br>
I also know, and I confess that this prayer thus far is a bit selfish.  I also know that, the reason why I exist is to give you pleasure, Lord Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
We exist to give you glory, to give you pleasure, to do what pleases you, to love you, and to love and help others with their needs,<br>
and to help others with their relationship with you.  Help us not judge.  Help us show mercy and compassion and forgiveness.  Help us forgive one another and love one another. With intercessory prayer, help us pray for one another and minister to each other.<br>
Help us carry out your will, your desires, your purposes, and your plans, for your glory, for your kingdom, helping others receive your salvation, your gospel, your good news, your mercy and your grace, and your Torah and your Word, help us love and teach others so that we can help strengthen and improve the relationships that we have with each other and the relationships and friendships that we each have with you.  Help us walk on and stay on the right path, according to your will. Cast out all that does not belong, cast in all that is lacking or missing, heal us, deliver us from all evil, save us, help us, and take all that is wrong and make it right.<br>
-- In Jesus' name, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Amen, Ah-Main.<br>
