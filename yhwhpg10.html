In the letter that Paul wrote to Titus, he told Titus, in chapter 3, to Remind the believers to Do What Is Good.<br>
Let's take a look at a little sample of it, in Chapter 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 3: 2-9 KJV<br>
-- In the KJV, Titus is being told to Remind the believers...<br>
2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.<br>
3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.<br>
4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,<br>
5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;<br>
6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;<br>
7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<br>
8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.<br>
9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 3: 2-9 NLT<br>
-- In the NLT, Titus is being told to Remind the believers that...<br>
2 They must not slander anyone and must avoid quarrelling. Instead, they should be gentle and show true humility to everyone.<br>
3 Once we, too, were foolish and disobedient. We were misled and became slaves to many lusts and pleasures. Our lives were full of evil and envy, and we hated each other.<br>
4 But -- When God our Saviour revealed his kindness and love,<br>
5 he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit.<br>
(He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.)<br>
6 He generously poured out the Spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Saviour.<br>
7 Because of his grace he made us right in his sight and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life.<br>
8 This is a trustworthy saying, and I want you to insist on these teachings so that all who trust in God will devote themselves to doing good. These teachings are good and beneficial for everyone.<br>
9 Do not get involved in foolish discussions about spiritual pedigrees (or spiritual genealogies, and do not get involved) in quarrels and fights about obedience to Jewish laws. These things are useless and a waste of time.<br>

Back when we did our Bible Study on Commandments (Christian Essays 3), we mentioned this...<br>
<br>
Psalms 51:10<br>
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.<br>
NLT<br>
Create in me a clean heart, O God.<br>
Renew a loyal spirit within me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36:26<br>
KJV<br>
26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36:25-27<br>
NLT, starting in verse 25, through verse 27<br>
25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship idols.<br>
26 And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart (a heart of flesh.)<br>
27 And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.<br>
<br>
and then the Commentary that I said at that time was this...<br>
Commentary: He is not just doing this remodelling so he can flip a house and re-sell it, like you see on the Home and Garden TV channel (HGTV), he's doing the remodel so that he can call your heart his forever home.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 3: 14 through 19 (KJV)<br>
14 I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,<br>
16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;<br>
17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,<br>
18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;<br>
19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 3:17 (NLT)<br>
Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God's love and keep you strong.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a little extra something that we did not mention at that time.<br>
<br>
John 14: verse 23 KJV<br>
23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14: verse 23 NLT<br>
23 Jesus replied, "All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14: 10-31 KJV<br>
Jesus says,<br>
10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.<br>
11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.<br>
12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.<br>
13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<br>
14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.<br>
15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.<br>
16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;<br>
17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.<br>
18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<br>
19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.<br>
20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<br>
21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.<br>
22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?<br>
23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.<br>
24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.<br>
25 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.<br>
26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.<br>
27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.<br>
28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.<br>
29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.<br>
30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.<br>
31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14: 10-31 NLT<br>
Jesus says,<br>
10 Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak are not my own, but my Father who lives in me does his work through me.<br>
11 Just believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or at least believe because of the work you have seen me do.<br>
12 "I tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works, because I am going to be with the Father.<br>
13 You can ask for anything in my name, and I will do it, so that the Son can bring glory to the Father.<br>
14 Yes, ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it!<br>
15 "If you love me, obey my commandments.<br>
(If you love me, you will obey my commandments.)<br>
(If you love me, you should obey my commandments.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, who will never leave you.<br>
(And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, Encourager, Counsellor, Paraclete who will never leave you.)<br>
<br>
<br>
17 He is the Holy Spirit, who leads into all truth. The world cannot receive him, because it isn't looking for him and doesn't recognise him. But you know him, because he lives with you now and later will be in you (and is in you).<br>
18 No, I will not abandon you as orphans -- I will come to you.<br>
19 Soon the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Since I live, you also will live.<br>
20 When I am raised to life again, you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.<br>
21 Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them."<br>
22 Judas (not Judas Iscariot, but the other disciple with that name) said to him, "Lord, why are you going to reveal yourself only to us and not to the world at large?"<br>
23 Jesus replied, "All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.<br>
24 Anyone who doesn't love me will not obey me. And remember, my words are not my own. What I am telling you is from the Father who sent me.<br>
25 I am telling you these things now whilst I am still with you.<br>
26 But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative -- that is, the Holy Spirit -- he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you.<br>
27 "I am leaving you with a gift -- peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don't be troubled or afraid.<br>
28 Remember what I told you: I am going away, but I will come back to you again. If you really loved me, you would be happy that I am going to the Father, who is greater than I am.<br>
29 I have told you these things before they happen so that when they do happen, you will believe.<br>
30 "I don't have much more time to talk to you, because the ruler of this world approaches. He has no power over me,<br>
31 but I will do what the Father requires of me, so that the world will know that I love the Father. Come, let's be going.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119: 1-24<br>
We are only looking at verses 1 through 24<br>
This chapter has 176 verses!<br>
KJV<br>
1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.<br>
(Blessed are the perfect in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.)<br>
(Blessed are the sincere in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.)<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.<br>
3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.<br>
4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.<br>
5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!<br>
6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.<br>
<br>
<br>
7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgements,<br>
(I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy judgements of thy righteousness).<br>
<br>
8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.<br>
9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.<br>
10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.<br>
11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.<br>
12 Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy statutes.<br>
13 With my lips have I declared all the judgements of thy mouth.<br>
14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.<br>
15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.<br>
16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.<br>
17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.<br>
<br>
<br>
18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.<br>
(Reveal thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.)<br>
<br>
19 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.<br>
20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgements at all times.<br>
21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.<br>
22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.<br>
23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.<br>
<br>
<br>
24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.<br>
(Thy testimonies also are my delight and men of my counsel.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119: 1-24<br>
NLT<br>
<br>
Psalms 119 is a Hebrew acrostic poem; there are twenty-two stanzas, one for each successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Each of the eight verses within each stanza begins with the Hebrew letter named in its heading.<br>
Since we are only looking at verses 1 through 24, we do not mention the Hebrew letters here at this time.<br>
Since there are 22 Hebrew Letters in the Hebrew alphabet, and each letter has eight verses,<br>
22 multiplied by eight, equals 176 verses in this Psalms chapter 119.<br>
<br>
1<br>
Joyful are people of integrity,<br>
who follow the instructions of the Lord.<br>
2<br>
Joyful are those who obey his laws<br>
and search for him with all their hearts.<br>
3<br>
They do not compromise with evil,<br>
and they walk only in his paths.<br>
4<br>
You have charged us<br>
to keep your commandments carefully.<br>
5<br>
Oh, that my actions would consistently<br>
reflect your decrees!<br>
6<br>
Then I will not be ashamed<br>
when I compare my life with your commands.<br>
7<br>
As I learn your righteous regulations,<br>
I will thank you by living as I should!<br>
8<br>
I will obey your decrees.<br>
Please don't give up on me!<br>
9<br>
How can a young person stay pure?<br>
By obeying your word.<br>
10<br>
I have tried hard to find you -- <br>
don't let me wander from your commands.<br>
11<br>
I have hidden your word in my heart,<br>
that I might not sin against you.<br>
12<br>
I praise you, O Lord;<br>
teach me your decrees.<br>
13<br>
I have recited aloud<br>
all the regulations you have given us.<br>
14<br>
I have rejoiced in your laws<br>
as much as in riches.<br>
15<br>
I will study your commandments<br>
and reflect on your ways.<br>
16<br>
I will delight in your decrees<br>
and not forget your word.<br>
17<br>
Be good to your servant,<br>
that I may live and obey your word.<br>
18<br>
Open my eyes to see<br>
the wonderful truths in your instructions.<br>
19<br>
I am only a foreigner in the land.<br>
Don't hide your commands from me!<br>
20<br>
I am always overwhelmed<br>
with a desire for your regulations.<br>
21<br>
You rebuke the arrogant;<br>
those who wander from your commands are cursed.<br>
22<br>
Don't let them scorn and insult me,<br>
for I have obeyed your laws.<br>
23<br>
Even princes sit and speak against me,<br>
but I will meditate on your decrees.<br>
24<br>
Your laws please me;<br>
they give me wise advice.<br>

Numbers 10: 34 - 36 KJV<br>
34 And the cloud of the Lord was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.<br>
35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.<br>
36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel.<br>
(And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the ten thousand thousands of Israel.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 10: 33 - 36<br>
NLT<br>
33 They marched for three days after leaving the mountain of the Lord, with the Ark of the Lord's Covenant moving ahead of them to show them where to stop and rest.<br>
34 As they moved on each day, the cloud of the Lord hovered over them.<br>
35 And whenever the Ark set out, Moses would shout, "Arise, O Lord, and let your enemies be scattered! Let them flee before you!"<br>
36 And when the Ark was set down, he would say, "Return, O Lord, to the countless thousands of Israel!"<br>

<br>
Zechariah's Prophecies<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Zechariah chapters 3, 4 and 5, reading to chapter 5, verse 4<br>
We start in Zechariah chapter 3, verse 1...<br>
KJV<br>
1 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.<br>
(And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and an adversary standing at his right hand to be his adversary, to resist him.)<br>
<br>
<br>
2 And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?<br>
3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.<br>
4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.<br>
5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord stood by.<br>
6 And the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua, saying,<br>
<br>
<br>
7 Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk amongst these that stand by.<br>
(Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my ordinance, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee walks to walk amongst these that stand by.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: (for they are a sign, for they are men of wonder,) for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.<br>
10 In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.<br>
1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,<br>
<br>
<br>
2 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:<br>
(And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with her bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven, several pipes to the lamps, which are upon the top thereof:)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3 And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.<br>
4 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?<br>
5 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, (Not by army,) Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7 Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8 Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,<br>
9 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you.<br>
<br>
<br>
10 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.<br>
(For who hath despised the day of small things? since the seven eyes of the Lord shall rejoice, and shall see the stone of tin in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.)<br>
<br>
<br>
11 Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
12 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?<br>
(And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the gold out of themselves?)<br>
(And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which by the hand of the two golden pipes empty out of themselves oil into the gold?)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
13 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
14 Then said he, (These are the two sons of oil,) These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.<br>
2 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one of this people that stealeth holdeth himself guiltless, as it doth;)<br>
3 Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4 I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Coming up next here in the NLT, when you see the word, Jeshua, the original Hebrew word is, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
We will continue looking at some additional material that is also here in the book of Zechariah, but, to keep it short and easy to follow along, we will just look at this additional material just in the NLT, here in just a moment.<br>
But first, let's read again, Zechariah chapters 3, 4 and 5, reading to chapter 5, verse 4<br>
in the NLT -- starting again in Zechariah chapter 3, verse 1...<br>
1 Then the angel showed me Jeshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord. The Accuser, Satan, was there at the angel's right hand, making accusations against Jeshua.<br>
<br>
(Then the angel showed me Joshua, the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord. The satan was there at the angel's right hand, making accusations against Joshua.)<br>
<br>
<br>
2 And the Lord said to Satan, "I, the Lord, reject your accusations, Satan. Yes, the Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you. This man is like a burning stick that has been snatched from the fire."<br>
3 Jeshua's clothing was filthy as he stood there before the angel.<br>
4 So the angel said to the others standing there, "Take off his filthy clothes." And turning to Jeshua he said, "See, I have taken away your sins, and now I am giving you these fine new clothes."<br>
5 Then I said, "They should also place a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean priestly turban on his head and dressed him in new clothes whilst the angel of the Lord stood by.<br>
6 Then the angel of the Lord spoke very solemnly to Jeshua and said,<br>
7 "This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: If you follow my ways and carefully serve me, then you will be given authority over my Temple and its courtyards. I will let you walk amongst these others standing here.<br>
8 "Listen to me, O Jeshua the high priest, and all you other priests. You are symbols of things to come. Soon I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
9 Now look at the jewel I have set before Jeshua, a single stone with seven facets, (a single stone with seven eyes). I will engrave an inscription on it, says the Lord of Heaven's Armies, and I will remove the sins of this land in a single day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
10 "And on that day, says the Lord of Heaven's Armies, each of you will invite your neighbour to sit with you peacefully under your own grapevine and fig tree."<br>
1 Then the angel who had been talking with me returned and woke me, as though I had been asleep.<br>
2<br>
"What do you see now?" he asked.<br>
I answered, "I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl of oil on top of it. Around the bowl are seven lamps, each having seven spouts with wicks.<br>
3 And I see two olive trees, one on each side of the bowl."<br>
4 Then I asked the angel, "What are these, my lord? What do they mean?"<br>
5 "Don't you know?" the angel asked.<br>
"No, my lord," I replied.<br>
6 Then he said to me, "This is what the Lord says to Zerubbabel: It is not by force nor by strength, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
<br>
<br>
7 Nothing, not even a mighty mountain, will stand in Zerubbabel's way; it will become a level plain before him! And when Zerubbabel sets the final stone of the Temple in place, the people will shout: 'May God bless it! May God bless it! (Grace, grace to it).'"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8 Then another message came to me from the Lord:<br>
9 "Zerubbabel is the one who laid the foundation of this Temple, and he will complete it. Then you will know that the Lord of Heaven's Armies has sent me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
10 Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin, to see the plumb line in Zerubbabel's hand."<br>
(The seven lamps (The seven facets, These seven,) represent the eyes of the Lord that search all around the world.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11 Then I asked the angel, "What are these two olive trees on each side of the lampstand,<br>
12 and what are the two olive branches that pour out golden oil through two gold tubes?"<br>
13<br>
"Don't you know?" he asked.<br>
"No, my lord," I replied.<br>
<br>
<br>
14<br>
Then he said to me, "They represent the two anointed ones (two heavenly beings, two sons of fresh oil,) who stand in the court of the Lord of all the earth."<br>
<br>
<br>
1<br>
I looked up again and saw a scroll flying through the air.<br>
2<br>
"What do you see?" the angel asked.<br>
"I see a flying scroll," I replied. "It appears to be about 30 feet long and 15 feet wide.<br>
"It appears to be about 20 cubits, or, 9.2 metres long and 10 cubits, or 4.6 metres wide."<br>
<br>
<br>
3<br>
Then he said to me, "This scroll contains the curse that is going out over the entire land. One side of the scroll says that those who steal will be banished from the land; the other side says that those who swear falsely will be banished from the land.<br>
4 And this is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: I am sending this curse into the house of every thief and into the house of everyone who swears falsely using my name. And my curse will remain in that house and completely destroy it -- even its timbers and stones."<br>
<br>
<br>
That is where we stopped before, right here in Zechariah 5:4.<br>
Again, what we mentioned earlier was, we will just stay here in the NLT a bit longer, as we look at the additional content here in Zechariah chapters 5 and 6.<br>
Let's continue reading, starting where we left off, continuing with the next verse, going to verse 11.<br>
Zechariah 5:5-11 NLT<br>
<br>
5 Then the angel who was talking with me came forward and said, "Look up and see what's coming."<br>
<br>
<br>
6<br>
"What is it?" I asked.<br>
He replied, "It is a basket for measuring grain, and it's filled with the sins of everyone throughout the land."<br>
(He replied, "It is an ephah, which is 20 quarts or 22 litres, and it's filled with the appearance of everyone throughout the land.")<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7 Then the heavy lead cover was lifted off the basket, and there was a woman sitting inside it.<br>
8 The angel said, "The woman's name is Wickedness," and he pushed her back into the basket and closed the heavy lid again.<br>
9 Then I looked up and saw two women flying toward us, gliding on the wind. They had wings like a stork, and they picked up the basket and flew into the sky.<br>
10 "Where are they taking the basket?" I asked the angel.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11 He replied, "To the land of Babylonia, (also known as the land of Shinar,) where they will build a temple for the basket. And when the temple is ready, they will set the basket there on its pedestal."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And finally, we conclude our look today in the book of Zechariah,<br>
by reading a bit of Zechariah 6...<br>
Zechariah 6: 1-13 NLT<br>
1 Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two bronze mountains.<br>
2 The first chariot was pulled by red horses, the second by black horses,<br>
3 the third by white horses, and the fourth by powerful dappled-grey horses.<br>
4 "And what are these, my lord?" I asked the angel who was talking with me.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 The angel replied, "These are the four spirits (the four winds) of heaven who stand before the Lord of all the earth. They are going out to do his work.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6 The chariot with black horses is going north, (the chariot with white horses is going after them,) the chariot with white horses is going west, and the chariot with dappled-grey horses is going south."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7 The powerful horses were eager to set out to patrol the earth. And the Lord said, "Go and patrol the earth!" So they left at once on their patrol.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8 Then the Lord summoned me and said, "Look, those who went north have vented the anger of my Spirit (and have given my Spirit rest) there in the land of the north."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
9 Then I received another message from the Lord:<br>
10 "Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah will bring gifts of silver and gold from the Jews exiled in Babylon. As soon as they arrive, meet them at the home of Josiah son of Zephaniah.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11 Accept their gifts, and make a crown from the silver and gold. Then put the crown on the head of Jeshua (also known as Joshua,) son of Jehozadak, the high priest.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
12 Tell him, 'This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies says: Here is the man called the Branch. He will branch out from where he is and build the Temple of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
13 Yes, he will build the Temple of the Lord. Then he will receive royal honour and will rule as king from his throne. (There will be a priest by his throne.) He will also serve as priest from his throne, and there will be perfect harmony between his two roles.'<br>

Deuteronomy 14: 7 & 8 (KJV)<br>
7 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.<br>

5 The hyrax (the coney, or rock badger) chews the cud but does not have split hooves, so it is unclean.<br>
6 The hare chews the cud but does not have split hooves, so it is unclean.<br>

The National Health Service, or NHS, was created in the United Kingdom in 1948 as one of the major social reforms following the Second World War.<br>
The NHS provides health care and medical treatment for UK residents.<br>
<br>
On 18 February 2019, the NHS published this article that mentioned the ingredients in vaccines.<br>
The website is<br>
<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/vaccine-ingredients/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/vaccine-ingredients/</a><br>
<br>
The article is titled, Vaccine ingredients.<br>
<br>
Here are some selected quotations from this NHS article.<br>
<br>
Gelatine derived from pigs is used as a stabilising agent in some vaccines.<br>
<br>
Stabilisers are added to vaccines to help protect them from the effects of heat or freeze-drying, and also help maintain the shelf life of the vaccine.<br>
<br>
The only vaccines containing gelatine in the UK routine vaccination schedule are the shingles vaccine, the children's nasal flu vaccine and 1 of the 2 types of MMR vaccine.<br>
<br>
Human serum albumin is a substance from human blood. It's a protein used to stabilise a vaccine and maintain its quality during storage.<br>
<br>
The serum used in vaccines comes from screened blood donors, and the manufacturing process ensures that any risk of transmitting disease is eliminated.<br>
<br>
Human serum albumin is used as a stabiliser in a chickenpox vaccine called Varilix.<br>
<br>
<br>
The American Academy of Paediatrics (also known as the AAP) is headquartered in Itasca, Illinois. It maintains its Department of Federal Affairs office in Washington, the District of Columbia, which is the capital of the United States.<br>
The AAP is an American professional association of paediatricians.<br>
A paediatrician is a doctor who deals with children and their illnesses, specialising in the study, diagnosis and treatment of children's diseases.<br>
The AAP published an article on December 2003, titled, Addressing Parents' Concerns: Do Vaccines Contain Harmful Preservatives, Adjuvants, Additives, or Residuals?<br>
The article was written by Paul A. Offit, and, Rita K. Jew.<br>
<br>
Both of these authors worked in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
Paul A. Offit, worked at the Division of Infectious Diseases, and at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.<br>

<br>
In this article, it said the following...<br>
<br>
Human serum albumin (0.3 mg/dose) is contained in measles vaccine (Attenuvax; Merck and Co, West Point, PA); mumps vaccine (Mumpsvax; Merck and Co); rubella vaccine (Meruvax; Merck and Co); and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMRII; Merck and Co). Because human serum albumin is derived from human blood, there is a theoretical risk that it might contain infectious agents. However, the FDA requires that human serum albumin be derived from blood of screened donors.<br>

ABC News published this article titled, What Aborted Foetuses Have to Do With Vaccines<br>
It was reported by By Liz Neporent on 17 February 2015.<br>

<br>
Here are some selected statements quoted from this article.<br>
<br>
Some childhood vaccines, including the one against rubella -- which is part of the MMR vaccine given to millions of children worldwide for measles, mumps and rubella -- is cultured in "WI-38 human diploid lung fibroblasts," according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's fact sheet on the vaccine's ingredients.<br>
<br>
Merck, the vaccine's manufacturer, acknowledged that those cells were originally obtained from an electively aborted foetus.<br>
(The American spelling for foetus, is, fetus.)<br>
<br>
Other common vaccines, including those for chicken pox, hepatitis and rabies, are also propagated in cells originating from legally aborted human foetuses, according to the FDA.<br>
<br>
<br>
On 25 October 2018 the British Broadcasting Corporation, the BBC, published an article, titled,<br>
Pork gelatine use in NHS vaccines 'disappointing'<br>
It was reported by By Sarah Jenkins.  The article was found here...<br>
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45939514">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45939514</a><br>

Is Pork Bad for You? 4 Hidden Dangers of Pork<br>
Even if properly cooked, or even cooked until it is well done, even cooked pork meat can cause the following diseases,<br>
according to a June 2017 article by Denise Minger, from the Healthline Media website.<br>

This article talks about cooked pork meat being able to give people the following diseases:<br>
<br>
1. Hepatitis E<br>
"hepatitis E, (is) a virus that infects 20 million people each year and can lead to acute illness (fever, fatigue, jaundice, vomiting, joint pain and stomach pain), enlarged liver and sometimes liver failure and death."<br>
"In rare cases, hepatitis E infection can lead to myocarditis (an inflammatory heart disease), acute pancreatitis (painful inflammation of the pancreas)...."<br>
<br>
2. Multiple Sclerosis<br>
"a study of inhabitants of the Orkney and Shetland Islands of Scotland,...found only one dietary association with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) -- consumption of "potted head," a dish made from boiled pig's brain.<br>
<br>
3. Liver Cancer and Cirrhosis<br>
"For decades, pork consumption has faithfully echoed liver cancer and cirrhosis rates around the world."<br>
"pork remained independently associated with liver disease..."<br>
<br>
4. Yersinia Bacteria<br>
"In the USA alone, Yersinia causes 35 deaths and almost 117,000 cases of food poisoning each year. Its chief entry route for humans? Undercooked pork."<br>
"Victims of Yersinia poisoning face a 47-times higher risk of reactive arthritis, a type of inflammatory joint disease triggered by infection."<br>
"...The majority of pork products (69% of tested samples, according to a Consumer Reports analysis) are contaminated with Yersinia bacteria...."<br>

Mark 7:19 KJV<br>
19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?<br>
<br>
<br>
Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
Published 51 years before the King James Version.<br>
<br>
Mark 7:19 (GNV)<br>
19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught which is the purging of all meats? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The NIV, and other modern translations add an additional sentence at the end that says:<br>
In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.<br>
This additional sentence is not in the Geneva Bible, and it is not in the KJV. Why is it not in the KJV?<br>
It was most likely added in the year 1978, in the NIV.<br>
Other newer translations have also added it. It is in the NLT.<br>
It was not originally in the Bible, and it is wrong for the NIV and NLT to have this extra sentence added, because that sentence is not actually in the Bible.<br>
<br>
Because this extra sentence is not actually a verse in the Bible, it is not true.<br>
It is in direct opposition to other verses, and it is in direct opposition to what the Bible teaches.<br>
<br>
In 2014, at the Canadian Hills Church of the Nazarene, Lex Meyer provided this commentary about Mark 7:19...<br>
Here are some selected quoted parts from his commentary:<br>
<br>
Notice that the phrase "In saying this, Jesus declared all foods 'clean'" is not present in the King James Version. This is because it is a translator's note that was added by the translators of the NIV (and a few other modern translations). If you look at the Greek text, you will not find that phrase anywhere. It is not present in any of the Greek manuscripts, it is an addition that was made by the translators.<br>
<br>
This really bothers me, because so many people are being misled to think this is Scripture, when in fact it is simply a commentary by modern (1978) translators, but because it is inserted into the body of the text, instead of the footnotes, it gives the impression that it was actually part of the Scriptures. This is quite a deception, and unfortunately, many people have been misled by this addition.<br>
<br>
If you go by the Biblical definition of food, you will see that pig, shrimp, crab, and rabbit (amongst many other things) are all listed as unclean for food. This means they are not even considered to be food.<br>
<br>
Just because it is in our grocery store today does not mean it is considered to be food by Yahweh. This is why the phrase "Jesus declared all foods 'clean'" is so confusing to people today, because they see pork in the grocery store and on the menu at the restaurant, and so they think it is food. However, these same people would probably not consider rat, dog, vulture, bat, or skunk to be food. The reason for that is because of conditioning and habituation. We have been programmed to think certain things are food, when in reality they are not.<br>
<br>
the Pharisees claim that the disciples must wash their hands before eating bread. This is not a commandment from the Scriptures, it is a "tradition of the elders".<br>
<br>
He is telling the Pharisees that their hand washing ritual is not based on the Commandments...<br>
<br>
it is a rejection of the commandments.<br>
<br>
The entire context of Mark 7 is about eating bread with unwashed hands. Bread is already a clean food, and there is nothing we need to do to make it clean. There are no special rituals or prayers that must be said to purify our bread because it is clean by definition. For someone to teach and require that special rituals be done before eating actually borders on witchcraft, and Messiah called them out on it.<br>
<br>
So, we see that he is saying that food is not what makes you unclean, even if you eat it with unwashed hands because it just passes through your body. But, the things that come out of your heart is what makes you defiled. To the Pharisees, cleanliness is the result of special rituals, but according to the Messiah, cleanliness is about having a pure heart.<br>
<br>
So, did Messiah declare all foods to be clean?<br>
No, the translators of certain modern Bibles made that declaration.<br>
<br>
Did Messiah declare all animals to be food?<br>
No, that is an assumption based on faulty interpretation.<br>
<br>
Is it wrong to wash our hands before we eat?<br>
No, it is perfectly fine to wash your hands before you eat, but don't think that it is a magic ritual that will somehow make your food clean. All you are doing by washing your hands is getting the dirt and germs off.<br>
<br>
Those words were selected portions of a commentary by Lex Meyer in 2014.<br>

2 Corinthians 5:21 (KJV)<br>
For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Many of the newer translations have inserted a sentence that does not exist in the original Greek.<br>
This sentence is added after Mark 7:19. Jesus never said that He declared all foods 'clean'.<br>
That sentence never existed in the Bible. It was added by NIV translators in 1978, and it is not true.<br>
2 Corinthians 5:21 is true.<br>
2 Corinthians 5:21 is actually in the original Greek text. It tells us that Jesus knew no sin.<br>
If Jesus knew what ham, pork and bacon tasted like, then he would know sin, because the Bible teaches us that it is a sin to eat pork and pig meats.<br>
If Jesus actually knew sin, then he would no longer be the perfect sacrifice, and 2 Corinthians 5:21 would be lie, making the Bible not true.<br>

<br>
Let's begin by taking a look in the Strong's Hebrew Lexicon,<br>
and the Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions.<br>
<br>
The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Strong's Concordance, is a Bible concordance, an index of every word in the King James Version (KJV), constructed under the direction of James Strong, first published in 1890.<br>
<br>
Also mentioned previously, on Christian Essays 6, this second reference book, titled, A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,<br>
is more commonly known as the Brown-Driver-Briggs or BDB, which is based on the name of its three authors.<br>
The BDB is a standard reference for Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, first published in the year 1906.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Masculine Hebrew word for a fringe or tassel is pronounced,<br>
Gah-Deel<br>
in the sense of twisting, it means, twisted threads, tassels, festoons<br>
tassels (on clothes), festoons (on capitals of columns)<br>
Again, this Masculine Hebrew word for a fringe or tassel is pronounced, Gah-Deel<br>
Be careful! The origin of the Masculine Hebrew word for, Gah-Deel, is pronounced, Gah-Dell.<br>
<br>
Gah-Dell sounds like a good thing, but it can also lead to something selfish and evil.<br>
Gah-Dell means,<br>
to grow, become great or important, promote, make powerful, praise, magnify, do great things<br>
<br>
to grow up<br>
to become great<br>
to be magnified<br>
to cause to grow<br>
to make great, powerful<br>
to magnify<br>
to be brought up<br>
to make great<br>
to do great things<br>
<br>
But watch out! Be careful! Gah-Dell can also mean,<br>
to magnify oneself<br>
to be (causatively make) large in pride,<br>
to be proudly (spoken), tower.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Wearing fringes or tassels can be a good, healthy way to help you grow up, and remember to be holy and obey the Commandments.<br>
Wearing fringes or tassels is not a way to show off and puff yourself up.<br>
Jesus called those religious show-offs, Hypocrites! He told them that they were fools and blind guides, in Matthew 23:16-19.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 23:5 (NLT) -- Here in Matthew 23, Jesus Criticises the Religious Leaders,<br>
Jesus was talking to the crowds and to his disciples about The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees.  In the NLT, at verse 5, Jesus says,<br>
Everything they do is for show. On their arms they wear extra wide prayer boxes with Scripture verses inside, and they wear robes with extra long tassels.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, the Masculine Hebrew word for a fringe or tassel is pronounced, Gah-Deel, which originates from Gah-Dell.<br>
In other places, we also see the Feminine Hebrew word for a fringe or tassel, which is pronounced,<br>
Seat-Sith, or, Seats, or, Sit-Seen<br>
<br>
That is the way it was said in the ancient Hebrew language.<br>
In the Hebrew language today, the feminine word may be pronounced, Seat-Seats.<br>
<br>
The masculine word is used in Deuteronomy 22:12,<br>
and the feminine word is used in Numbers 15:39.<br>
<br>
<br>
in the Strong's Hebrew Lexicon,<br>
and the Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions, it says that a Seat-Sith is<br>
a floral or wing like projection, that is, a fore lock of hair, a tassel<br>
a fringe, tassel, lock (as in, for example, a lock of hair)<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22:12 (KJV) -- has the masculine word, Gah-Deel<br>
(Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four wings of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.)<br>
12 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 22:12 NLT -- has the masculine word,  Gah-Deel<br>
11 "You must not wear clothing made of wool and linen woven together.<br>
12 "You must put four tassels on the hem of the cloak with which you cover yourself -- on the front, back, and sides.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 15:37-41 (KJV) -- has the feminine word, Seat-Sith in verse 39<br>
37 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
38 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:<br>
39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:<br>
40 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.<br>
41 I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 15:37-41 (NLT) -- has the feminine word, Seat-Sith in verse 39<br>
37 Then the Lord said to Moses,<br>
38 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel: Throughout the generations to come you must make tassels for the hems of your clothing and attach them with a blue cord.<br>
39 When you see the tassels, you will remember and obey all the commands of the Lord instead of following your own desires and defiling yourselves, as you are prone to do.<br>
40 The tassels will help you remember that you must obey all my commands and be holy to your God.<br>
41 I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt that I might be your God. I am the Lord your God!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Earlier, we mentioned Matthew 23.<br>
Let's look at some of it here again.<br>
<br>
Matthew 23:1-13 KJV<br>
1 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,<br>
2 Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:<br>
3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.<br>
4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.<br>
5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,<br>
6 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,<br>
7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.<br>
8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.<br>
9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.<br>
10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.<br>
11 But he that is greatest amongst you shall be your servant.<br>
12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.<br>
13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.<br>
<br>
Again, thinking about verse 5.<br>
Matthew 23:5 (NLT) -- Here in Matthew 23, Jesus Criticises the Religious Leaders,<br>
Jesus was talking to the crowds and to his disciples about The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees.  In the NLT, at verse 5, Jesus says,<br>
Everything they do is for show. On their arms they wear extra wide prayer boxes with Scripture verses inside, and they wear robes with extra long tassels.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 23:1-14 (NLT)<br>
1 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,<br>
<br>
<br>
2 "The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees are the official interpreters of the law of Moses.<br>
("The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses.)<br>
<br>
3 So practice and obey whatever they tell you, but don't follow their example. For they don't practice what they teach.<br>
4 They crush people with unbearable religious demands and never lift a finger to ease the burden.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 "Everything they do is for show. On their arms they wear extra wide prayer boxes with Scripture verses inside, and they wear robes with extra long tassels.<br>
("Everything they do is for show. They enlarge their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels.)<br>
<br>
6 And they love to sit at the head table at banquets and in the seats of honour in the synagogues.<br>
<br>
<br>
7 They love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi.'<br>
(Rabbi, is an Aramaic word that means "master" or "teacher.")<br>
<br>
8 "Don't let anyone call you 'Rabbi,' for you have only one teacher, and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters.<br>
9 And don't address anyone here on earth as 'Father,' for only God in heaven is your Father.<br>
10 And don't let anyone call you 'Teacher,' for you have only one teacher, the Messiah.<br>
11 The greatest amongst you must be a servant.<br>
12 But those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.<br>
13 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you shut the door of the Kingdom of Heaven in people's faces. You won't go in yourselves, and you don't let others enter either.<br>
14 What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! You shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, you will be severely punished.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definition<br>
of ephod.  An ephod is a...<br>
priestly garment, shoulder-cape or mantle, outer garment<br>
1. worn by an ordinary priest and made of white materials<br>
2. worn by the high priest - more costly, woven of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and linen threads provided with shoulder-pieces and a breast piece of like material, ornamented with gems and gold<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 28 gives the instructions on how to make the<br>
Clothing for the Priests<br>
and it also describes the<br>
Design of the Ephod, and the Design of the Chestpiece.<br>
When we get down to verse 31, it talks about Additional Clothing for the Priests...<br>
Exodus 28:33 (KJV)<br>
And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:<br>
<br>
Exodus 28:31-35 KJV<br>
31 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.<br>
32 And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.<br>
<br>
33 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem (the skirts) thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:<br>
<br>
34 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.<br>
35 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the Lord, and when he cometh out, that he die not.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the NLT, when we talk about a woven collar, the meaning of that Hebrew word is uncertain.<br>
<br>
NLT<br>
31 "Make the robe that is worn with the ephod from a single piece of blue cloth,<br>
<br>
32 with an opening for Aaron's head in the middle of it. Reinforce the opening with a woven collar so it will not tear.<br>
<br>
33 Make pomegranates out of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and attach them to the hem of the robe, with gold bells between them.<br>
34 The gold bells and pomegranates are to alternate all around the hem.<br>
35 Aaron will wear this robe whenever he ministers before the Lord, and the bells will tinkle as he goes in and out of the Lord's presence in the Holy Place. If he wears it, he will not die.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 28 is where they are told how to make it, and in chapter 39, it documents them actually making these things.<br>
So, in Exodus, chapter 39, it talks about them making the Clothing for the Priests, Making the Ephod, Making the Chestpiece<br>
and it documents them actually making the Additional Clothing for the Priests...<br>
Exodus, chapter 39, verses 24 through 26, KJV<br>
24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.<br>
25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;<br>
26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the Lord commanded Moses.<br>
<br>
Exodus, chapter 39, verses 24 through 26, NLT<br>
24 They made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and attached them to the hem of the robe.<br>
25 They also made bells of pure gold and placed them between the pomegranates along the hem of the robe,<br>
26 with bells and pomegranates alternating all around the hem. This robe was to be worn whenever the priest ministered before the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, we will be focusing on a story about a woman touching the hem or fringe of a garment.<br>
The story is told by Matthew, Mark and Luke.<br>
<br>
Matthew 9: 18-26 (KJV)<br>
18 Whilst he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.<br>
19 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.<br>
20 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:<br>
21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.<br>
22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.<br>
23 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,<br>
24 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.<br>
25 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.<br>
26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 9: 18-26 NLT<br>
18 As Jesus was saying this, the leader of a synagogue came and knelt before him. "My daughter has just died," he said, "but you can bring her back to life again if you just come and lay your hand on her."<br>
19 So Jesus and his disciples got up and went with him.<br>
20 Just then a woman who had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding came up behind him. She touched the fringe of his robe,<br>
21 for she thought, "If I can just touch his robe, I will be healed."<br>
22 Jesus turned around, and when he saw her he said, "Daughter, be encouraged! Your faith has made you well." And the woman was healed at that moment.<br>
23 When Jesus arrived at the official's home, he saw the noisy crowd and heard the funeral music.<br>
24 "Get out!" he told them. "The girl isn't dead; she's only asleep." But the crowd laughed at him.<br>
25 After the crowd was put outside, however, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she stood up!<br>
26 The report of this miracle swept through the entire countryside.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 5:22-43, the end of chapter 5, and we stop reading at verse 1 of the next chapter. (KJV)<br>
22 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,<br>
23 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.<br>
24 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.<br>
25 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,<br>
26 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,<br>
27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.<br>
28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.<br>
29 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.<br>
30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?<br>
31 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?<br>
32 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.<br>
33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.<br>
34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.<br>
35 Whilst he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?<br>
36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.<br>
37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.<br>
38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.<br>
39 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.<br>
40 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.<br>
41 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.<br>
42 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.<br>
43 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.<br>
1 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 5:22-43, the end of chapter 5, and we stop reading at verse 1 of the next chapter.<br>
NLT<br>
22 Then a leader of the local synagogue, whose name was Jairus, arrived. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet,<br>
23 pleading fervently with him. "My little daughter is dying," he said. "Please come and lay your hands on her; heal her so she can live."<br>
24 Jesus went with him, and all the people followed, crowding around him.<br>
25 A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding.<br>
26 She had suffered a great deal from many doctors, and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them, but she had gotten no better. In fact, she had gotten worse.<br>
27 She had heard about Jesus, so she came up behind him through the crowd and touched his robe.<br>
28 For she thought to herself, "If I can just touch his robe, I will be healed."<br>
29 Immediately the bleeding stopped, and she could feel in her body that she had been healed of her terrible condition.<br>
30 Jesus realised at once that healing power had gone out from him, so he turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my robe?"<br>
31 His disciples said to him, "Look at this crowd pressing around you. How can you ask, 'Who touched me?'"<br>
32 But he kept on looking around to see who had done it.<br>
33 Then the frightened woman, trembling at the realisation of what had happened to her, came and fell to her knees in front of him and told him what she had done.<br>
34 And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace. Your suffering is over."<br>
35 Whilst he was still speaking to her, messengers arrived from the home of Jairus, the leader of the synagogue. They told him, "Your daughter is dead. There's no use troubling the Teacher now."<br>
36 But Jesus overheard them (Jesus ignored them) and said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid. Just have faith."<br>
37 Then Jesus stopped the crowd and wouldn't let anyone go with him except Peter, James, and John (the brother of James).<br>
38 When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw much commotion and weeping and wailing.<br>
39 He went inside and asked, "Why all this commotion and weeping? The child isn't dead; she's only asleep."<br>
40 The crowd laughed at him. But he made them all leave, and he took the girl's father and mother and his three disciples into the room where the girl was lying.<br>
41 Holding her hand, he said to her, "Talitha koum," which means "Little girl, get up!"<br>
42 And the girl, who was twelve years old, immediately stood up and walked around! They were overwhelmed and totally amazed.<br>
43 Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened, and then he told them to give her something to eat.<br>
1 Jesus left that part of the country and returned with his disciples to Nazareth, his hometown.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 8:41-56, the end of chapter 8, and we will stop at verse 2 of chapter 9 (KJV)<br>
41 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:<br>
42 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.<br>
43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,<br>
44 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.<br>
45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?<br>
46 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.<br>
47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.<br>
48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.<br>
49 Whilst he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.<br>
50 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.<br>
51 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.<br>
52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.<br>
53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.<br>
54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.<br>
55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.<br>
56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.<br>
1 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.<br>
2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 8:41-56, all the way to the end of chapter 8, stopping at the end of chapter 8, verse 56.<br>
NLT<br>
41 Then a man named Jairus, a leader of the local synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come home with him.<br>
42 His only daughter, (His only child, a daughter,) who was about twelve years old, was dying.<br>
As Jesus went with him, he was surrounded by the crowds.<br>
<br>
43 A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding, (having spent everything she had on doctors,) and she could find no cure.<br>
<br>
<br>
44<br>
Coming up behind Jesus, she touched the fringe of his robe. Immediately, the bleeding stopped.<br>
45<br>
"Who touched me?" Jesus asked.<br>
Everyone denied it, and Peter said, "Master, this whole crowd is pressing up against you."<br>
46 But Jesus said, "Someone deliberately touched me, for I felt healing power go out from me."<br>
47 When the woman realised that she could not stay hidden, she began to tremble and fell to her knees in front of him. The whole crowd heard her explain why she had touched him and that she had been immediately healed.<br>
48 "Daughter," he said to her, "your faith has made you well. Go in peace."<br>
49 Whilst he was still speaking to her, a messenger arrived from the home of Jairus, the leader of the synagogue. He told him, "Your daughter is dead. There's no use troubling the Teacher now."<br>
50 But when Jesus heard what had happened, he said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid. Just have faith, and she will be healed."<br>
51 When they arrived at the house, Jesus wouldn't let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the little girl's father and mother.<br>
52 The house was filled with people weeping and wailing, but he said, "Stop the weeping! She isn't dead; she's only asleep."<br>
53 But the crowd laughed at him because they all knew she had died.<br>
54 Then Jesus took her by the hand and said in a loud voice, "My child, get up!"<br>
55 And at that moment her life (her spirit) returned, and she immediately stood up! Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.<br>
56 Her parents were overwhelmed, but Jesus insisted that they not tell anyone what had happened.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the book of Matthew 14, right after we read about how Jesus Feeds Five Thousand, and how Jesus Walks on Water, it says this...<br>
<br>
Matthew 14:34-36 (KJV)<br>
34 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.<br>
35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;<br>
36 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.<br>
<br>
Matthew 14:34-36 NLT<br>
34 After they had crossed the lake, they landed at Gennesaret.<br>
35 When the people recognised Jesus, the news of his arrival spread quickly throughout the whole area, and soon people were bringing all their sick to be healed.<br>
36 They begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe, and all who touched him were healed.<br>

There are many treasures of Scripture all jam-packed into the book of Isaiah. There is a nice concentration of these treasures in Isaiah chapters 54, 55 and 56.<br>
<br>
Let's read right now from the book of Isaiah, chapter 54, chapter 55 and a little bit of chapter 56, all in one continual reading.<br>
We will start in the book of Isaiah 54:13 and we will keep on reading the rest of chapter 54, and we keep reading right on into all of chapter 55, continuing to read until we get to Isaiah 56:8.<br>
<br>
KJV<br>
13 And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.<br>
14 In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.<br>
15 Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.<br>
16 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.<br>
17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgement thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.<br>
1 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Wherefore (do ye weigh money,) do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.<br>
<br>
<br>
3 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.<br>
4 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.<br>
5 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.<br>
6 Seek ye the Lord whilst he may be found, call ye upon him whilst he is near:<br>
<br>
<br>
7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br>
(Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will multiply to pardon.)<br>
<br>
<br>
8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.<br>
9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.<br>
10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:<br>
11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.<br>
12 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.<br>
13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Thus saith the Lord, (Keep ye equity,) Keep ye judgement, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.<br>
3 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the Lord, speak, saying, The Lord hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.<br>
4 For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;<br>
5 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.<br>
6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;<br>
7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.<br>
<br>
8 The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.<br>
(The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, to his gathered.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Again we read, this time in the NLT, from the book of Isaiah, chapter 54, chapter 55 and a little bit of chapter 56, all in one continual reading.<br>
We start again at Isaiah 54:13 and we keep on reading right on into all of chapter 55, all of the 13 verses in there, and we continue to read until we get to Isaiah 56:8.<br>
NLT<br>
13<br>
I will teach all your children,<br>
and they will enjoy great peace.<br>
14<br>
You will be secure under a government that is just and fair.<br>
Your enemies will stay far away.<br>
You will live in peace,<br>
and terror will not come near.<br>
15<br>
If any nation comes to fight you,<br>
it is not because I sent them.<br>
Whoever attacks you will go down in defeat.<br>
16<br>
"I have created the blacksmith<br>
who fans the coals beneath the forge<br>
and makes the weapons of destruction.<br>
And I have created the armies that destroy.<br>
17<br>
But in that coming day<br>
no weapon turned against you will succeed.<br>
You will silence every voice<br>
raised up to accuse you.<br>
These benefits are enjoyed by the servants of the Lord;<br>
their vindication will come from me.<br>
I, the Lord, have spoken!<br>
1<br>
"Is anyone thirsty?<br>
Come and drink -- <br>
even if you have no money!<br>
Come, take your choice of wine or milk -- <br>
it's all free!<br>
2<br>
Why spend your money on food that does not give you strength?<br>
Why pay for food that does you no good?<br>
Listen to me, and you will eat what is good.<br>
You will enjoy the finest food.<br>
3<br>
"Come to me with your ears wide open.<br>
Listen, and you will find life.<br>
I will make an everlasting covenant with you.<br>
I will give you all the unfailing love I promised to David.<br>
4<br>
See how I used him to display my power amongst the peoples.<br>
I made him a leader amongst the nations.<br>
5<br>
You also will command nations you do not know,<br>
and peoples unknown to you will come running to obey,<br>
because I, the Lord your God,<br>
the Holy One of Israel, have made you glorious."<br>
6<br>
Seek the Lord whilst you can find him.<br>
Call on him now whilst he is near.<br>
7<br>
Let the wicked change their ways<br>
and banish the very thought of doing wrong.<br>
Let them turn to the Lord that he may have mercy on them.<br>
Yes, turn to our God, for he will forgive generously.<br>
8<br>
"My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts," says the Lord.<br>
"And my ways are far beyond anything you could imagine.<br>
9<br>
For just as the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>
so my ways are higher than your ways<br>
and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.<br>
10<br>
"The rain and snow come down from the heavens<br>
and stay on the ground to water the earth.<br>
They cause the grain to grow,<br>
producing seed for the farmer<br>
and bread for the hungry.<br>
11<br>
It is the same with my word.<br>
I send it out, and it always produces fruit.<br>
It will accomplish all I want it to,<br>
and it will prosper everywhere I send it.<br>
12<br>
You will live in joy and peace.<br>
The mountains and hills will burst into song,<br>
and the trees of the field will clap their hands!<br>
13<br>
Where once there were thorns, cypress trees will grow.<br>
Where nettles grew, myrtles will sprout up.<br>
These events will bring great honour to the Lord's name;<br>
they will be an everlasting sign of his power and love."<br>
1<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Be just and fair to all.<br>
Do what is right and good,<br>
for I am coming soon to rescue you<br>
and to display my righteousness amongst you.<br>
2<br>
Blessed are all those<br>
who are careful to do this.<br>
Blessed are those who honour my Sabbath days of rest<br>
and keep themselves from doing wrong.<br>
3<br>
"Don't let foreigners who commit themselves to the Lord say,<br>
'The Lord will never let me be part of his people.'<br>
And don't let the eunuchs say,<br>
'I'm a dried-up tree with no children and no future.'<br>
4<br>
For this is what the Lord says:<br>
I will bless those eunuchs<br>
who keep my Sabbath days holy<br>
and who choose to do what pleases me<br>
and commit their lives to me.<br>
5<br>
I will give them -- within the walls of my house --<br>
a memorial and a name<br>
far greater than sons and daughters could give.<br>
For the name I give them is an everlasting one.<br>
It will never disappear!<br>
6<br>
"I will also bless the foreigners who commit themselves to the Lord,<br>
who serve him and love his name,<br>
who worship him and do not desecrate the Sabbath day of rest,<br>
and who hold fast to my covenant.<br>
7<br>
I will bring them to my holy mountain of Jerusalem<br>
and will fill them with joy in my house of prayer.<br>
I will accept their burnt offerings and sacrifices,<br>
because my Temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations.<br>
8<br>
For the Sovereign Lord,<br>
who brings back the outcasts of Israel, says:<br>
I will bring others, too,<br>
besides my people Israel."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17:21 (KJV)<br>
Thus saith the Lord; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17:24 (KJV)<br>
And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the Lord, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17: 21-25 NLT<br>
21 This is what the Lord says: Listen to my warning! Stop carrying on your trade at Jerusalem's gates on the Sabbath day.<br>
22 Do not do your work on the Sabbath, but make it a holy day. I gave this command to your ancestors,<br>
23 but they did not listen or obey. They stubbornly refused to pay attention or accept my discipline.<br>
24 "'But if you obey me, says the Lord, and do not carry on your trade at the gates or work on the Sabbath day, and if you keep it holy,<br>
25 then kings and their officials will go in and out of these gates forever. There will always be a descendant of David sitting on the throne here in Jerusalem. Kings and their officials will always ride in and out amongst the people of Judah in chariots and on horses, and this city will remain forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 13:19 (KJV)<br>
And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 13: 16-21 NLT<br>
16 Some men from Tyre, who lived in Jerusalem, were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise. They were selling it on the Sabbath to the people of Judah—and in Jerusalem at that!<br>
17 So I confronted the nobles of Judah. "Why are you profaning the Sabbath in this evil way?" I asked.<br>
18 "Wasn't it just this sort of thing that your ancestors did that caused our God to bring all this trouble upon us and our city? Now you are bringing even more wrath upon Israel by permitting the Sabbath to be desecrated in this way!"<br>
19 Then I commanded that the gates of Jerusalem should be shut as darkness fell every Friday evening (on the day before the Sabbath,) not to be opened until the Sabbath ended. I sent some of my own servants to guard the gates so that no merchandise could be brought in on the Sabbath day.<br>
20 The merchants and tradesmen with a variety of wares camped outside Jerusalem once or twice.<br>
21 But I spoke sharply to them and said, "What are you doing out here, camping around the wall? If you do this again, I will arrest you!" And that was the last time they came on the Sabbath.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 20:20 (KJV)<br>
And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 20: 19 & 20 NLT<br>
19 'I am the Lord your God,' I told them. 'Follow my decrees, pay attention to my regulations,<br>
20 and keep my Sabbath days holy, for they are a sign to remind you that I am the Lord your God.'<br>

Let's read all of Psalms 42.<br>
It has 11 verses total.<br>
KJV<br>
To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.<br>
(To the chief Musician, a Psalm giving instruction of the sons of Korah.)<br>
1 (As the hart brayeth after the water brooks,) As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.<br>
2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?<br>
3 My tears have been my meat day and night, whilst they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?<br>
4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.<br>
(Why art thou bowed down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet give thanks, for his presence is salvation.)<br>
<br>
6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the (little) hill Mizar.<br>
<br>
<br>
7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.<br>
8 Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.<br>
9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?<br>
<br>
<br>
10 (As with a killing in my bones,) As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; whilst they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?<br>
<br>
<br>
11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.<br>

All of Psalms 42, NLT.<br>
Psalms 42 is the beginning of Book Two (Psalms 42–72)<br>
For the choir director: A psalm of the descendants of Korah.<br>
(A maskil of the descendants of Korah. The Hebrew word, maskil, may be a literary or musical term.)<br>
1<br>
As the deer longs for streams of water,<br>
so I long for you, O God.<br>
2<br>
I thirst for God, the living God.<br>
When can I go and stand before him?<br>
3<br>
Day and night I have only tears for food,<br>
whilst my enemies continually taunt me, saying,<br>
"Where is this God of yours?"<br>
4<br>
My heart is breaking<br>
as I remember how it used to be:<br>
I walked amongst the crowds of worshippers,<br>
leading a great procession to the house of God,<br>
singing for joy and giving thanks<br>
amid the sound of a great celebration!<br>
5<br>
Why am I discouraged?<br>
Why is my heart so sad?<br>
I will put my hope in God!<br>
I will praise him again -- <br>
my Saviour and<br>
6<br>
my God!<br>
Now I am deeply discouraged,<br>
but I will remember you -- <br>
even from distant Mount Hermon, the source of the Jordan,<br>
from the land of Mount Mizar.<br>
7<br>
I hear the tumult of the raging seas<br>
as your waves and surging tides sweep over me.<br>
8<br>
But each day the Lord pours his unfailing love upon me,<br>
and through each night I sing his songs,<br>
praying to God who gives me life.<br>
9<br>
"O God my rock," I cry,<br>
"Why have you forgotten me?<br>
Why must I wander around in grief,<br>
oppressed by my enemies?"<br>
10<br>
Their taunts break my bones.<br>
They scoff, "Where is this God of yours?"<br>
11<br>
Why am I discouraged?<br>
Why is my heart so sad?<br>
I will put my hope in God!<br>
I will praise him again -- <br>
my Saviour and my God!<br>

<br>
<br>
You wrote a letter and You signed Your name<br>
I read every word of it page by page<br>
You said that You'd be coming<br>
Coming for me soon<br>
Lord My God I'll be ready for You<br>
<br>
'cause I want to run on greener pastures<br>
I want to dance on higher hills<br>
I want to drink from sweeter water<br>
In the misty morning chill<br>
And my soul is getting restless<br>
For the place where I belong<br>
I can't wait to join the angels and sing<br>
my heaven song<br>
<br>
<br>
I hear Your voice and I catch my breath<br>
'Well done my child, enter in and rest'<br>
Tears of joy roll down my cheek<br>
It's beautiful beyond my wildest dreams<br>
<br>
I want to run on greener pastures<br>
I want to dance on higher hills<br>
I want to drink from sweeter waters<br>
In the misty morning chill<br>
And my soul is getting restless<br>
For the place where I belong<br>
I can't wait to join the angels and sing<br>
<br>
I want to run on greener pasture<br>
I want to dance on higher hill<br>
I want to drink from sweeter water<br>

And my soul is getting restless<br>

I can't wait to join the angels and sing<br>
Oh I can't wait to join the angels and sing<br>
No I can't wait to join the angels and sing<br>
<br>
No I can't wait<br>
To see you shining in your light<br>
You'll be forever glorified<br>
<br>
No I can't Wait<br>
No I can't Wait<br>
To be forever by your side<br>
To be forever Glorified<br>
I'll be forever satisfied<br>
No I can't Wait<br>

<br>
No I can't wait to join the angels and sing<br>

Jude 1: 20-25<br>
KJV<br>
20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,<br>
21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.<br>
22 And of some have compassion, making a difference:<br>
23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.<br>
24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,<br>
25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jude 1: 20-25<br>
NLT<br>
20 But you, dear friends, must build each other up in your most holy faith, pray in the power of the Holy Spirit, (pray in the Holy Spirit,)<br>
<br>
21 and await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will bring you eternal life. In this way, you will keep yourselves safe in God's love.<br>
<br>
(And you must reprove those whose faith is wavering.)<br>
22 And you must show mercy to those whose faith is wavering.<br>
<br>
23 Rescue others by snatching them from the flames of judgement. Show mercy to still others, but do so with great caution, hating the sins that contaminate their lives.<br>
(Rescue others by snatching them from the flames of judgement. Show mercy to still others, those whose faith is wavering and therefore need to be snatched from the flames of judgement, and those who need to be shown mercy, but do so with great caution, hating the sins that contaminate their lives.)<br>
(Rescue others by snatching them from the flames of judgement. Show mercy to still others, but do so with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the flesh.)<br>
<br>
24 Now all glory to God, who is able to keep you from falling away and will bring you with great joy into his glorious presence without a single fault.<br>
25 All glory to him who alone is God, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord. All glory, majesty, power, and authority are his before all time, and in the present, and beyond all time! Amen.<br>

Commentary:<br>
This sentence is not in the Bible, but it was something interesting that I heard someone say in a dream...<br>
<br>
Behold the bridle of you that taught me so.<br>
<br>
Psalms 26:2 (KJV)<br>
Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; Try my reins and my heart.<br>
<br>
Psalms 73:21 (KJV)<br>
Thus my heart was grieved, And I was pricked in my reins.<br>
<br>
Psalms 139:13 (KJV)<br>
For thou hast possessed my reins: Thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 23:16 (KJV)<br>
Yea, my reins shall rejoice, When thy lips speak right things.<br>
<br>
Psalms 16:7 (KJV)<br>
I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: My reins also instruct me in the night seasons.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 11:20 (KJV)<br>
But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 20:12 (KJV)<br>
But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word that ended up being translated into the English word, reins, could actually be talking about<br>
kidneys -- this organ filters and separates the liquid waste out of the blood and sends it away as urine.<br>
The kidneys decide if it stays in as blood or gets sent out as urine.<br>
The blood gets pumped back into the heart again, and the urine does not; it gets sent out.<br>
The Hebrew word there for reins, can also be talking about the mind (as the interior self)<br>
and the seat of emotion and affection.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Maybe this means that he tests us to see if we let what is in our heart stay in there or if we let it go, and allow certain things of the heart to be cast out of us.<br>
What should we keep and treasure in our heart, and what should we let go of?<br>
<br>
Behold the bridle of you that taught me so.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the Bridle is the Heavenly Father and the Messiah, being the Good Shepherd, teaching us and directing us in the direction that we should go, in how we think and what we do and where we go, physically and spiritually.<br>
<br>
Then, the land does not possess us anymore.  We possess the land.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4:5 (KJV)<br>
Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgements, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4: 1-14 KJV<br>
1 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgements, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you.<br>
2 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.<br>
3 Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from amongst you.<br>
4 But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day.<br>
5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgements, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.<br>
6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.<br>
7 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?<br>
8 And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgements so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?<br>
9 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;<br>
10 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.<br>
<br>
11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; (and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven,) and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.<br>
12 And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire:<br>
(ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; save a voice.)<br>
ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.<br>
<br>
13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.<br>
14 And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgements, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 4: 1-14 NLT<br>
1 "And now, Israel, listen carefully to these decrees and regulations that I am about to teach you. Obey them so that you may live, so you may enter and occupy the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.<br>
2 Do not add to or subtract from these commands I am giving you. Just obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you.<br>
3 "You saw for yourself what the Lord did to you at Baal-peor. There the Lord your God destroyed everyone who had worshiped Baal, the god of Peor.<br>
4 But all of you who were faithful to the Lord your God are still alive today -- every one of you.<br>
5 "Look, I now teach you these decrees and regulations just as the Lord my God commanded me, so that you may obey them in the land you are about to enter and occupy.<br>
6 Obey them completely, and you will display your wisdom and intelligence amongst the surrounding nations. When they hear all these decrees, they will exclaim, 'How wise and prudent are the people of this great nation!'<br>
7 For what great nation has a god as near to them as the Lord our God is near to us whenever we call on him?<br>
8 And what great nation has decrees and regulations as righteous and fair as this body of instructions that I am giving you today?<br>
9 "But watch out! Be careful never to forget what you yourself have seen. Do not let these memories escape from your mind as long as you live! And be sure to pass them on to your children and grandchildren.<br>
<br>
<br>
10 Never forget the day when you stood before the Lord your God at (Mount Horeb, which is another name for) Mount Sinai, where he told me, 'Summon the people before me, and I will personally instruct them. Then they will learn to fear me as long as they live, and they will teach their children to fear me also.'<br>
<br>
11 "You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, whilst flames from the mountain shot into the sky. The mountain was shrouded in black clouds and deep darkness.<br>
12 And the Lord spoke to you from the heart of the fire. You heard the sound of his words but didn't see his form; there was only a voice.<br>
<br>
13 He proclaimed his covenant -- the Ten Commandments (the ten words,) -- which he commanded you to keep, and which he wrote on two stone tablets.<br>
<br>
14 It was at that time that the Lord commanded me to teach you his decrees and regulations so you would obey them in the land you are about to enter and occupy.<br>

1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.<br>
3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.<br>
4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.<br>
<br>
Selah.<br>
<br>
5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.<br>
<br>
Selah.<br>
<br>
(For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time of finding: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.)<br>
<br>
6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.<br>
<br>
7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.<br>
<br>
Selah.<br>
<br>
(I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee, mine eye shall be upon thee)<br>
<br>
8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.<br>
10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.<br>
11 Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The NIV says that, Selah is a word of uncertain meaning, and is only mentioned in the footnotes in the NIV.<br>
The NIV mentions that Selah is at the end of verses 4, 5 and 7, but does not actually include it in the text.<br>
The NIV can be a fairly good translation to read, but the people that made the NIV did make some serious mistakes.<br>
One very serious mistake was the NIV team adding an additional verse after Mark 7:19 that does not exist in the Bible, and is in direct opposition to what the Bible teaches.<br>
We looked at that already in a previous Bible study.<br>
Another mistake is them removing Selah from the Bible and just giving it a small mention in the footnotes.<br>
Just because you don't clearly understand a Hebrew word does not make it less important, and does not give you the right to remove it or ignore it.<br>
Selah is used 74 times in the Bible. Although the meaning of the word is not clearly known, some ideas on what it could mean would include the following:<br>
Stop and listen.<br>
Pause, and think of that.<br>
Think about what was just read or sang, and give it some serious thought.<br>
It could be a form of underlining in preparation for the next paragraph.<br>
It could be used to emphasise the truth and importance of the preceding passage.<br>
In the NLT, the word, Selah, is translated into the English word, Interlude.<br>
An Interlude can be, in music, a short piece of music that is played before continuing to the next part or singing the next verse of the song.<br>
Another way of saying that would be, musically speaking, the regular song, or singing, stops and something else happens, musically, for a moment, before continuing with playing or singing the next part of the song.<br>
(Some parts from the Longman and Collins dictionaries were used to help me word that explanation of what an Interlude can be.)<br>
Just remember that, Interlude is an English translation of what Selah could mean from a musical perspective.<br>
Selah, from a perspective of studying the Bible, could mean, stop and think about what you have just read.<br>
Let's read the NIV of Psalms 32. They do an interesting English translation, even though they neglected to keep Selah in the Psalm.<br>
And then, after that, we will read it in the NLT, remembering that, Selah was translated into, Interlude, in the NLT.<br>

<br>
Of David. A maskil. (Probably a literary or musical term.)<br>
1<br>
Blessed is the one<br>
whose transgressions are forgiven,<br>
whose sins are covered.<br>
2<br>
Blessed is the one<br>
whose sin the Lord does not count against them<br>
and in whose spirit is no deceit.<br>
3<br>
When I kept silent,<br>
my bones wasted away<br>
through my groaning all day long.<br>
4<br>
For day and night<br>
your hand was heavy on me;<br>
my strength was sapped<br>
as in the heat of summer.<br>
<br>
<br>
5<br>
Then I acknowledged my sin to you<br>
and did not cover up my iniquity.<br>
I said, "I will confess<br>
my transgressions to the Lord."<br>
And you forgave<br>
the guilt of my sin.<br>
6<br>
Therefore let all the faithful pray to you<br>
whilst you may be found;<br>
surely the rising of the mighty waters<br>
will not reach them.<br>
7<br>
You are my hiding place;<br>
you will protect me from trouble<br>
and surround me with songs of deliverance.<br>
8<br>
I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;<br>
I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.<br>
9<br>
Do not be like the horse or the mule,<br>
which have no understanding<br>
but must be controlled by bit and bridle<br>
or they will not come to you.<br>
10<br>
Many are the woes of the wicked,<br>
but the Lord's unfailing love<br>
surrounds the one who trusts in him.<br>
11<br>
Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous;<br>
sing, all you who are upright in heart!<br>

<br>
Yes, what joy for those<br>
whose record the Lord has cleared of guilt,<br>

3<br>
When I refused to confess my sin,<br>
my body wasted away,<br>

4<br>
Day and night your hand of discipline was heavy on me.<br>
My strength evaporated like water in the summer heat.<br>
<br>

<br>
5<br>
Finally, I confessed all my sins to you<br>

I said to myself, "I will confess my rebellion to the Lord."<br>
And you forgave me! All my guilt is gone.<br>
<br>
Interlude<br>

6<br>
Therefore, let all the godly pray to you whilst there is still time,<br>
that they may not drown in the floodwaters of judgement.<br>

you protect me from trouble.<br>
You surround me with songs of victory.<br>

I will advise you and watch over you.<br>

Do not be like a senseless horse or mule<br>
that needs a bit and bridle to keep it under control."<br>
10<br>
Many sorrows come to the wicked,<br>
but unfailing love surrounds those who trust the Lord.<br>
11<br>
So rejoice in the Lord and be glad, all you who obey him!<br>
Shout for joy, all you whose hearts are pure!<br>

<a name="JAH10ENOCH69"></a><h2>Evil Knowledge</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Evil Knowledge<br>
<br>
It was the taking in of a mixed-up mixture of good and evil knowledge that caused sin to enter into us, pushing God away from us, separating us from God.<br>
The taking-in of the good and evil knowledge mixture is what poisons us with sin, and so Jesus is the antidote that takes away our sin.<br>
<br>
What is Evil Knowledge?<br>
<br>
Let's start with a quick review of this evil knowledge...<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:9 (KJV)<br>
And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:16 & 17 (KJV)<br>
16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden (eating thou shalt eat) thou mayest freely eat:<br>
17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof (dying thou shalt die) thou shalt surely die.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 3: 4-11 KJV<br>
4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:<br>
5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.<br>
6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, (and that it was a desire to the eyes,) and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.<br>
7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons (and made themselves things to gird about).<br>
8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden (in the wind of the day) in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.<br>
9 And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?<br>
10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.<br>
11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 3:22-24 (KJV)<br>
22 And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:<br>
23 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.<br>
24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<br>
<br>
Let's look at those verses again in the NLT.<br>
<br>
Genesis 2:9 (NLT)<br>
9 The Lord God made all sorts of trees grow up from the ground -- trees that were beautiful and that produced delicious fruit. In the middle of the garden he placed the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<br>
<br>
Genesis 2: 15 - 17 (NLT)<br>
15 The Lord God placed the man in the Garden of Eden to tend and watch over it. <br>
16 But the Lord God warned him, "You may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the garden --<br>
17 except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat its fruit, you are sure to die."<br>
<br>
Genesis 3: 4-11 -- NLT<br>
4 "You won't die!" the serpent replied to the woman.<br>
5 "God knows that your eyes will be opened as soon as you eat it, and you will be like God, knowing both good and evil."<br>
6 The woman was convinced. She saw that the tree was beautiful and its fruit looked delicious, and she wanted the wisdom it would give her. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too.<br>
7 At that moment their eyes were opened, and they suddenly felt shame at their nakedness. So they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.<br>
8 When the cool evening breezes were blowing, the man (Adam) and his wife heard the Lord God walking about in the garden. So they hid from the Lord God amongst the trees.<br>
9 Then the Lord God called to the man, "Where are you?"<br>
10 He replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, so I hid. I was afraid because I was naked."<br>
11 "Who told you that you were naked?" the Lord God asked. "Have you eaten from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat?"<br>
<br>
Genesis 3:22-24 (NLT)<br>
22 Then the Lord God said, "Look, the human beings have become like us, knowing both good and evil. What if they reach out, take fruit from the tree of life, and eat it? Then they will live forever!"<br>
23 So the Lord God banished them from the Garden of Eden, and he sent Adam out to cultivate the ground from which he had been made.<br>
24 After sending them out, the Lord God stationed mighty cherubim to the east of the Garden of Eden. And he placed a flaming sword that flashed back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 6: 1-9 KJV<br>
1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,<br>
2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.<br>
3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.<br>
4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.<br>
<br>
(And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that the whole imagination, the purposes and desires of his heart, was only evil every day.)<br>
<br>
5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.<br>
6 And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.<br>
7 And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; (from man unto beast,) both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.<br>
8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.<br>
and part of verse 9 says,<br>
9 ...Noah was a just man (upright) and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 6: 1-9 NLT<br>
1 Then the people began to multiply on the earth, and daughters were born to them.<br>
2 The sons of God saw the beautiful women and took any they wanted as their wives.<br>
3 Then the Lord said, "My Spirit will not put up with humans for such a long time, for they are only mortal flesh. In the future, their normal lifespan will be no more than 120 years."<br>
4 In those days, and for some time after, giant Nephilites lived on the earth, for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with women, they gave birth to children who became the heroes and famous warriors of ancient times.<br>
5 The Lord observed the extent of human wickedness on the earth, and he saw that everything they thought or imagined was consistently and totally evil.<br>
6 So the Lord was sorry he had ever made them and put them on the earth. It broke his heart.<br>
7 And the Lord said, "I will wipe this human race I have created from the face of the earth. Yes, and I will destroy every living thing -- all the people, the large animals, the small animals that scurry along the ground, and even the birds of the sky. I am sorry I ever made them."<br>
8 But Noah found favour with the Lord.<br>
and we end again here with part of verse 9 in the NLT...<br>
9 ...Noah was a righteous man, the only blameless person living on earth at the time, and he walked in close fellowship with God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: The Nephilites are just briefly mentioned here before we move on to the story of Noah. Why is it just barely mentioned?<br>
The Nephilites are also known as the Nephilim. The Anakites come from the Nephilim.<br>
They are thought of as the fallen ones, fallen angels, and their unnatural sexual intercourse with human women produced giants.<br>
The giants that the fallen angels made are the Nephilim.<br>
There is also an interesting area in the New Testament, in 2 Peter 2, that seems to also mention some kind of fallen angels or evil angels.<br>
Let's look at this area of 2 Peter 2.  We will just look at this in the NLT.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Peter 2: 1-13 -- NLT<br>
1 But there were also false prophets in Israel, just as there will be false teachers amongst you. They will cleverly teach destructive heresies and even deny the Master who bought them. In this way, they will bring sudden destruction on themselves.<br>
2 Many will follow their evil teaching and shameful immorality. And because of these teachers, the way of truth will be slandered.<br>
3 In their greed they will make up clever lies to get hold of your money. But God condemned them long ago, and their destruction will not be delayed.<br>
4 For God did not spare even the angels who sinned. He threw them into hell, in gloomy pits of darkness, where they are being held until the day of judgement.<br>
5 And God did not spare the ancient world -- except for Noah and the seven others in his family. Noah warned the world of God's righteous judgement. So God protected Noah when he destroyed the world of ungodly people with a vast flood.<br>
6 Later, God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and turned them into heaps of ashes. He made them an example of what will happen to ungodly people.<br>
7 But God also rescued Lot out of Sodom because he was a righteous man who was sick of the shameful immorality of the wicked people around him.<br>
8 Yes, Lot was a righteous man who was tormented in his soul by the wickedness he saw and heard day after day.<br>
9 So you see, the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials, even whilst keeping the wicked under punishment until the day of final judgement.<br>
10 He is especially hard on those who follow their own twisted sexual desire, and who despise authority. These people are proud and arrogant, daring even to scoff at supernatural beings without so much as trembling.<br>
11 But the angels, who are far greater in power and strength, do not dare to bring from the Lord a charge of blasphemy against those supernatural beings.<br>
12 These false teachers are like unthinking animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed. They scoff at things they do not understand, and like animals, they will be destroyed.<br>
13 Their destruction is their reward for the harm they have done. They love to indulge in evil pleasures in broad daylight. They are a disgrace and a stain amongst you. They delight in deception....<br>
<br>
Here in the NLT, look closely again at verses 10 and 11.<br>
<br>
2 Peter 2: verse 10 and 11 -- NLT<br>
10 He is especially hard on those who follow their own twisted sexual desire, and who despise authority. These people are proud and arrogant, daring even to scoff at supernatural beings without so much as trembling.<br>
11 But the angels, who are far greater in power and strength, do not dare to bring from the Lord a charge of blasphemy against those supernatural beings.<br>
<br>
What are supernatural beings?<br>
The Greek wording right here indicates that these supernatural beings are glorious ones, which are probably evil angels.<br>
<br>
Commentary: When Moses wrote the book of Genesis, he probably just briefly mentions the fallen angels and the giants because he did not need to go into detail about something that was already covered in the book of Enoch.<br>
The Book of Enoch, is known today as 1 Enoch.<br>
The other books, 2 Enoch and 3 Enoch are not considered to be true.  They seem to be fake books, filled with fictional mistakes.<br>
1 Enoch, however, appears to be the only true, original book of Enoch.<br>
Enoch was written before Moses wrote Genesis and the first five books that we have in our Bible.<br>
Many experts believe that the Book of Enoch used to be in our Bible, and Moses had the book of Enoch, which may be why he did not bother to go into detail on that which is already in the book of Enoch.<br>
There used to be many additional books in our Bible, perhaps as many as over 100 at one time, but they have been removed because people have been trying to destroy the truth, and the many clear references to Jesus Christ in books that used to be in the Old Testament.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enoch is the great-grandfather of Noah.<br>
<br>
The First book of Enoch is the only true book actually written by Enoch.<br>
We will refer to this here simply as the book of Enoch.<br>
What is evil knowledge?<br>
The book of Enoch tells us.  The fallen angels brought the evil knowledge to earth and gave this evil knowledge to humans.<br>
This part of Enoch is a surviving fragment of the Book of Noah.<br>
It is Enoch Chapter 68 or 69 (There is not a clear agreement on the chapter numbering.)<br>
In this area, the fallen angels are named along with the<br>
types of evil knowledge that they brought to the earth.<br>
<br>
Look carefully at this list of evil knowledge.<br>
Have you ever considered that this kind of knowledge listed here is actually evil knowledge?<br>
<br>
Think carefully now about this here, and how this is all considered to be evil knowledge.<br>
<br>
There may not be a clear agreement on how to spell or pronounce the names mentioned here.<br>
Some parts of this text may be damaged, partially lost or difficult to translate from the ancient Hebrew into English.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Leader is Yeqon or Jeqon<br>
He first tempted the other Watchers into having sexual relations with humans.<br>
<br>
<br>
The leader had four assistants.<br>
<br>
Assistant 1 of 4 --  Asbeel<br>
He helped to encourage the sexual relations with the human women.<br>
<br>
<br>
Assistant 2 of 4 --  is Gadreel -- taught the art of cosmetics, the use of weapons and killing blows.<br>
<br>
<br>
Assistant 3 of 4 --  is Penemue -- taught mankind the art of writing with ink and paper, and taught the children of men the bitter and the sweet and the secrets of wisdom.<br>
Interesting that, today we write with a pen, and the art of writing with ink and paper came from a fallen angel named Penemue?<br>
Is our pen named after this fallen angel?<br>
<br>
Assistant 4 of 4 --  is Kasdaye (or Kasadya)<br>
Kasdaye (or Kasadya) is also known as Tamiel (or Tumiel)<br>
This fourth assistant is the fifth fallen angel mentioned of the 20 watcher leaders of the 200 fallen angels in the Book of Enoch. Tamiel is also called Kasdaye or Kasdeja.<br>
<br>
Kasdaye taught the children of men all of the wicked strikes of spirits, the strikes of demons, and the strikes of the embryo in the womb so that it may pass away (knowledge about how to cause an abortion), and the strikes of the soul, the bites of the serpent, and the strikes which befall through the noontide heat, which is called the son of the serpent named Taba'et (meaning male).<br>
<br>
There are about 13 of these fallen angels that distributed evil knowledge.<br>
The book of Enoch mentions their names and what kind of knowledge each one of them distributed.<br>
<br>
To save us some time, let's just make one combined list of all of the evil knowledge and read it here.<br>
Unfortunately, the evil knowledge that came from Bezaliel (also known as Busasejal or Basasael) is not certain.<br>
The text that talks about this 13th Watcher of the 20 leaders of the 200 fallen angels listed in the Book of Enoch, is damaged and can't be clearly understood or translated.<br>
With this text not clearly included, this may suggest that the list we are about to read is not the complete, entire list.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is one combined list of all the evil knowledge from Enoch Chapter 68 or 69...<br>
the signs of the earth<br>
enchantments<br>
How to make knives, swords, shields, and how to devise ornaments and cosmetics.<br>
the art of cosmetics, the use of weapons and killing blows.<br>
astrology<br>
the signs of the clouds (meteorology)<br>
the art of writing with ink and paper<br>
the bitter and the sweet and the secrets of wisdom<br>
the courses of the moon<br>
the signs of the sun<br>
unnatural prostitution and breeding of giants, in order to dominate, murder, and exploit the inferior races of men<br>
the wicked strikes of spirits, the strikes of demons, and the strikes of the embryo in the womb so that it may pass away (how to cause an abortion), and the strikes of the soul, the bites of the serpent, and the strikes which befall through the noontide heat.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Yes, we have many commandments that point directly to this knowledge as evil. It was evil then, and it still is evil today.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is just one example that we looked at, back in Christian Essays 2...<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 18: 9-14 KJV<br>
9 When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.<br>
10 There shall not be found amongst you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,<br>
11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.<br>
12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee.<br>
13 Thou shalt be perfect (upright, sincere) with the Lord thy God.<br>
14 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, (which thou shalt inherit,) hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 18: 9-14 NLT:<br>
"When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, be very careful not to imitate the detestable customs of the nations living there.<br>
For example, never sacrifice your son or daughter as a burnt offering. (Never make your son or daughter pass through the fire.) And do not let your people practice fortune-telling, or use sorcery, or interpret omens, or engage in witchcraft, or cast spells, or function as mediums or psychics, or call forth the spirits of the dead.<br>
Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord. It is because the other nations have done these detestable things that the Lord your God will drive them out ahead of you.<br>
But you must be blameless before the Lord your God. The nations you are about to displace consult sorcerers and fortune-tellers, but the Lord your God forbids you to do such things."<br>
<br>
<br>
However, a good part of this knowledge that we have here, it may have originally been evil knowledge, but what Satan intended for evil, God can use it for good.<br>
May the Lord give us wisdom on the knowledge that we can use for good, and the knowledge that we need to stay away from.<br>
The Bible is the sword that helps us rightly divide this good and evil knowledge.<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 1:12-14 KJV<br>
12 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;<br>
13 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;<br>
14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 1:12-14 NLT<br>
12 And I want you to know, my dear brothers and sisters, that everything that has happened to me here has helped to spread the Good News.<br>
13 For everyone here, (including all the Praetorium,) including the whole palace guard, knows that I am in chains because of Christ.<br>
14 And because of my imprisonment, (most of the brothers in the Lord,) most of the believers here have gained confidence and boldly speak God's message without fear.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8:28 KJV<br>
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.<br>
<br>
Romans 8:28 NLT<br>
And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This last verse here is where Joseph Reassures His Brothers...<br>
<br>
Genesis 50:20 KJV<br>
But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 50:20 NLT<br>
You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people.<br>
