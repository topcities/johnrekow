<a name="JAH28BADTOUCH"></a><h2>Abuse</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 3:11 (KJV)<br>
And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?<br>
<br>
Genesis 3:11 (NLT)<br>
"Who told you that you were naked?" the Lord God asked. "Have you eaten from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Near the end of the previous chapter, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 27, officially known as Christian Essays 27, we had recently touched on and prayed about the difficult topic of child sexual abuse.<br>
With that in mind, we will now put together some notes that were extracted from and based on the content found on these two webpages...<br>
<br>
RFUT:&nbsp; Raising Children Network (Australia):&nbsp; Signs That Someone Is Involved In Child Sexual Abuse<br>
<a href="https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/safety/child-sexual-abuse/signs-that-someone-is-involved-in-child-sexual-abuse">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/safety/child-sexual-abuse/signs-that-someone-is-involved-in-child-sexual-abuse</a><br>
RFUT:&nbsp; Raising Children Network (Australia):&nbsp; Child Sexual Abuse -- What To Do If A Child Is Sexually Abused<br>
<a href="https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/safety/child-sexual-abuse/child-sexual-abuse-what-to-do">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/safety/child-sexual-abuse/child-sexual-abuse-what-to-do</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With some quotes and some paraphrased material from those two webpages, I feel that we should be on guard, and be looking out for<br>
Signs that someone is involved in child sexual abuse<br>
or the possible signs that someone might be wanting to sexually abuse children.<br>
Let's take a moment to think about this topic.<br>
<br>
This message is for children, for young children, for older children that are having to take care of or look after younger children, and parents, and families,<br>
and also other parents or adults who spend some time having to take care of or look after children.<br>
<br>
You should think about reading all of this message to your children and to your family.<br>
<br>
Preventing child sexual abuse starts with your family and community.<br>
If you suspect a child has experienced sexual abuse in your community, report your concerns to the police,<br>
In the UK, phone 999 -- In Australia, phone 000 -- In the USA, call 911.<br>
<br>
May the Holy Spirit show you the truth about the people and family members in your life.<br>
May the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, guard you and protect you from being the victim of someone else's sin.<br>
<br>
A person who may love or care about someone, may do these things...<br>
They try to build trusting relationships,<br>
they try to be very supportive and caring, with best interests at heart.<br>
Some people are just very curious or care a lot about your family and your child.<br>
Some people may want to show love, and support for helping with families and children.<br>
From a Christian perspective, this would also include helping to encourage families and children with their relationship with the Heavenly Father and His Son, our Saviour,<br>
and to encourage families and children to pray and read their Bible, and try our best to follow Him, and obey Him.<br>
Previously, in Christian Essays 27, we had a long List of Needs, because good people will pray for each other, and will try to help each other with their List of Needs,<br>
making sure that families and children have all of their needs met.<br>
See the Bible study that we have on the previous page, Christian Essays 27, titled, List of Needs.<br>
<br>
A good person may want to love and help, and help as well as they can, local families and children have all of their needs met.
A good person may care a lot about your family and your child.<br>
Unfortunately, an evil person, who wants to do child sexual abuse, will also pretend to do all of those same things.<br>
Is that child who is younger than you, a good person, or a bad person pretending to be good?<br>
Is that older child or adult, a good person, or a bad person pretending to be good?<br>
A good person and a bad person can do those good things, or pretend like they want to do, all of those good things that we were just talking about.<br>
<br>
Matthew 7:15 (NLT)<br>
"Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves.<br>
<br>
Not everyone who behaves in these ways should be kept away from your child.<br>
Some people are just very curious or care a lot about your family and your child.<br>
A good person may normally do or want to do all of those things that we just mentioned.<br>
<br>
But, there are some additional things that the bad person will try to do.<br>
A good person may do some of this, but a bad person may really, really try very hard to do the following things more and more...<br>
If you notice someone behaving in the following ways around your child or the child you're caring for, this might be cause for concern about child sexual abuse.<br>
<br>
The person that might be a bad person, maybe, who might want to sexually abuse children:<br>
Will try to be alone with your child to create the opportunity to do the abuse.<br>
The person persistently tries to spend time alone with your child -- for example, asks to babysit your child, or invites your child to stay overnight at their place or go camping with them.<br>
The person frequently separates your child from other adults or children and seeks 'special time' with them.<br>
The person is secretive and doesn't share information with you about how they've spent time with your child.<br>
The person tries to undermine your relationship with your child by doing things, like telling your child you're a bad parent.<br>
The person buys your child treats or gifts, which might become more frequent and more expensive.<br>
The person insists on kisses, hugs or other physical contact from your child  --  for example, frequent tickling games or other rough-and-tumble play that involves touching, or getting your child to sit on their lap.<br>
The person is unusually interested in your child's body or sexual development, or appearance, or compliments your child excessively.<br>
The person takes too many photos of your child, and friends your child on social media.<br>
<br>
Child sexual abuse is when someone, another child or an adult, tries to look at or touch the private areas of a child's body, for fun, but they end up hurting the child.<br>
Hurting a child's body for fun is wrong, and that is why Child sexual abuse is always a serious crime.<br>
They usually wait until they are alone with the child before trying to do those things.<br>
Then they say that they must keep it a secret, and that they are supposed to like it, and that it is supposed to feel good doing that.<br>
People who sexually abuse children need the abuse to be a secret.<br>
You should never keep secrets that don't feel right, and You should never keep secrets that are making you feel afraid or unsafe.<br>
Child sexual abuse is when adults or older children involve children in sexual activity.<br>
Child sexual abuse is never a child's fault.<br>
<br>
<br>
People who sexually abuse children are likely to be family members or people you know well.<br>
People who sexually abuse children often try to build trust with the child's family.<br>
They can be older adults, young adults, teenage kids, or even children younger than you that may try to sexually abuse another child or adult.<br>
They might be adults, young people or older children.<br>
They can be family or friends, from work, from school, living near you, from your church or fellowship, or they could be very far away, online, trying to send and receive the abusive content to and from your child.<br>
The difficult part, is that, People who sexually abuse children look and act like everyone else. They don't look, sound or dress in a particular way.<br>
<br>
Children who have been sexually abused,<br>
They might say that they liked the abuse, or act like they liked it, and that it made them feel good,<br>
They might talk about sex a lot and show behaviour in forms of verbal and non-verbal communication or gestures that could be interpreted as sexual.<br>
Abused children who try to sexually abuse other children will talk to the other child about sex, and their sexual experiences, and he or she may try to send or share or show the other child sexual or pornographic pictures or videos on their phone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Children who are not even yet teenagers may have been abused when they were very young.<br>
Toddlers and pre-schoolers may have been abused.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, even for very young children, after meeting them for the first time that same day, or after only knowing them for a short time, they may suddenly talk about past sexual experiences and sexual activities, and they may suddenly mimic or imitate some of those experiences in their behaviour. It may seem strange, especially if the child is 10 or 9 or 8 years old, or even younger, and they have a strong interest in something that is not appropriate for their age, when they have not yet started to develop and mature, sexually. They may have this strong interest because someone has been teaching them how to do things that they should not be doing.<br>
<br>
It's important for anyone who spends time or watches other children to be on the lookout for these signs. Children may be babysitting or child-minding other younger children someday, and when they grow up and become parents, it's still important, to continue to be watching out for these signs and indications. If not careful, these children who are not even yet in their teenage years may teach bad things to other children that may not be appropriate for their age. If you have feelings of concern or suspicion, do not let those children, that child, that teen, or that adult, suddenly run off and be alone with you or your child, or have a child be alone with another adult, even in another room in your home, not even for a minute.<br>
<br>
If it happened in the past, it is important to talk about it to make sure it stops and that the one doing the abuse is not trying to abuse other children.<br>
<br>
If it is happening with the child in his or her present time, it is important to talk about it, and come up with a plan on how to make the abuse stop, and figure out how to get the child away from the abuser and into a safer situation so that the child does not receive any more abuse.<br>
<br>
Even if there has been no abuse in the past, and even if there is no abuse going on right now, it is still important to talk about this topic and to be on the lookout for possible warning signs of someone that may be wanting to abuse children that you might meet in the future, as well as for when older kids become parents and need to be watching, both now and later on, in the future, for these warning signs in other people that may someday be around their child.<br>
<br>
It's important to talk about coming up with a plan on what to do if there was a fire in the house, or if there was a flood or earthquake, or some other disaster. For example, How to tell if there is a fire nearby. How to evacuate from this room or that room, and have a plan where we agree to all meet at a certain safe area. In the same way, it is also important  for a family to talk about having a plan on what to look out for and what to do if someone has been showing signs of being sexually abused, and what to look out for in a person that might be trying to sexually abuse other children, or even your own children someday.<br>
<br>
One question to ask a child who might show signs of being abused: "Who taught you how to do that?  Where did you learn how to do that? Did somebody show you how to do that, or make you do that?"<br>
Questions like those could help you find out who is behind the abuse.<br>
<br>
Genesis 3:11 (NLT)<br>
"Who told you that you were naked?" the Lord God asked. "Have you eaten from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All children have the right to grow up safe from abuse. Talking with children about sexual abuse and trying to protect children from people who commit sexual abuse is part of creating safe environments that help children grow and thrive.<br>
Talking about child sexual abuse helps keep children safe.<br>
It's OK to say no or move away from someone who tries to give you a kiss.<br>
Saying no to unwanted touch or activity is an important part of staying safe from sexual abuse for your child or the child you're caring for.<br>
<br>
If your child doesn't want to be tickled, kissed or hugged by an adult or older child, it's OK for your child to say no and move away. It's OK even if the person has been nice to your child.<br>
Your body belongs to you. No-one can touch or see your body without a good reason.<br>
Talk with your child about what to do in unsafe situations.<br>
An unsafe place is where you can't see other people around who could help you.<br>
<br>
Most child sexual abuse is carried out by someone children know. Just under half of all sexual abuse is carried out by family members, and just under half is carried out by someone else children know.<br>
Child sexual abuse is never children's fault, no matter what happened or how it happened.<br>
People who sexually abuse children are solely and fully responsible for their actions.<br>
Child sexual abuse is a serious crime. It harms children mentally and physically, now and into the future.<br>
Children of all ages, even babies, can be at risk of sexual abuse. Both girls and boys can be sexually abused.<br>
<br>
Child sexual abuse is always a crime.<br>
If your child or a child you're caring for tells you about sexual abuse, it's normal to feel anger, shock or worry.<br>
But you will need to put your feelings aside for a time so you can help your child feel safe, so that he or she will be able to tell you about what has happened.<br>
<br>
Listen carefully to your child without interrupting. Let your child tell the story in their own words and at their own pace.<br>
Believe your child. Tell your child that you believe them, even if what your child is saying seems unreal or doesn't make sense at first.<br>
Tell your child that it's not their fault, they're not to blame, and they won't be punished.<br>
Tell your child they've done the right thing by telling you. Your child has been brave to tell you about the abuse, so acknowledge your child's courage.<br>
Talk with your child about how you can help them feel safe and loved. Be prepared to do what your child needs you to do.<br>
<br>
Your child might not tell you everything at once. Your child might tell you more about it gradually over several days or weeks. Be patient and give your child time to share experiences and feelings.<br>
<br>
It's also important to be available in case your child wants to share more or needs you to be around to feel safe. This could mean staying at home with your child, taking time off work, picking your child up from school, and checking in with your child regularly.<br>
<br>
Your child might ask you to promise not to tell anyone else. You can't make that promise. But you can say that you'll do your best to keep your child safe. You can say that keeping your child safe might mean you'll need to talk to other people, but you need to let your child know what you are going to do.<br>
It's a good idea to make notes about what has happened so that you can give accurate details to the police.<br>
<br>
Child sexual abuse is always a crime.<br>
If you think that your child or the child you're caring for has been abused or if you think there's an immediate risk of abuse, you should report it.<br>
If you think a child has been abused, tell the police.<br>
In the UK, phone 999 -- In Australia, phone 000 -- In the USA, call 911.<br>
<br>
If you would like to read additional details, and learn more about what it is and what to do, how to talk about it and how to prevent it,<br>
you can start by going to the webpages mentioned earlier, and there are many more similar websites around the world that can provide similar information.<br>
<br>
So stay safe, be careful, talk to each other and pray about everyone and everything that is making you feel afraid, or mad, or sad.<br>
And pray about what you are thankful for, pray for your needs, and pray for the needs of others.<br>
Read your Bible, every day, even just a little bit every day if you can, study it, and try your best to do what the Bible says, and obey it.<br>
Love each other, help each other, and forgive each other.<br>
You'll be glad you did, forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41:10 (KJV)<br>
Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41:10 (NLT)<br>
Don't be afraid, for I am with you. Don't be discouraged, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 26:3 (NLT)<br>
You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, all whose thoughts are fixed on you!<br>

Confounded<br>
<br>
This is a Bible study where we go to some selected Bible verses in the KJV that mention the word, confound.<br>
<br>
What does the word, confound, mean?<br>
Referring again to the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries,<br>
in January 2022, we went to those online Dictionaries to look at, combine and merge together their word definitions<br>
for the word, confound.<br>
confound, means,<br>
to confuse and surprise people by being unexpected<br>
to prove someone or something wrong<br>
to defeat an enemy, plan etc<br>
to puzzle; to baffle.<br>
to defeat or thwart enemies or their schemes.<br>
to mix up or confuse one thing with another.<br>
to confuse and very much surprise someone, so that they are unable to explain or deal with a situation.<br>
If someone or something confounds you, they make you feel surprised or confused, often by showing you that your opinions or expectations of them were wrong.<br>
to astound or perplex; bewilder<br>
to mix up; confuse<br>
to treat mistakenly as similar to or identical with (one or more other things)<br>
to contradict or refute (an argument, etc)<br>
to rout or defeat (an enemy)<br>
to confuse and surprise<br>
to prove somebody/something wrong<br>
to defeat an enemy<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1:27 (KJV)<br>
but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1: 26-31 -- NLT<br>
26 Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world's eyes or powerful (or high born) or wealthy when God called you.<br>
<br>
27 Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful.<br>
(God chose those who are low born,)<br>
28 God chose things despised by the world, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important.<br>
29 As a result, no one can ever boast in the presence of God.<br>
30 God has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made him to be wisdom itself. Christ made us right with God; he made us pure and holy, and he freed us from sin.<br>
<br>
31 Therefore, as the Scriptures say, "If you want to boast, boast only about the Lord."<br>
(quoting from Jeremiah 9:24)<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 9: 23 & 24 -- NLT<br>
23<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Don't let the wise boast in their wisdom,<br>
or the powerful boast in their power,<br>
or the rich boast in their riches.<br>
24<br>
But those who wish to boast<br>
should boast in this alone:<br>
that they truly know me and understand that I am the Lord<br>
who demonstrates unfailing love<br>
and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth,<br>
and that I delight in these things.<br>
I, the Lord, have spoken!<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 22:5 (KJV)<br>
They cried unto thee, and were delivered: They trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<br>
<br>
Psalms 22: 4 & 5 (NLT)<br>
4<br>
Our ancestors trusted in you,<br>
and you rescued them.<br>
5<br>
They cried out to you and were saved.<br>
They trusted in you and were never disgraced.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17:18 (KJV)<br>
Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17: 16-18 (NLT)<br>
...I have not urged you to send disaster.<br>
You have heard everything I've said.<br>
17<br>
Lord, don't terrorise me!<br>
You alone are my hope in the day of disaster.<br>
18<br>
Bring shame and dismay on all who persecute me,<br>
but don't let me experience shame and dismay.<br>
Bring a day of terror on them.<br>
Yes, bring double destruction upon them!<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look up the word, confounded, in The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Strong's Concordance, which is a Bible concordance, an index of every word in the King James Version (KJV), constructed under the direction of James Strong, first published in 1890.<br>
<br>
Also, we will use a second reference book, titled, A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,<br>
which is more commonly known as the Brown-Driver-Briggs or BDB, based on the name of its three authors.<br>
The BDB is a standard reference for Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, first published in the year 1906.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look in the Strong's Hebrew Lexicon,<br>
and the Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions,<br>
for the Hebrew word for, confounded, which is usually the same Hebrew word for, ashamed.<br>
The Hebrew word that gets translated into ashamed and confounded, is pronounced, Boosh.<br>
Boosh is found in the Old Testament 109 times.<br>
it means,<br>
be ashamed<br>
be disappointed<br>
put to shame<br>
to act shamefully<br>
confounded<br>
confusion, brought into confusion<br>
become dry, delay<br>
to delay in shame<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 97:7 (KJV)<br>
Confounded be all they that serve graven images, That boast themselves of idols: Worship him, all ye gods.<br>
<br>
Psalms 97:7 (NLT)<br>
Those who worship idols are disgraced -- all who brag about their worthless gods -- for every god must bow to him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 35:4 (KJV)<br>
Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: Let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.<br>
<br>
Psalms 35: 1-10 (NLT)<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
O Lord, oppose those who oppose me.<br>
Fight those who fight against me.<br>
2<br>
Put on your armour, and take up your shield.<br>
Prepare for battle, and come to my aid.<br>
3<br>
Lift up your spear and javelin<br>
against those who pursue me.<br>
Let me hear you say,<br>
"I will give you victory!"<br>
4<br>
Bring shame and disgrace on those trying to kill me;<br>
turn them back and humiliate those who want to harm me.<br>
5<br>
Blow them away like chaff in the wind --<br>
a wind sent by the angel of the Lord.<br>
6<br>
Make their path dark and slippery,<br>
with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.<br>
7<br>
I did them no wrong, but they laid a trap for me.<br>
I did them no wrong, but they dug a pit to catch me.<br>
8<br>
So let sudden ruin come upon them!<br>
Let them be caught in the trap they set for me!<br>
Let them be destroyed in the pit they dug for me.<br>
9<br>
Then I will rejoice in the Lord.<br>
I will be glad because he rescues me.<br>
10<br>
With every bone in my body I will praise him:<br>
"Lord, who can compare with you?<br>
Who else rescues the helpless from the strong?<br>
Who else protects the helpless and poor from those who rob them?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 40:14 (KJV)<br>
Let them be ashamed and confounded together That seek after my soul to destroy it; Let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 40: 13-17 (NLT)<br>
13<br>
Please, Lord, rescue me!<br>
Come quickly, Lord, and help me.<br>
14<br>
May those who try to destroy me<br>
be humiliated and put to shame.<br>
May those who take delight in my trouble<br>
be turned back in disgrace.<br>
15<br>
Let them be horrified by their shame,<br>
for they said, "Aha! We've got him now!"<br>
16<br>
But may all who search for you<br>
be filled with joy and gladness in you.<br>
May those who love your salvation<br>
repeatedly shout, "The Lord is great!"<br>
17<br>
As for me, since I am poor and needy,<br>
let the Lord keep me in his thoughts.<br>
You are my helper and my saviour.<br>
O my God, do not delay.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 70:2 (KJV)<br>
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: Let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.<br>
<br>
Psalms 70: 1 & 2 (NLT)<br>
For the choir director: A psalm of David, asking God to remember him.<br>
1<br>
Please, God, rescue me!<br>
Come quickly, Lord, and help me.<br>
2<br>
May those who try to kill me<br>
be humiliated and put to shame.<br>
May those who take delight in my trouble<br>
be turned back in disgrace.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 71:13 (KJV)<br>
Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 71: 1-16 (KJV)<br>
71:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.<br>
71:2 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.<br>
(Be thou to me for a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:)<br>
71:3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.<br>
71:4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.<br>
71:5 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.<br>
71:6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.<br>
71:7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.<br>
71:8 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.<br>
71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.<br>
71:10 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,<br>
(they that watch for my soul take counsel together,)<br>
(they that observe for my soul take counsel together,)<br>
71:11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.<br>
71:12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.<br>
71:13 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.<br>
71:14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.<br>
71:15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.<br>
71:16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 71: 1-16 (NLT)<br>
1<br>
O Lord, I have come to you for protection;<br>
don't let me be disgraced.<br>
2<br>
Save me and rescue me,<br>
for you do what is right.<br>
Turn your ear to listen to me,<br>
and set me free.<br>
3<br>
Be my rock of safety<br>
where I can always hide.<br>
Give the order to save me,<br>
for you are my rock and my fortress.<br>
4<br>
My God, rescue me from the power of the wicked,<br>
from the clutches of cruel oppressors.<br>
5<br>
O Lord, you alone are my hope.<br>
I've trusted you, O Lord, from childhood.<br>
6<br>
Yes, you have been with me from birth;<br>
from my mother's womb you have cared for me.<br>
No wonder I am always praising you!<br>
7<br>
My life is an example to many,<br>
because you have been my strength and protection.<br>
8<br>
That is why I can never stop praising you;<br>
I declare your glory all day long.<br>
9<br>
And now, in my old age, don't set me aside.<br>
Don't abandon me when my strength is failing.<br>
10<br>
For my enemies are whispering against me.<br>
They are plotting together to kill me.<br>
11<br>
They say, "God has abandoned him.<br>
Let's go and get him,<br>
for no one will help him now."<br>
12<br>
O God, don't stay away.<br>
My God, please hurry to help me.<br>
13<br>
Bring disgrace and destruction on my accusers.<br>
Humiliate and shame those who want to harm me.<br>
14<br>
But I will keep on hoping for your help;<br>
I will praise you more and more.<br>
15<br>
I will tell everyone about your righteousness.<br>
All day long I will proclaim your saving power,<br>
though I am not skilled with words.<br>
(All day long I will proclaim your saving power, though I cannot count it.)<br>
16<br>
I will praise your mighty deeds, O Sovereign Lord.<br>
I will tell everyone that you alone are just.<br>

(Psalms) 71: 1-16 (TS2009)<br>
1 In You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed.<br>
2 In Your righteousness deliver and rescue me; Incline Your ear to me, and save me.<br>
3 Be to me a rock to dwell in, To go into continually. You have given the command to save me, For You are my rock and my stronghold.<br>
4 Rescue me, O my EE-Low-Heem, Out of the hand of the wrong, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel.<br>
5 For You are my expectation, Master Yaw-Who-Wah, my Trust from my youth.<br>
6 Upon You I have leaned from my birth; You took me out of my mother's womb. My praise is continually of You.<br>
7 I have become as a wonder to many, But You are my strong refuge.<br>
8 My mouth is filled with Your praise, Your splendour, all the day.<br>
9 Do not cast me off in the time of old age, When my strength fails, do not forsake me.<br>
10 For my enemies have spoken against me. And those who watch for my life Have taken counsel together,<br>
11 Saying, "EE-Low-Heem has forsaken him; Pursue and take him, for there is no one to deliver."<br>
12 O EE-Low-Heem, do not be far from me; My EE-Low-Heem, hasten to my help!<br>
13 Let those who are adversaries of my life Be ashamed, consumed, Let those who seek my evil Be covered with reproach and confusion.<br>
14 But I continually wait, And shall praise You more and more.<br>
15 My mouth recounts Your righteousness Your deliverance all the day, Though I do not know their numbers.<br>
16 I come in the might of the Master Yaw-Who-Wah; I make mention of Your righteousness, Yours alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 71:24 (KJV)<br>
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: For they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 71: 23 & 24 (NLT)<br>
23<br>
I will shout for joy and sing your praises,<br>
for you have ransomed me.<br>
24<br>
I will tell about your righteous deeds<br>
all day long,<br>
for everyone who tried to hurt me<br>
has been shamed and humiliated.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Nought is another name for the number zero in England.<br>
Zeros are noughts. Nought point one would be written as a zero, then a dot, then the number one.<br>
The game known in the United States as tic-tac-toe is called noughts and crosses in England, because<br>
in that game, what is known as a letter O in the United States is thought of as a nought, or zero, in England.<br>
I'm sure it is just a coincidence that a zero or nought, in the shape of bread dough, is called a "dough nought".<br>
The spelling for, Nought, is like this, n o u g h t.<br>
It is not the same as the knot spelled with the letter K.<br>
That knot, spelled, k n o t, is what you see in wood, in a hair style, and that knot is what you can do when you tie or twist together shoelaces, or pieces of rope, string or cloth.<br>
So, when we encounter this word, Nought, which is another name for zero, as we will see here in a moment, in Isaiah 41:12, someday, they, the men that war with thee shall be zero.<br>
They that war against thee shall not be successful, especially since we know the number will eventually be brought down to zero.<br>
The men of thy strife, the men of thy contention, the men of thy war, shall perish, shall someday be zero.<br>
Where are your accusers now? Watch the number dwindle down to zero before your eyes, as your Messiah writes about them in the dust, in the ground.<br>
Whatever is written in the ground, in the dust, is very temporary, and will soon be forgotten.<br>
<br>
John 8: 8-12 (TS2009)<br>
8 And bending down again, He wrote on the ground.<br>
9 And when they heard it, being reproved by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the older ones until the last. And Yaw-Who-Shaw was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.<br>
10 And Yaw-Who-Shaw, straightening up and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, "Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Did no one condemn you?"<br>
11 And she said, "No one, Master." And Yaw-Who-Shaw said to her, "Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more."<br>
12 Therefore Yaw-Who-Shaw spoke to them again, saying, "I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but possess the light of life."<br>
<br>
<br>
(Romans) 8:1 (TS2009)<br>
There is, then, now no condemnation to those who are in Messiah Yaw-Who-Shaw, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41: 8-13 (KJV)<br>
41:8 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.<br>
41:9 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.<br>
41:10 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.<br>
41:11 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing;<br>
(and the men of thy strife shall perish.)<br>
and they that strive with thee shall perish.<br>
41:12 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.<br>
(Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even the men of thy contention: the men of thy war shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.)<br>
41:13 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41: 8-13 (NLT)<br>
8<br>
"But as for you, Israel my servant,<br>
Jacob my chosen one,<br>
descended from Abraham my friend,<br>
9<br>
I have called you back from the ends of the earth,<br>
saying, 'You are my servant.'<br>
For I have chosen you<br>
and will not throw you away.<br>
10<br>
Don't be afraid, for I am with you.<br>
Don't be discouraged, for I am your God.<br>
I will strengthen you and help you.<br>
I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.<br>
11<br>
"See, all your angry enemies lie there,<br>
confused and humiliated.<br>
Anyone who opposes you will die<br>
and come to nothing.<br>
12<br>
You will look in vain<br>
for those who tried to conquer you.<br>
Those who attack you<br>
will come to nothing.<br>
13<br>
For I hold you by your right hand --<br>
I, the Lord your God.<br>
And I say to you,<br>
'Don't be afraid. I am here to help you.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45: 16 & 17 (NLT)<br>
16<br>
All craftsmen who make idols will be humiliated.<br>
They will all be disgraced together.<br>
17<br>

with eternal salvation.<br>
Throughout everlasting ages,<br>
they will never again be humiliated and disgraced.<br>

Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 10: 14-16 (NLT)<br>
14<br>
The whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge!<br>
The craftsmen are disgraced by the idols they make,<br>
for their carefully shaped works are a fraud.<br>
These idols have no breath or power.<br>
15<br>
Idols are worthless; they are ridiculous lies!<br>
On the day of reckoning they will all be destroyed.<br>
16<br>
But (the Portion of Jacob,) the God of Israel is no idol!<br>
He is the Creator of everything that exists,<br>
including Israel, his own special possession.<br>
The Lord of Heaven's Armies (The Lord of Hosts, Yaw-Who-Wah Say-Vah-Oat) is his name!<br>

Jeremiah 22: 21 & 22 (NLT)<br>
21<br>
I warned you when you were prosperous,<br>
but you replied, 'Don't bother me.'<br>
You have been that way since childhood --<br>
you simply will not obey me!<br>
22<br>
And now the wind will blow away your allies.<br>
All your friends will be taken away as captives.<br>
Surely then you will see your wickedness and be ashamed.<br>

Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.<br>

17<br>
The whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge!<br>

These idols have no breath or power.<br>
18<br>
Idols are worthless; they are ridiculous lies!<br>

45<br>
"Come out, my people, flee from Babylon.<br>
Save yourselves! Run from the Lord's fierce anger.<br>
46<br>
But do not panic; don't be afraid<br>
when you hear the first rumour of approaching forces.<br>
For rumours will keep coming year by year.<br>
Violence will erupt in the land<br>
as the leaders fight against each other.<br>
47<br>
For the time is surely coming<br>
when I will punish this great city and all her idols.<br>
Her whole land will be disgraced,<br>
and her dead will lie in the streets.<br>
48<br>
Then the heavens and earth will rejoice,<br>
for out of the north will come destroying armies<br>
against Babylon," says the Lord.<br>
49<br>
"Just as Babylon killed the people of Israel<br>
and others throughout the world,<br>
so must her people be killed.<br>
50<br>
Get out, all you who have escaped the sword!<br>
Do not stand and watch -- flee while you can!<br>
Remember the Lord, though you are in a far-off land,<br>
and think about your home in Jerusalem."<br>
51<br>
"We are ashamed," the people say.<br>
"We are insulted and disgraced<br>
because the Lord's Temple<br>
has been defiled by foreigners."<br>
52<br>
"Yes," says the Lord, "but the time is coming<br>
when I will destroy Babylon's idols.<br>
The groans of her wounded people<br>
will be heard throughout the land.<br>
53<br>
Though Babylon reaches as high as the heavens<br>
and makes her fortifications incredibly strong,<br>
I will still send enemies to plunder her.<br>
I, the Lord, (Yaw-Who-Wah,) have spoken!<br>

3:6 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.<br>
(Therefore night shall be unto you, from a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, from divining; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.)<br>
3:7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, (they shall all cover their upper lip) they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.<br>
3:8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgement, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 3: 5-8 (NLT)<br>
5<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"You false prophets are leading my people astray!<br>
You promise peace for those who give you food,<br>
but you declare war on those who refuse to feed you.<br>
6<br>
Now the night will close around you,<br>
cutting off all your visions.<br>
Darkness will cover you,<br>
putting an end to your predictions.<br>
The sun will set for you prophets,<br>
and your day will come to an end.<br>
7<br>
Then you seers will be put to shame,<br>
and you fortune-tellers will be disgraced.<br>
And you will cover your faces<br>
because there is no answer from God."<br>
8<br>
But as for me, I am filled with power --<br>
with the Spirit of the Lord.<br>
(the wind, the breath, the Roo-Awk of Yaw-Who-Wah)<br>
I am filled with justice and strength<br>
to boldly declare Israel's sin and rebellion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7:16 (KJV)<br>
The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 15-18 (NLT)<br>
15<br>
"Yes," says the Lord,<br>
"I will do mighty miracles for you,<br>
like those I did when I rescued you<br>
from slavery in Egypt."<br>
16<br>
All the nations of the world will stand amazed<br>
at what the Lord will do for you.<br>
They will be embarrassed<br>
at their feeble power.<br>
They will cover their mouths in silent awe,<br>
deaf to everything around them.<br>
17<br>
Like snakes crawling from their holes,<br>
they will come out to meet the Lord our God.<br>
They will fear him greatly,<br>
trembling in terror at his presence.<br>
18<br>
Where is another God like you,<br>
who pardons the guilt of the remnant,<br>
overlooking the sins of his special people?...<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 15-18 (TS2009)<br>
15 "As in the days when you came out of (the world) the land of Egypt (the land of Meets-Rye-EEm), I shall let him see wonders."<br>
16 Let the nations see and be ashamed of all their might, let them put their hand over their mouth, let their ears be deaf.<br>
17 Let them lick the dust like a serpent, let them come trembling from their strongholds like snakes of the earth, let them be afraid of Yaw-Who-Wah our EE-Low-Heem and fear because of You.<br>
18 Who is an EE-Low-Heem like You -- taking away crookedness and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance?...<br>

<br>
Commentary: How do you live forever?<br>
How do you get eternal life?<br>
<br>
Not by bread alone, but you live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God.<br>
What does that mean?  It sounds like a riddle! Here is an idea to consider. Maybe this is the answer to the riddle.<br>
The bread is the bread of life, which is Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw. To receive and eat that bread would be to believe and receive the New Testament, the new Covenant, the bread, broken for you.<br>
<br>
Every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, that would be when God spoke and gave us the commandments in the Old Testament, the Torah, and Moses wrote them down.  Look closely at the Hebrew language, and you will see that The Ten Commandments are also known as the Ten Words. It says, every word, that would be each and every commandment, as in, all of the commandments, not some, not half, not most, but all commandments. Obey every commandment, every single word of them.<br>
<br>
Put these two together, the bread of life, and every word came out of the mouth of God, and live.<br>
The living bread of life points to the New Testament, and the word of God, the commandments of EE-Low-Heem, that points to the Old Testament, the Old Covenant.<br>
<br>
Your relationship with the Heavenly Father, Yaw-Who-Wah, is like a marriage relationship, not of the human, physical, gender kind, but of a spiritual kind.<br>
<br>
The New Testament is getting married, and the Old Testament tells you how to stay successfully married.<br>
<br>
If you only read and obey the Old Testament and you ignore the New Testament, that is like doing the boyfriend-girlfriend dating relationship, but you are not technically or legally married. You act like you are, you pretend like you are, but you're not. You can pretend, and do sexual activity like a married couple, and share your time, your decisions, and your finances, but you are still not married. It's like someone who rejects Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, and all they do is try to obey the commandments in the Old Testament Torah.  Doing all of that, without Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, will not get you into heaven. It's also like driving a car, every day, for months and months, perfectly obeying all of the traffic laws, but never getting a legal licence to drive.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other people like to read and obey the New Testament and ignore the Old Testament.  That is like actually getting married, and then staying exactly the same, and living your life like you never got married, even though you point to the marriage license, John 3:16 and Romans 10:9, telling everyone you are married, but you refuse to let the marriage change you in any way.  Let's say, as a man, before you were married, you always went out drinking with the guys for hours at night, then you spend your Saturdays, spending hours watching porn and playing video games, then you spend hours on Sunday doing nothing but watching football.  Then you get married, and you keep doing that?<br>
<br>
Or let's say, as a woman, when you were single, you spent hours doing the most amazing dance moves on the discotheque dance floor at the local nightclub, flirting with every hot guy.  Then, you get married, and before you know it, here is your baby crying because its nappy (its diaper) needs changing, but you're too busy dancing and texting all your guy friends?  Does that sound like a marriage that's going to last?  Believing in Jesus and then staying exactly the same, ignoring all of His commandments? A new heart I will give you? No, thanks. Be transformed by the renewing of your mind? Not now. I'm too busy making my next Tik Tok video of me doing sexy dancing whilst the baby keeps crying? That's like getting your legal licence to drive, but then you continue ignoring all traffic laws in the driver's manual. What? Actually stop at a red traffic light or stop sign?  I'm supposed to drive on the right side of the road in the United States? I'm saved and forgiven, I'm under grace, I'm not under the law. If I ignore and forget and disobey all traffic laws in the driver's manual, the Torah, the Bible, how soon will I crash and die?<br>
<br>
Getting a driving licence is one thing, but continuing to obey the traffic laws in the driver's manual, is what makes your driving successful.<br>
<br>
Getting married is one thing, but staying married is what makes a marriage be successful.  Getting married is New Testament believing in and receiving the Messiah, the Muh-She-Awk, and staying married, is Old Testament, Torah Commandment Obedience.  Those verses that we just looked at, they tell us that He lives in you, dwells in you, and causes you to obey his commandments, by fixing your heart and transforming your mind.<br>
<br>
Since the first shall be last and the last shall be first, eat the bread, then eat the scroll and live. Receive the New Testament, and obey the Old Testament, and live. Receive the bread of life, and obey every word that proceeded out of the mouth of Elohim, and live, forever. Receive the Messiah and obey the Torah, and live, forever. You can't live by bread alone. Get both, read, study, pray, receive, believe, follow, trust, obey, forgive, and live.<br>

In The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 23, also known officially as, Christian Essays 23,<br>
We did a Bible Study, titled, Sober.<br>
<br>
Here is a short sample from that study.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 31:4 (KJV)<br>
...it is not for kings to drink wine; Nor for princes strong drink:<br>
<br>
Proverbs 31:4-5 NLT<br>
4<br>
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, to guzzle wine.<br>
Rulers should not crave alcohol.<br>
5<br>
For if they drink, they may forget the law<br>
and not give justice to the oppressed.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 3: 1-3 KJV<br>
3:1 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.<br>
3:2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, (modest,) of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;<br>
3:3 Not given to wine, (not ready to quarrel and offer wrong as one in wine,) no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 3: 1-3 NLT<br>
(If someone aspires to be a church leader, an overseer, or a bishop, he desires an honourable position.)<br>
1 This is a trustworthy saying: "If someone aspires to be a church leader, he desires an honourable position."<br>
<br>
2 So a church leader must be a man whose life is above reproach. He must be faithful to his wife. He must exercise self-control, live wisely, and have a good reputation. He must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must be able to teach.<br>
(He must have only one wife, he must be married only once, he must be the husband of one wife.)<br>
3 He must not be a heavy drinker or be violent.<br>
(He must not drink too much wine.)<br>
He must be gentle, not quarrelsome, and not love money.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28: 5-7 KJV<br>
28:5 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,<br>
28:6 And for a spirit of judgement to him that sitteth in judgement, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.<br>
28:7 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgement.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28: 5-7 NLT<br>
5<br>
Then at last the Lord of Heaven's Armies<br>
will himself be Israel's glorious crown.<br>
He will be the pride and joy<br>
of the remnant of his people.<br>
6<br>
He will give a longing for justice<br>
to their judges.<br>
He will give great courage<br>
to their warriors who stand at the gates.<br>
7<br>
Now, however, Israel is led by drunks<br>
who reel with wine and stagger with alcohol.<br>
The priests and prophets stagger with alcohol<br>
and lose themselves in wine.<br>
They reel when they see visions<br>
and stagger as they render decisions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Those were some samples from The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 23, also known officially as, Christian Essays 23,<br>
from a Bible Study, titled, Sober.<br>
There are several more examples in that Bible study.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  It seems that, if someone is now, or is going to be in a leadership position for a church or fellowship, also known as a priest, or if someone is now or is going to be in a leadership role for a government or nation, also known as some sort of king, it is possible to come to the conclusion, or have the opinion, that, according to some Scriptures, this person should not be drinking alcohol. A personal opinion that I seem to lock onto is this.  If the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, ever wanted to use me in a leadership position, like a king or priest, then I should not be drinking any alcohol, so that I can think clearly and make clear-headed, sober judgements and decisions.<br>
<br>
It has always been strongly on my heart to not drink alcohol, and, there are several Bible verses to support this, especially if one is to be any kind of priest or king.<br>
<br>
Now, you might think, well, you are not a king or priest. I don't think that you are ever, ever going to be an actual king or priest! Right?<br>
<br>
Wrong!  I AM going to be a king or priest. I really am! Maybe you will be one as well!  Maybe, you really will!  Maybe you should think carefully about this concept of not drinking alcohol, especially since, you, yes, you, may someday very soon be a king or priest?  Since this is a Bible study, let's read the verses that can support the idea that you may someday be a king or priest, and therefore I advise you again to think carefully about this concept of drinking or not drinking alcohol. Your opinion about alcohol consumption may be a reflection of how serious and important your attitude is about your future role as a king or priest!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 19: 5 & 6 (KJV)<br>
19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:<br>

6 and has made us sovereigns and priests to His EE-Low-Heem and Father, to Him be esteem and rule forever and ever. Ah-Main.<br>
<br>
The following is a translation from a Hebrew copy of Revelation, kept at the Cambridge University Library.<br>
Hebrew-to-English translation by Justin J. Van Rensburg, titled, Ele Ha-Sodot -- The Hebrew Revelation, December 2021, Version 1.1, available at www.HebrewGospels.com<br>
Revelation 1: 4-6 -- Hebrew-to-English translation<br>
First, let's hear it with just English words,<br>
steadfast love and peace be with you, from him who was and is and will be, and from the seven spirits who are at his throne.<br>
5 And from Jesus, our Salvation Messiah, the faithful witness, and the first who stood up from the dead ones, and the ruler and commander over the earth -- who is our love, and our washing from our iniquities with his blood,<br>
6 and made us kings and priests before the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, even his Father -- to him be honour and glory, from everlasting and unto everlasting, amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
and now, let's hear it again with Hebrew words and some additional explanations...<br>
Revelation 1: 4-6 -- Hebrew-to-English translation<br>
steadfast love and shalom (Shall-Loam, peace) be with you, from this one, from he, from him who was and is and will be, and from the seven Ruchot (Roo-Oat) who are at his throne (from His throne).<br>
Roo-Oat, there in verse 4, is the Plural of ruach (Roo-Awk) -- which is the Hebrew word for "spirit," "breath" or "wind."<br>
Seven Roo-Oat are the Seven Spirits, Seven breaths or Seven winds at His throne, or from His throne.<br>
<br>
5 And from Yeshua Ha-Mashiach (Yeh-Shoe-Uh, Ha Muh-She-Awk, Salvation Our Messiah, Jesus) the faithful witness, and the first who stood up from the dead ones, and the ruler and commander over the earth -- who is our love, and our washing from our iniquities with his blood,<br>
6 and made us kings and priests before Yaw-Who-Wah even his Father  --  to him be honour and glory, from everlasting and unto everlasting, amein (Ah-Main).<br>
<br>
According to the translator, Justin J. Van Rensburg, the name, Yaw-Who-Wah, the name of the Heavenly Father, may also be pronounced as, Yah-weh.<br>
It is his opinion that Yah-weh is the only grammatically possible pronunciation for the name of the Master, the Father that is in Heaven.<br>
Ah-Main, 'Amein' is used as an adverb that means "surely" or "truly."<br>
The Hebrew name for 'John.' is Yochanan (Yoe-Cuh-Non).<br>
Yochanan repeatedly reminds us (in several places, like, in chapters 1, 4, 5, and 6, for example) that he was an eyewitness of the things described here in the book of Revelation.<br>
<br>
In verse 5, the part that says, ruler and commander, seems to be pointing to...<br>
Isaiah 55:4 (KJV)<br>
Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Commentary: I know that, as long there are families hiding out there, scattered here and there, with young men and women in those families loving the Heavenly Father, believing in His beloved Messiah, and trying their best to love and forgive, and study and obey the Bible, the Scriptures, the Torah, then there is still hope in this land, and in these times, no mater how bad it gets.<br>
<br>
There once was a beautiful, young lady that lived just down the street. She was part of a big family. Eventually, we moved away, and moved around, and so did they. I will never forget her. She was a huge blessing to our family and continues be a blessing every day. We still love her and we keep praying for her and her whole family every day. Even though I miss her, I know that we will be together again someday in the kingdom of Heaven. Here are some Bible verses that remind me of her, verses that make me think of her, and the beautiful things that I saw in her, in her spirit and in her heart.<br>

<br>
<br>
Commentary: After He wipes away every tear, he puts it in a bottle and documents exactly what the story was behind that tear, and what it meant, and what it was all about.<br>
He knows the full story behind every tear you have ever cried, even the tear you secretly cry in bed late at night.<br>
In heaven, I imagine that it would be rare and special to see the bottle of tears that he collected, because no one cries tears in Heaven, because nobody ever has any reason to ever cry there.<br>
When we have been there a million years later, I'll say, hey, remember this bottle of mine, here, of this liquid stuff that leaked out of our eyeballs back on earth, before we came to heaven?<br>
And then someone says, why would liquid leak out of our eyeballs like that?<br>
And then, I'd probably say, uh, I don't remember why anymore.<br>
Something back then, I think it was called, crying, or dust, or something like that, and we don't have any of that here in the kingdom.<br>
I guess it doesn't matter anymore.<br>
Oh wait. Here's a little book next to the bottle that explains why it happened.<br>
<br>
Hey you over there, why is your bottle of tears over there empty? Hand me that book next to it.<br>
It says in here, Baby entered the kingdom before she was born.<br>
I love reading books that have a happy ending!<br>

56:10 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.<br>

You have recorded each one in your book.<br>
9<br>
My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help.<br>

10<br>
I praise God for what he has promised;<br>

11<br>
I trust in God, so why should I be afraid?<br>
What can mere mortals do to me?<br>
<br>
Psalms 56: 8-13 (TS2009)<br>
8 You have counted my wanderings; You put my tears into Your bottle; Are they not in Your book?<br>

10 In Elohim, whose Word I praise, In Yaw-Who-Wah, whose Word I praise,<br>
11 In Elohim I have trusted; I do not fear; What could man do to me?<br>
12 On me, O Elohim, are Your vows; I render praises to You,<br>
13 For You have delivered my life from death, My feet from stumbling, That I might walk before Elohim, In the light of the living!<br>

and my upraised hands as an evening offering.<br>
3<br>

and guard my lips.<br>

Psalms 141: 1-3 (TS2009)<br>
1 Yaw-Who-Wah, I have cried out to You; Hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I cry out to You.<br>
2 Let my prayer be prepared before You as incense, The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.<br>
3 O Yaw-Who-Wah, set a guard for my mouth; Watch over the door of my lips.<br>
<br>
Commentary: When you drink the communion at the Lord's Supper, the symbol of His blood touches the door of your lips as you drink.<br>
It is a symbol of how they would put the blood of the Passover Lamb on the door of the house.<br>
The lamb goes into the house. The lamb goes into the body. The lamb goes into you and dwells within you.<br>
Your body is the house that He dwells in. What you drink, touches your lips as it enters into you.<br>
The wine or juice touches the doorposts of your lips, of you. The blood of the Passover Lamb would be placed upon the doorposts of the house that they were staying in.<br>
Guard and watch over the door of my lips. Watch the angel of death Passover, because of the blood of the Lamb that was slain.<br>
<br>
<br>

Pray for His help first. Don't try to figure it out for yourself.<br>
Don't Google it first. Pray about it first.<br>
Get His advice first, get His wisdom first.<br>
One prayer, and He could heal and fix it!<br>
Even if you have walked 1000 miles away from Him, He is still just one prayer away!<br>
Here is what it looks like when you don't seek Him first...<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 16: 12 & 13 -- KJV<br>
16:12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.<br>
16:13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 16: 12 & 13 -- NLT<br>
12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a serious foot disease. Yet even with the severity of his disease, he did not seek the Lord's help but turned only to his physicians.<br>
13 So he died in the forty-first year of his reign.<br>

Commentary:<br>
Sharing the Word of God always produces fruit.<br>
It always does, every time, even if you don't see what it does.<br>
Here are a few examples to think about.<br>
Some are in the New Testament, and one is in the Old Testament.<br>
They all talk about teaching, sharing and distributing the messages in the Bible to people in other locations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 16:15 (KJV)<br>
And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 10: 6-8 (KJV)<br>
10:6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br>
10:7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.<br>
10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 17: verses 7, 9 and 10 -- KJV<br>
17:7 Also in the third year of his reign he (Jehoshaphat) sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.<br>
17:9 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.<br>
<br>
17:10 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah,<br>
(And the fear of the LORD was upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah,)<br>
so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 17: verses 7, 9 and 10 -- NLT<br>
7 In the third year of his reign Jehoshaphat sent his officials to teach in all the towns of Judah. These officials included Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah.<br>
9 They took copies of the Book of the Law of the Lord and travelled around through all the towns of Judah, teaching the people.<br>
10 Then the fear of the Lord fell over all the surrounding kingdoms so that none of them wanted to declare war on Jehoshaphat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 17: verses 7, 9 and 10 -- TS2009<br>
7 And in the third year of his reign he (Yehoshaphat) sent his leaders, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah (Yeh-Who-Duh).<br>
9 And they taught in Judah (Yeh-Who-Duh), and with them was the Book of the Torah of Yaw-Who-Wah. And they went around into all the cities of Judah (Yeh-Who-Duh) and taught the people.<br>
10 And the fear of Yaw-Who-Wah fell on all the reigns of the lands that were around Judah, and they did not fight against Yehoshaphat.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 55:11 (KJV)<br>
so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 55:11 (NLT)<br>
It is the same with my word. I send it out, and it always produces fruit. It will accomplish all I want it to, and it will prosper everywhere I send it.<br>
<br>
(Isaiah) 55:11 (TS2009)<br>
so is My Word that goes forth from My mouth -- it does not return to Me empty, but shall do what I please, and shall certainly accomplish what I sent it for.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 55: starting in verse 6, and we keep reading into the next chapter,<br>
until we get to chapter 56, verse 8 -- KJV<br>
55:6 Seek ye the LORD whilst he may be found, call ye upon him whilst he is near:<br>
55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br>
55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.<br>
55:9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.<br>
55:10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:<br>
55:11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.<br>
55:12 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.<br>
55:13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.<br>
56:1 Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgement, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.<br>
56:2 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.<br>
56:3 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.<br>
56:4 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;<br>
56:5 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.<br>
56:6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;<br>
56:7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.<br>
56:8 The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 55: starting in verse 6, and we keep reading into the next chapter,<br>
until we get to chapter 56, verse 8 -- NLT<br>
6<br>
Seek the Lord whilst you can find him.<br>
Call on him now whilst he is near.<br>
7<br>
Let the wicked change their ways<br>
and banish the very thought of doing wrong.<br>
Let them turn to the Lord that he may have mercy on them.<br>
Yes, turn to our God, for he will forgive generously.<br>
8<br>
"My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts," says the Lord.<br>
"And my ways are far beyond anything you could imagine.<br>
9<br>
For just as the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>
so my ways are higher than your ways<br>
and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.<br>
10<br>
"The rain and snow come down from the heavens<br>
and stay on the ground to water the earth.<br>
They cause the grain to grow,<br>
producing seed for the farmer<br>
and bread for the hungry.<br>
11<br>
It is the same with my word.<br>
I send it out, and it always produces fruit.<br>
It will accomplish all I want it to,<br>
and it will prosper everywhere I send it.<br>
12<br>
You will live in joy and peace.<br>
The mountains and hills will burst into song,<br>
and the trees of the field will clap their hands!<br>
13<br>
Where once there were thorns, cypress trees will grow.<br>
Where nettles grew, myrtles will sprout up.<br>
These events will bring great honour to the Lord's name;<br>
they will be an everlasting sign of his power and love."<br>
1<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Be just and fair to all.<br>
Do what is right and good,<br>
for I am coming soon to rescue you<br>
and to display my righteousness amongst you.<br>
2<br>
Blessed are all those<br>
who are careful to do this.<br>
Blessed are those who honour my Sabbath days of rest<br>
and keep themselves from doing wrong.<br>
3<br>
"Don't let foreigners who commit themselves to the Lord say,<br>
'The Lord will never let me be part of his people.'<br>
And don't let the eunuchs say,<br>
'I'm a dried-up tree with no children and no future.'<br>
4<br>
For this is what the Lord says:<br>
I will bless those eunuchs<br>
who keep my Sabbath days holy<br>
and who choose to do what pleases me<br>
and commit their lives to me.<br>
5<br>
I will give them -- within the walls of my house --<br>
a memorial and a name<br>
far greater than sons and daughters could give.<br>
For the name I give them is an everlasting one.<br>
It will never disappear!<br>
6<br>
"I will also bless the foreigners who commit themselves to the Lord,<br>
who serve him and love his name,<br>
who worship him and do not desecrate the Sabbath day of rest,<br>
and who hold fast to my covenant.<br>
7<br>
I will bring them to my holy mountain of Jerusalem<br>
and will fill them with joy in my house of prayer.<br>
I will accept their burnt offerings and sacrifices,<br>
because my Temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations.<br>
8<br>
For the Sovereign Lord,<br>
who brings back the outcasts of Israel, says:<br>
I will bring others, too,<br>
besides my people Israel."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Israel, in the Hebrew language, is pronounced, Yis-Rye-ELL in the TS2009,<br>
and in the Eth Cepher, Israel, is pronounced, Yaw-Shaw-Rell.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 55: starting again in verse 6, and we keep reading,<br>
until we get to Isaiah 56, verse 8 -- TS2009<br>
6 Seek Yaw-Who-Wah whilst He is to be found, call on Him whilst He is near.<br>
7 Let the wrong forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts. Let him return to Yaw-Who-Wah, who has compassion on him, and to our Elohim, for He pardons much.<br>
8 "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways," declares Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
9 "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.<br>
10 "For as the rain comes down, and the snow from the heavens, and do not return there, but water the earth, and make it bring forth and bud, and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater,<br>
11 so is My Word that goes forth from My mouth -- it does not return to Me empty, but shall do what I please, and shall certainly accomplish what I sent it for.<br>
12 "For with joy you go out, and with peace you are brought in -- the mountains and the hills break forth into singing before you, and all the trees of the field clap the hands.<br>
13 "Instead of the thorn the cypress comes up, and instead of the nettle the myrtle comes up. And it shall be to Yaw-Who-Wah for a name, for an everlasting sign which is not cut off."<br>
1 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, "Guard right-ruling, and do righteousness, for near is My deliverance to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.<br>
2 "Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who becomes strong in it, guarding the Sabbath lest he profane it, and guarding his hand from doing any evil.<br>
3 "And let not the son of the foreigner who has joined himself to Yaw-Who-Wah speak, saying, 'Yaw-Who-Wah has certainly separated me from His people,' nor let the eunuch say, 'Look I am a dry tree.'"<br>
4 For thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, "To the eunuchs who guard My Sabbaths, and have chosen what pleases Me, and are holding onto My covenant:<br>
5 to them I shall give in My house and within My walls a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters -- I give them an everlasting name that is not cut off.<br>
6 "Also the sons of the foreigner who join themselves to Yaw-Who-Wah, to serve Him, and to love the Name of Yaw-Who-Wah, to be His servants, all who guard the Sabbath, and not profane it, and are holding onto My covenant --<br>
7 them I shall bring to My set-apart mountain, and let them rejoice in My house of prayer. Their ascending offerings and their slaughterings are accepted on My slaughter-place, for My house is called a house of prayer for all the peoples."<br>
8 The Master Yaw-Who-Wah, who gathers the outcasts of Israel (Yis-Rye-ELL, Yaw-Shaw-Rell), declares, "I gather still others to him besides those who are gathered to him."<br>
