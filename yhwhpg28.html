<a name="JAH28BADTOUCH"></a><h2>Abuse</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Near the end of the previous chapter, The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 27, officially known as Christian Essays 27, we had recently touched on and prayed about the difficult topic of child sexual abuse.<br>
With that in mind, we will now put together some notes that were extracted from and based on the content found on these two webpages...<br>
<br>
RFUT:&nbsp; Raising Children Network (Australia):&nbsp; Signs That Someone Is Involved In Child Sexual Abuse<br>
<a href="https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/safety/child-sexual-abuse/signs-that-someone-is-involved-in-child-sexual-abuse">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/safety/child-sexual-abuse/signs-that-someone-is-involved-in-child-sexual-abuse</a><br>
RFUT:&nbsp; Raising Children Network (Australia):&nbsp; Child Sexual Abuse -- What To Do If A Child Is Sexually Abused<br>
<a href="https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/safety/child-sexual-abuse/child-sexual-abuse-what-to-do">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/safety/child-sexual-abuse/child-sexual-abuse-what-to-do</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With some quotes and some paraphrased material from those two webpages, I feel that we should be on guard, and be looking out for<br>
Signs that someone is involved in child sexual abuse<br>
or the possible signs that someone might be wanting to sexually abuse children.<br>
Let's take a moment to think about this topic.<br>
<br>
This message is for children, for young children, for older children that are having to take care of or look after younger children, and parents, and families,<br>
and also other parents or adults who spend some time having to take care of or look after children.<br>
<br>
You should think about reading all of this message to your children and to your family.<br>
<br>
Preventing child sexual abuse starts with your family and community.<br>
If you suspect a child has experienced sexual abuse in your community, report your concerns to the police,<br>
In the UK, phone 999 -- In Australia, phone 000 -- In the USA, call 911.<br>
<br>
May the Holy Spirit show you the truth about the people and family members in your life.<br>
May the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, guard you and protect you from being the victim of someone else's sin.<br>
<br>
A person who may love or care about someone, may do these things...<br>
They try to build trusting relationships,<br>
they try to be very supportive and caring, with best interests at heart.<br>
Some people are just very curious or care a lot about your family and your child.<br>
Some people may want to show love, and support for helping with families and children.<br>
From a Christian perspective, this would also include helping to encourage families and children with their relationship with the Heavenly Father and His Son, our Saviour,<br>
and to encourage families and children to pray and read their Bible, and try our best to follow Him, and obey Him.<br>
Previously, in Christian Essays 27, we had a long List of Needs, because good people will pray for each other, and will try to help each other with their List of Needs,<br>
making sure that families and children have all of their needs met.<br>
See the Bible study that we have on the previous page, Christian Essays 27, titled, List of Needs.<br>
<br>
A good person may want to love and help, and help as well as they can, local families and children have all of their needs met.
A good person may care a lot about your family and your child.<br>
Unfortunately, an evil person, who wants to do child sexual abuse, will also pretend to do all of those same things.<br>
Is that child who is younger than you, a good person, or a bad person pretending to be good?<br>
Is that older child or adult, a good person, or a bad person pretending to be good?<br>
A good person and a bad person can do those good things, or pretend like they want to do, all of those good things that we were just talking about.<br>
<br>
Matthew 7:15 (NLT)<br>
"Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves.<br>
<br>
Not everyone who behaves in these ways should be kept away from your child.<br>
Some people are just very curious or care a lot about your family and your child.<br>
A good person may normally do or want to do all of those things that we just mentioned.<br>
<br>
But, there are some additional things that the bad person will try to do.<br>
A good person may do some of this, but a bad person may really, really try very hard to do the following things more and more...<br>
If you notice someone behaving in the following ways around your child or the child you're caring for, this might be cause for concern about child sexual abuse.<br>
<br>
The person that might be a bad person, maybe, who might want to sexually abuse children:<br>
Will try to be alone with your child to create the opportunity to do the abuse.<br>
The person persistently tries to spend time alone with your child -- for example, asks to babysit your child, or invites your child to stay overnight at their place or go camping with them.<br>
The person frequently separates your child from other adults or children and seeks 'special time' with them.<br>
The person is secretive and doesn't share information with you about how they've spent time with your child.<br>
The person tries to undermine your relationship with your child by doing things, like telling your child you're a bad parent.<br>
The person buys your child treats or gifts, which might become more frequent and more expensive.<br>
The person insists on kisses, hugs or other physical contact from your child  --  for example, frequent tickling games or other rough-and-tumble play that involves touching, or getting your child to sit on their lap.<br>
The person is unusually interested in your child's body or sexual development, or appearance, or compliments your child excessively.<br>
The person takes too many photos of your child, and friends your child on social media.<br>
<br>
Child sexual abuse is when someone, another child or an adult, tries to look at or touch the private areas of a child's body, for fun, but they end up hurting the child.<br>
Hurting a child's body for fun is wrong, and that is why Child sexual abuse is always a serious crime.<br>
They usually wait until they are alone with the child before trying to do those things.<br>
Then they say that they must keep it a secret, and that they are supposed to like it, and that it is supposed to feel good doing that.<br>
People who sexually abuse children need the abuse to be a secret.<br>
You should never keep secrets that don't feel right, and You should never keep secrets that are making you feel afraid or unsafe.<br>
Child sexual abuse is when adults or older children involve children in sexual activity.<br>
Child sexual abuse is never a child's fault.<br>
<br>
<br>
People who sexually abuse children are likely to be family members or people you know well.<br>
People who sexually abuse children often try to build trust with the child's family.<br>
They can be older adults, young adults, teenage kids, or even children younger than you that may try to sexually abuse another child or adult.<br>
They might be adults, young people or older children.<br>
They can be family or friends, from work, from school, living near you, from your church or fellowship, or they could be very far away, online, trying to send and receive the abusive content to and from your child.<br>
The difficult part, is that, People who sexually abuse children look and act like everyone else. They don't look, sound or dress in a particular way.<br>
<br>
Children who have been sexually abused,<br>
They might say that they liked the abuse, or act like they liked it, and that it made them feel good,<br>
They might talk about sex a lot and show behaviour in forms of verbal and non-verbal communication or gestures that could be interpreted as sexual.<br>
Abused children who try to sexually abuse other children will talk to the other child about sex, and their sexual experiences, and he or she may try to send or share or show the other child sexual or pornographic pictures or videos on their phone.<br>
<br>
<br>
All children have the right to grow up safe from abuse. Talking with children about sexual abuse and trying to protect children from people who commit sexual abuse is part of creating safe environments that help children grow and thrive.<br>
Talking about child sexual abuse helps keep children safe.<br>
It's OK to say no or move away from someone who tries to give you a kiss.<br>
Saying no to unwanted touch or activity is an important part of staying safe from sexual abuse for your child or the child you're caring for.<br>
<br>
If your child doesn't want to be tickled, kissed or hugged by an adult or older child, it's OK for your child to say no and move away. It's OK even if the person has been nice to your child.<br>
Your body belongs to you. No-one can touch or see your body without a good reason.<br>
Talk with your child about what to do in unsafe situations.<br>
An unsafe place is where you can't see other people around who could help you.<br>
<br>
Most child sexual abuse is carried out by someone children know. Just under half of all sexual abuse is carried out by family members, and just under half is carried out by someone else children know.<br>
Child sexual abuse is never children's fault, no matter what happened or how it happened.<br>
People who sexually abuse children are solely and fully responsible for their actions.<br>
Child sexual abuse is a serious crime. It harms children mentally and physically, now and into the future.<br>
Children of all ages, even babies, can be at risk of sexual abuse. Both girls and boys can be sexually abused.<br>
<br>
Child sexual abuse is always a crime.<br>
If your child or a child you're caring for tells you about sexual abuse, it's normal to feel anger, shock or worry.<br>
But you will need to put your feelings aside for a time so you can help your child feel safe, so that he or she will be able to tell you about what has happened.<br>
<br>
Listen carefully to your child without interrupting. Let your child tell the story in their own words and at their own pace.<br>
Believe your child. Tell your child that you believe them, even if what your child is saying seems unreal or doesn't make sense at first.<br>
Tell your child that it's not their fault, they're not to blame, and they won't be punished.<br>
Tell your child they've done the right thing by telling you. Your child has been brave to tell you about the abuse, so acknowledge your child's courage.<br>
Talk with your child about how you can help them feel safe and loved. Be prepared to do what your child needs you to do.<br>
<br>
Your child might not tell you everything at once. Your child might tell you more about it gradually over several days or weeks. Be patient and give your child time to share experiences and feelings.<br>
<br>
It's also important to be available in case your child wants to share more or needs you to be around to feel safe. This could mean staying at home with your child, taking time off work, picking your child up from school, and checking in with your child regularly.<br>
<br>
Your child might ask you to promise not to tell anyone else. You can't make that promise. But you can say that you'll do your best to keep your child safe. You can say that keeping your child safe might mean you'll need to talk to other people, but you need to let your child know what you are going to do.<br>
It's a good idea to make notes about what has happened so that you can give accurate details to the police.<br>
<br>
Child sexual abuse is always a crime.<br>
If you think that your child or the child you're caring for has been abused or if you think there's an immediate risk of abuse, you should report it.<br>
If you think a child has been abused, tell the police.<br>
In the UK, phone 999 -- In Australia, phone 000 -- In the USA, call 911.<br>
<br>
If you would like to read additional details, and learn more about what it is and what to do, how to talk about it and how to prevent it,<br>
you can start by going to the webpages mentioned earlier, and there are many more similar websites around the world that can provide similar information.<br>
<br>
So stay safe, be careful, talk to each other and pray about everyone and everything that is making you feel afraid, or mad, or sad.<br>
And pray about what you are thankful for, pray for your needs, and pray for the needs of others.<br>
Read your Bible, every day, even just a little bit every day if you can, study it, and try your best to do what the Bible says, and obey it.<br>
Love each other, help each other, and forgive each other.<br>
You'll be glad you did, forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41:10 (KJV)<br>
Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41:10 (NLT)<br>
Don't be afraid, for I am with you. Don't be discouraged, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 26:3 (NLT)<br>
You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, all whose thoughts are fixed on you!<br>

<a name="JAH28UHSHAYMD"></a><h2>Confounded</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Confounded<br>
<br>
This is a Bible study where we go to some selected Bible verses in the KJV that mention the word, confound.<br>
<br>
What does the word, confound, mean?<br>
Referring again to the Longman, Chambers, Cambridge, Collins and Oxford Dictionaries,<br>
in January 2022, we went to those online Dictionaries to look at, combine and merge together their word definitions<br>
for the word, confound.<br>
confound, means,<br>
to confuse and surprise people by being unexpected<br>
to prove someone or something wrong<br>
to defeat an enemy, plan etc<br>
to puzzle; to baffle.<br>
to defeat or thwart enemies or their schemes.<br>
to mix up or confuse one thing with another.<br>
to confuse and very much surprise someone, so that they are unable to explain or deal with a situation.<br>
If someone or something confounds you, they make you feel surprised or confused, often by showing you that your opinions or expectations of them were wrong.<br>
to astound or perplex; bewilder<br>
to mix up; confuse<br>
to treat mistakenly as similar to or identical with (one or more other things)<br>
to contradict or refute (an argument, etc)<br>
to rout or defeat (an enemy)<br>
to confuse and surprise<br>
to prove somebody/something wrong<br>
to defeat an enemy<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1:27 (KJV)<br>
but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 1: 26-31 -- NLT<br>
26 Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world's eyes or powerful (or high born) or wealthy when God called you.<br>
<br>
27 Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful.<br>
(God chose those who are low born,)<br>
28 God chose things despised by the world, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important.<br>
29 As a result, no one can ever boast in the presence of God.<br>
30 God has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made him to be wisdom itself. Christ made us right with God; he made us pure and holy, and he freed us from sin.<br>
<br>
31 Therefore, as the Scriptures say, "If you want to boast, boast only about the Lord."<br>
(quoting from Jeremiah 9:24)<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 9: 23 & 24 -- NLT<br>
23<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"Don't let the wise boast in their wisdom,<br>
or the powerful boast in their power,<br>
or the rich boast in their riches.<br>
24<br>
But those who wish to boast<br>
should boast in this alone:<br>
that they truly know me and understand that I am the Lord<br>
who demonstrates unfailing love<br>
and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth,<br>
and that I delight in these things.<br>
I, the Lord, have spoken!<br>

Psalms 22:5 (KJV)<br>
They cried unto thee, and were delivered: They trusted in thee, and were not confounded.<br>
<br>
Psalms 22: 4 & 5 (NLT)<br>
4<br>
Our ancestors trusted in you,<br>
and you rescued them.<br>

Jeremiah 17:18 (KJV)<br>
Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 17: 16-18 (NLT)<br>
...I have not urged you to send disaster.<br>
You have heard everything I've said.<br>
17<br>
Lord, don't terrorise me!<br>
You alone are my hope in the day of disaster.<br>
18<br>
Bring shame and dismay on all who persecute me,<br>
but don't let me experience shame and dismay.<br>
Bring a day of terror on them.<br>
Yes, bring double destruction upon them!<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look up the word, confounded, in The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Strong's Concordance, which is a Bible concordance, an index of every word in the King James Version (KJV), constructed under the direction of James Strong, first published in 1890.<br>
<br>
Also, we will use a second reference book, titled, A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,<br>
which is more commonly known as the Brown-Driver-Briggs or BDB, based on the name of its three authors.<br>
The BDB is a standard reference for Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, first published in the year 1906.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look in the Strong's Hebrew Lexicon,<br>
and the Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions,<br>
for the Hebrew word for, confounded, which is usually the same Hebrew word for, ashamed.<br>
The Hebrew word that gets translated into ashamed and confounded, is pronounced, Boosh.<br>
Boosh is found in the Old Testament 109 times.<br>
it means,<br>
be ashamed<br>
be disappointed<br>
put to shame<br>
to act shamefully<br>
confounded<br>
confusion, brought into confusion<br>
become dry, delay<br>
to delay in shame<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 97:7 (KJV)<br>
Confounded be all they that serve graven images, That boast themselves of idols: Worship him, all ye gods.<br>
<br>
Psalms 97:7 (NLT)<br>
Those who worship idols are disgraced -- all who brag about their worthless gods -- for every god must bow to him.<br>

Psalms 35:4 (KJV)<br>
Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: Let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.<br>
<br>
Psalms 35: 1-10 (NLT)<br>
A psalm of David.<br>
1<br>
O Lord, oppose those who oppose me.<br>
Fight those who fight against me.<br>
2<br>
Put on your armour, and take up your shield.<br>
Prepare for battle, and come to my aid.<br>
3<br>
Lift up your spear and javelin<br>
against those who pursue me.<br>
Let me hear you say,<br>
"I will give you victory!"<br>
4<br>
Bring shame and disgrace on those trying to kill me;<br>
turn them back and humiliate those who want to harm me.<br>
5<br>
Blow them away like chaff in the wind --<br>
a wind sent by the angel of the Lord.<br>
6<br>
Make their path dark and slippery,<br>
with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.<br>
7<br>
I did them no wrong, but they laid a trap for me.<br>
I did them no wrong, but they dug a pit to catch me.<br>
8<br>
So let sudden ruin come upon them!<br>
Let them be caught in the trap they set for me!<br>
Let them be destroyed in the pit they dug for me.<br>
9<br>
Then I will rejoice in the Lord.<br>
I will be glad because he rescues me.<br>
10<br>
With every bone in my body I will praise him:<br>
"Lord, who can compare with you?<br>
Who else rescues the helpless from the strong?<br>
Who else protects the helpless and poor from those who rob them?"<br>
<br>

Psalms 40:14 (KJV)<br>
Let them be ashamed and confounded together That seek after my soul to destroy it; Let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.<br>

<br>
Psalms 40: 13-17 (NLT)<br>
13<br>
Please, Lord, rescue me!<br>
Come quickly, Lord, and help me.<br>
14<br>
May those who try to destroy me<br>
be humiliated and put to shame.<br>
May those who take delight in my trouble<br>
be turned back in disgrace.<br>
15<br>
Let them be horrified by their shame,<br>
for they said, "Aha! We've got him now!"<br>
16<br>
But may all who search for you<br>
be filled with joy and gladness in you.<br>
May those who love your salvation<br>
repeatedly shout, "The Lord is great!"<br>
17<br>
As for me, since I am poor and needy,<br>
let the Lord keep me in his thoughts.<br>
You are my helper and my saviour.<br>
O my God, do not delay.<br>

71:3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.<br>
71:4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.<br>
71:5 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.<br>
71:6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.<br>
71:7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.<br>
71:8 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.<br>
71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.<br>

(they that observe for my soul take counsel together,)<br>

71:12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.<br>
71:13 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.<br>
71:14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.<br>
71:15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.<br>
71:16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.<br>

O Lord, I have come to you for protection;<br>
don't let me be disgraced.<br>
2<br>
Save me and rescue me,<br>
for you do what is right.<br>
Turn your ear to listen to me,<br>

No wonder I am always praising you!<br>
7<br>
My life is an example to many,<br>
because you have been my strength and protection.<br>

That is why I can never stop praising you;<br>
I declare your glory all day long.<br>
9<br>
And now, in my old age, don't set me aside.<br>
Don't abandon me when my strength is failing.<br>
10<br>
For my enemies are whispering against me.<br>
They are plotting together to kill me.<br>
11<br>
They say, "God has abandoned him.<br>
Let's go and get him,<br>
for no one will help him now."<br>
12<br>
O God, don't stay away.<br>
My God, please hurry to help me.<br>
13<br>
Bring disgrace and destruction on my accusers.<br>
Humiliate and shame those who want to harm me.<br>
14<br>
But I will keep on hoping for your help;<br>
I will praise you more and more.<br>
15<br>
I will tell everyone about your righteousness.<br>
All day long I will proclaim your saving power,<br>
though I am not skilled with words.<br>

1 In You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed.<br>
2 In Your righteousness deliver and rescue me; Incline Your ear to me, and save me.<br>
3 Be to me a rock to dwell in, To go into continually. You have given the command to save me, For You are my rock and my stronghold.<br>
4 Rescue me, O my EE-Low-Heem, Out of the hand of the wrong, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel.<br>
5 For You are my expectation, Master Yaw-Who-Wah, my Trust from my youth.<br>
6 Upon You I have leaned from my birth; You took me out of my mother's womb. My praise is continually of You.<br>
7 I have become as a wonder to many, But You are my strong refuge.<br>
8 My mouth is filled with Your praise, Your splendour, all the day.<br>
9 Do not cast me off in the time of old age, When my strength fails, do not forsake me.<br>
10 For my enemies have spoken against me. And those who watch for my life Have taken counsel together,<br>
11 Saying, "EE-Low-Heem has forsaken him; Pursue and take him, for there is no one to deliver."<br>
12 O EE-Low-Heem, do not be far from me; My EE-Low-Heem, hasten to my help!<br>
13 Let those who are adversaries of my life Be ashamed, consumed, Let those who seek my evil Be covered with reproach and confusion.<br>
14 But I continually wait, And shall praise You more and more.<br>
15 My mouth recounts Your righteousness Your deliverance all the day, Though I do not know their numbers.<br>
16 I come in the might of the Master Yaw-Who-Wah; I make mention of Your righteousness, Yours alone.<br>

all day long,<br>

Commentary: Nought is another name for the number zero in England.<br>
Zeros are noughts. Nought point one would be written as a zero, then a dot, then the number one.<br>
The game known in the United States as tic-tac-toe is called noughts and crosses in England, because<br>
in that game, what is known as a letter O in the United States is thought of as a nought, or zero, in England.<br>
I'm sure it is just a coincidence that a zero or nought, in the shape of bread dough, is called a "dough nought".<br>
The spelling for, Nought, is like this, n o u g h t.<br>
It is not the same as the knot spelled with the letter K.<br>
That knot, spelled, k n o t, is what you see in wood, in a hair style, and that knot is what you can do when you tie or twist together shoelaces, or pieces of rope, string or cloth.<br>
So, when we encounter this word, Nought, which is another name for zero, as we will see here in a moment, in Isaiah 41:12, someday, they, the men that war with thee shall be zero.<br>
They that war against thee shall not be successful, especially since we know the number will eventually be brought down to zero.<br>
The men of thy strife, the men of thy contention, the men of thy war, shall perish, shall someday be zero.<br>
Where are your accusers now? Watch the number dwindle down to zero before your eyes, as your Messiah writes about them in the dust, in the ground.<br>
Whatever is written in the ground, in the dust, is very temporary, and will soon be forgotten.<br>
<br>
John 8: 8-12 (TS2009)<br>
8 And bending down again, He wrote on the ground.<br>
9 And when they heard it, being reproved by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the older ones until the last. And Yaw-Who-Shaw was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.<br>
10 And Yaw-Who-Shaw, straightening up and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, "Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Did no one condemn you?"<br>
11 And she said, "No one, Master." And Yaw-Who-Shaw said to her, "Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more."<br>
12 Therefore Yaw-Who-Shaw spoke to them again, saying, "I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but possess the light of life."<br>
<br>
<br>
(Romans) 8:1 (TS2009)<br>
There is, then, now no condemnation to those who are in Messiah Yaw-Who-Shaw, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 41: 8-13 (KJV)<br>
41:8 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.<br>
41:9 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.<br>
41:10 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.<br>
41:11 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing;<br>
(and the men of thy strife shall perish.)<br>
and they that strive with thee shall perish.<br>
41:12 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.<br>
(Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even the men of thy contention: the men of thy war shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.)<br>
41:13 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.<br>

Isaiah 41: 8-13 (NLT)<br>
8<br>
"But as for you, Israel my servant,<br>
Jacob my chosen one,<br>
descended from Abraham my friend,<br>
9<br>
I have called you back from the ends of the earth,<br>
saying, 'You are my servant.'<br>
For I have chosen you<br>
and will not throw you away.<br>
10<br>
Don't be afraid, for I am with you.<br>
Don't be discouraged, for I am your God.<br>
I will strengthen you and help you.<br>
I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.<br>
11<br>
"See, all your angry enemies lie there,<br>
confused and humiliated.<br>
Anyone who opposes you will die<br>
and come to nothing.<br>
12<br>
You will look in vain<br>
for those who tried to conquer you.<br>
Those who attack you<br>
will come to nothing.<br>
13<br>
For I hold you by your right hand --<br>
I, the Lord your God.<br>
And I say to you,<br>
'Don't be afraid. I am here to help you.<br>

These idols have no breath or power.<br>

But (the Portion of Jacob,) the God of Israel is no idol!<br>

45<br>
"Come out, my people, flee from Babylon.<br>
Save yourselves! Run from the Lord's fierce anger.<br>
46<br>
But do not panic; don't be afraid<br>
when you hear the first rumour of approaching forces.<br>
For rumours will keep coming year by year.<br>
Violence will erupt in the land<br>
as the leaders fight against each other.<br>
47<br>
For the time is surely coming<br>
when I will punish this great city and all her idols.<br>
Her whole land will be disgraced,<br>
and her dead will lie in the streets.<br>
48<br>
Then the heavens and earth will rejoice,<br>
for out of the north will come destroying armies<br>
against Babylon," says the Lord.<br>
49<br>
"Just as Babylon killed the people of Israel<br>
and others throughout the world,<br>
so must her people be killed.<br>
50<br>
Get out, all you who have escaped the sword!<br>
Do not stand and watch -- flee while you can!<br>
Remember the Lord, though you are in a far-off land,<br>
and think about your home in Jerusalem."<br>
51<br>
"We are ashamed," the people say.<br>
"We are insulted and disgraced<br>
because the Lord's Temple<br>
has been defiled by foreigners."<br>
52<br>
"Yes," says the Lord, "but the time is coming<br>
when I will destroy Babylon's idols.<br>
The groans of her wounded people<br>
will be heard throughout the land.<br>

Though Babylon reaches as high as the heavens<br>
and makes her fortifications incredibly strong,<br>
I will still send enemies to plunder her.<br>

Micah 3: 5-8 (KJV)<br>
3:5 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.<br>
3:6 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.<br>
(Therefore night shall be unto you, from a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, from divining; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.)<br>
3:7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, (they shall all cover their upper lip) they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.<br>
3:8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgement, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 3: 5-8 (NLT)<br>
5<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"You false prophets are leading my people astray!<br>
You promise peace for those who give you food,<br>
but you declare war on those who refuse to feed you.<br>
6<br>
Now the night will close around you,<br>
cutting off all your visions.<br>
Darkness will cover you,<br>
putting an end to your predictions.<br>
The sun will set for you prophets,<br>
and your day will come to an end.<br>
7<br>
Then you seers will be put to shame,<br>
and you fortune-tellers will be disgraced.<br>
And you will cover your faces<br>
because there is no answer from God."<br>
8<br>
But as for me, I am filled with power --<br>
with the Spirit of the Lord.<br>
(the wind, the breath, the Roo-Awk of Yaw-Who-Wah)<br>
I am filled with justice and strength<br>
to boldly declare Israel's sin and rebellion.<br>

15<br>
"Yes," says the Lord,<br>
"I will do mighty miracles for you,<br>
like those I did when I rescued you<br>
from slavery in Egypt."<br>
16<br>
All the nations of the world will stand amazed<br>
at what the Lord will do for you.<br>
They will be embarrassed<br>
at their feeble power.<br>
They will cover their mouths in silent awe,<br>
deaf to everything around them.<br>
17<br>
Like snakes crawling from their holes,<br>
they will come out to meet the Lord our God.<br>
They will fear him greatly,<br>
trembling in terror at his presence.<br>

15 "As in the days when you came out of (the world) the land of Egypt (the land of Meets-Rye-EEm), I shall let him see wonders."<br>
16 Let the nations see and be ashamed of all their might, let them put their hand over their mouth, let their ears be deaf.<br>
17 Let them lick the dust like a serpent, let them come trembling from their strongholds like snakes of the earth, let them be afraid of Yaw-Who-Wah our EE-Low-Heem and fear because of You.<br>
18 Who is an EE-Low-Heem like You -- taking away crookedness and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance?...<br>

(Deuteronomy) 8:3 (TS2009)<br>

<br>
<br>
Commentary: How do you live forever?<br>
How do you get eternal life?<br>
<br>
Not by bread alone, but you live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God.<br>
What does that mean?  It sounds like a riddle! Here is an idea to consider. Maybe this is the answer to the riddle.<br>
The bread is the bread of life, which is Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw. To receive and eat that bread would be to believe and receive the New Testament, the new Covenant, the bread, broken for you.<br>
<br>
Every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, that would be when God spoke and gave us the commandments in the Old Testament, the Torah, and Moses wrote them down.  Look closely at the Hebrew language, and you will see that The Ten Commandments are also known as the Ten Words. It says, every word, that would be each and every commandment, as in, all of the commandments, not some, not half, not most, but all commandments. Obey every commandment, every single word of them.<br>
<br>
Put these two together, the bread of life, and every word came out of the mouth of God, and live.<br>
The living bread of life points to the New Testament, and the word of God, the commandments of EE-Low-Heem, that points to the Old Testament, the Old Covenant.<br>
<br>
Your relationship with the Heavenly Father, Yaw-Who-Wah, is like a marriage relationship, not of the human, physical, gender kind, but of a spiritual kind.<br>
<br>
The New Testament is getting married, and the Old Testament tells you how to stay successfully married.<br>
<br>
If you only read and obey the Old Testament and you ignore the New Testament, that is like doing the boyfriend-girlfriend dating relationship, but you are not technically or legally married. You act like you are, you pretend like you are, but you're not. You can pretend, and do sexual activity like a married couple, and share your time, your decisions, and your finances, but you are still not married. It's like someone who rejects Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, and all they do is try to obey the commandments in the Old Testament Torah.  Doing all of that, without Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, will not get you into heaven. It's also like perfectly obeying all of the traffic laws, but never getting a legal licence to drive.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other people like to read and obey the New Testament and ignore the Old Testament.  That is like actually getting married, and then staying exactly the same, and living your life like you never got married, even though you point to the marriage license, John 3:16 and Romans 10:9, telling everyone you are married, but you refuse to let the marriage change you in any way.  Let's say, as a man, before you were married, you always went out drinking with the guys for hours at night, then you spend your Saturdays, spending hours watching porn and playing video games, then you spend hours on Sunday doing nothing but watching football.  Then you get married, and you keep doing that?<br>
<br>
Or let's say, as a woman, when you were single, you spent hours doing the most amazing dance moves on the discotheque dance floor at the local nightclub, flirting with every hot guy.  Then, you get married, and before you know it, here is your baby crying because its nappy (its diaper) needs changing, but you're too busy dancing and texting all your guy friends?  Does that sound like a marriage that's going to last?  Believing in Jesus and then staying exactly the same, ignoring all of His commandments? A new heart I will give you? No, thanks. Be transformed by the renewing of you mind? Not now. I'm too busy making my next Tik Tok video of me doing sexy dancing whilst the baby keeps crying? That's like getting your legal licence to drive, but then you continue ignoring all traffic laws in the driver's manual. What? Actually stop at a red traffic light or stop sign?  I'm supposed to drive on the right side of the road in the United States? I'm saved and forgiven, I'm under grace, I'm not under the law. If I ignore and forget and disobey all traffic laws in the driver's manual, the Torah, the Bible, how soon will I crash and die?<br>
<br>
Getting a driving licence is one thing, but continuing to obey the traffic laws in the driver's manual, is what makes your driving successful.<br>
<br>
Getting married is one thing, but staying married is what makes a marriage be successful.  Getting married is New Testament believing in and receiving the Messiah, the Muh-She-Awk, and staying married, is Old Testament, Torah Commandment Obedience.  Those verses that we just looked at, they tell us that He lives in you, dwells in you, and causes you to obey his commandments, by fixing your heart and transforming your mind.<br>
<br>
Since the first shall be last and the last shall be first, eat the bread, then eat the scroll and live. Receive the New Testament, and obey the Old Testament, and live. Receive the bread of life, and obey every word that proceeded out of the mouth of Elohim, and live, forever. Receive the Messiah and obey the Torah, and live, forever. You can't live by bread alone. Get both, read, study, pray, receive, believe, follow, trust, obey, forgive, and live.<br>
<br>

Go look in a mirror and think about this...<br>

...Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.<br>

Proverbs 29:18 (KJV)<br>
(Where there is no vision, the people is made naked)<br>
Where there is no vision, the people perish: But he that keepeth the law, happy is he.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 29:18 (NLT)<br>
When people do not accept divine guidance, they run wild. But whoever obeys the law is joyful.<br>
<br>

Where there is no vision, the people are let loose, But blessed is he who guards the Torah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 2:3 (KJV)<br>
For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 2:3 (NLT)<br>
This vision is for a future time. It describes the end, and it will be fulfilled. If it seems slow in coming, wait patiently, for it will surely take place. It will not be delayed.<br>
<br>
<br>

Do we then nullify the Torah through the belief? Let it not be! On the contrary, we establish the Torah.<br>

For not the hearers of the Torah are righteous in the sight of Elohim, but the doers of the Torah shall be declared right.<br>

The Torah of his Elohim is in his heart; His steps do not slide.<br>
