This is an electronic version of a Christian Church Service. This is a Bible Study, where we study and learn about our Father in Heaven, our Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty, Holy God, Messiah, Lord, Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Because we study the entire Bible, including all of the Old Testament, and all of the New Testament, praying in the name of Jesus Christ, in the name of Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, Yeh-Shew-Uh, the following warning may be applicable on some occasions.<br>
<br>
Warning. Discretion is advised.<br>
The Bible verses that we read, and the comments and opinions shared, may not be appropriate for all audiences.<br>
Non-Christian audiences may be offended.<br>

Some content is intended only for mature Christians.<br>
Some of this content may sometimes be inappropriate, objectionable or offensive to non-Christians, or audiences of other religions.<br>
Some studies may possibly contain, mature subject matter, Adult Content, offensive content, sexually explicit content, and explicit content that may be disturbing or upsetting, especially for children and non-Christians.<br>
Some studies may contain opinions, comments and views that are in opposition to other religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
Warning!<br>
Some parts of the Bible contain mature subject matter, adult themes, strong adult content and sexual content that may not be suitable for young children.<br>
Some people may find Bible studies to be offensive, and those people may respond with legal persecutions, including lawsuits, or illegal, criminal actions.<br>
Caution. Christians meeting together, and gathering together as a group of people, Bible ownership, Bible reading, and Christian Church services may be illegal in certain areas, possibly resulting in arrest, torture, imprisonment or death.<br>

<br>
This is an English Bible study, with readings from English Bibles.<br>
We may sometimes attempt to pray and speak the name of the Heavenly Father and His only begotten Son in the original, ancient Hebrew language.<br>
We usually like to read verses from the King James Version (KJV) (1611), and the fifth edition of the New Living Translation (NLT) (2015).<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
Jumping Jehoshaphat and False Prophets<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When church attendance keeps going down, what's a church to do?<br>
Preach the truth, and read the entire Bible out loud to the congregation?<br>
Hell, No! Turn the place into a carnival or amusement park!<br>
<br>
A helter-skelter is a tall structure in a fairground in which you sit on it, at the top, and slide round and round, down to the bottom.  It's a spiral slide down the outside of a tower in a fairground or playground.<br>
<br>
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported on 9 August 2019 that a helter-skelter had been installed in the nave of the Norwich Cathedral in Rochester, about 30 miles east of London.<br>
The nave is the long, main central inside part of a church building.<br>
They took all the benches and seats out, and they put this tower spiral slide, helter-skelter in the front stage area, and where all the benches and seats used to be, they replaced it all with an indoor, miniature nine-hole Golf course.<br>
<br>
Do you remember the four main things that the original Christian church did, which is the definition of a Christian church service? Do you remember what the original Christian church service did, as it was originally documented in the book of Acts?<br>
This is not it!<br>
<br>
It makes sense.  Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.  Jesus is the truth.  If you want to follow and obey Jesus, then you will want to know and do the truth.  The Bible is perfect and true.  Since these are all qualities and characteristics of Jesus and God, it would make sense that, if you hate and reject Jesus, then you would also hate and reject all of these other qualities and characteristics found in Jesus.  So, if you hate and reject Jesus, the truth, then, naturally you would hate and reject the truth, and you would much rather enjoy believing a lie.  Do we really do that?  Do we enjoy feeding ourselves with lies?<br>
<br>
What is entering into you that is true, and what is entering into you that is a lie? Video games are a lie.  That video game world does not actually exist, you do not really look like that, and you do not really have those powers and abilities, and you do not really have those things.  All of those objects that you think you own in that video game do not actually exist in this three-dimensional world.<br>
<br>
Movies, films and TV shows mainly are all lies.  People are acting like God, creating worlds and virtual, computer-generated realities that are lies, people and characters that do not really exist, and controlling everything that happens to them in the story manufactured by human minds, human hearts and human imaginations.<br>
<br>
Unless we repent, we may see that most people, in general, are determined to stay evil, loving fictional lies, along with also loving pretty, positive, encouraging motivational stories with a moral, stories involving computer-generated, talking animals which teach a moral lesson, but the stories never actually, really happened. I am including myself, here, when I say that we love myths and legends, fictitious tales, the Star Wars galaxy, Middle Earth, Narnia, the super heroes from comic books, or rather, graphic novels, with an emphasis on the word, novel, which is fiction. We love to create or invent something or relate to something as if it were true, but is just a manufactured lie coming out of the imagination, heart and mind of man, and not of God.<br>
<br>
We say we're Christian, but how many hours do we spend each day feeding our eyes and ears, hearts and minds, and soul with fictional streaming videos, movies, TV shows and video game worlds that are just lies of fiction?  Going to a church building to slide down a helter-skelter and play crazy golf, it does not feed our souls and spirits with the Way, the truth and the life, but sure feels good and is lots of fun!<br>
<br>
There is a very interesting difference in the attitude and the way how people think and talk, when you compare those who want the truth, and those that would rather just feed themselves with lies.  Don't read the Bible which is true.  Tell me a lie that will make me happy and feel good.  Play music that has no clear message of truth, just play something happy that will make me want to dance.<br>
<br>
This difference between followers of God, wanting the truth, and followers of selfishness, sin and satan, wanting only happy, pretty lies of fiction, can be clearly experienced when we look at the interactions and conversations between the obedient truthers and believers of the Lord God, and the False Prophets.  In this Bible study, we will look at an interesting story about these False Prophets, over in 2 Chronicles 18, and then that story is also told in 1 Kings 22.  Then, since we are right next to an amazing story about King Jehoshaphat, we'll look at that, and then we will finish up with one final talk about False Prophets in the book of Micah chapter 2.<br>
<br>
Let's begin with a prayer, saying his name in English and in Hebrew. Let's pray right now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Lord, Jesus Christ, Dear Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw,<br>
Help me walk in obedience according to your word, according to your will, and according to your holy spirit.<br>
Help me walk in obedience to your Torah, your entire Bible, your word, and your Scriptures and commandments.<br>
Help me walk bravely in your will.<br>
Help me go forth in your name and be bold, brave, courageous, and filled with a good courage.<br>
Help me hide myself where you say is safe to hide.<br>
Help me walk in obedience to your good wisdom from above.<br>
Help me walk in obedience to your Holy Spirit, your Spirit that is Holy, your Hawk-Oh-Desh, Roo-Awk, your Roo-Awk, Hawk-Oh-Desh.<br>
Help me walk through the valley of the shadow of death, fearing no evil because you are with me, comforting me.<br>
Help me have a free will that freely follows your good, pleasing and perfect will, and let me always have strong eyes, ears, and a heart, mind and soul that is guided by and commanded by you, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
May I continually receive your good wisdom, knowledge, guidance, understanding, skill, and your piloting and your direction in everything that I think, say and do, and everywhere I go, and with everyone that I meet and interact with.<br>
Help me, save me, bless me, guide me and protect me, and deliver me from all evil, all trouble, all suffering and all persecution, and all tribulation.<br>
Thank you for your righteousness, your salvation, your forgiveness, your compassion, your mercy, your grace, your lovingkindness, and your perfect love.  Create in me what I am missing or lacking, and cast out of me any kind of thing that is wrong and does not belong in me.<br>
Hide me, protect me, deliver me, and provide for me all that I need. Guide me into all truth, your way, your light and your life.<br>
Don't let us try to rest where it is not safe to rest.  Instead, guide us and lead us to where we can rest and be in safety, protection and security, with abundant provision, physical and spiritual prosperity and good fellowship filled with your truth and your word.<br>
Let us not be deceived with those that are secretly in opposition to you, with those who have replaced your truth and your commandments with human traditions, human customs, and human rituals that are not in the Bible.<br>
Let me not be deceived, let me not be afraid, help me fear not, fill me with your power, your love and give me a sound mind, a new, clean heart, a healed body and an uplifted soul.<br>
Heal me, remodel me, and transform me. Strengthen me, open my eyes so that I have eyes to see, heal and bless my hearing so that I may hear what the Spirit is saying. Lead me by your holy spirit.  I thank you for your love and your peace, Strengthen us now with the Spirit of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, with the total presence of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, and with the glory of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
In Jesus name, in the name of Jesus Christ, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main, Amen. Hallelujah!<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 119:101 (NLT)<br>
I have refused to walk on any evil path, so that I may remain obedient to your word.<br>
<br>
Judges 2:17 (NLT)<br>
Yet Israel did not listen to the judges but prostituted themselves by worshipping other gods. How quickly they turned away from the path of their ancestors, who had walked in obedience to the Lord's commands.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 29:18 (KJV)<br>
Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 29:18 (NLT)<br>
When people do not accept divine guidance, they run wild. But whoever obeys the law is joyful.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:3 (KJV)<br>
Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:3 (NLT)<br>
Commit your actions to the Lord, and your plans will succeed.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:9 (KJV)<br>
A man's heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 16:9 (NLT)<br>
We can make our plans, but the Lord determines our steps.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4:23 (KJV)<br>
Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4:23 (NLT)<br>
Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 2:11 (KJV)<br>
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 2: 10-12 NLT<br>
...they refuse to love and accept the truth that would save them.<br>
11 So God will cause them to be greatly deceived, and they will believe these lies.<br>
12 Then they will be condemned for enjoying evil rather than believing the truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 4: 3 & 4 KJV<br>
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;<br>
4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 4: 2-5 NLT<br>
2 Preach the word of God. Be prepared, whether the time is favourable or not. Patiently correct, rebuke, and encourage your people with good teaching.<br>
3 For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching. They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear.<br>
4 They will reject the truth and chase after myths.<br>
5 But you should keep a clear mind in every situation. Don't be afraid of suffering for the Lord. Work at telling others the Good News, and fully carry out the ministry God has given you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 14:14 (KJV)<br>
Then the Lord said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 14:14 (NLT)<br>
Then the Lord said, "These prophets are telling lies in my name. I did not send them or tell them to speak. I did not give them any messages. They prophesy of visions and revelations they have never seen or heard. They speak foolishness made up in their own lying hearts.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a sample of something that we will be looking at later on...<br>
Micah 2:10 (KJV)<br>
Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You may find yourself thinking about and remembering these Bible verses as we read our stories about Jehoshaphat and the False Prophets...<br>
<br>

2 Corinthians 6:14 (KJV)<br>
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 6:14 (NLT)<br>
Don't team up with those who are unbelievers. How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness?<br>
<br>
If you want to get a glimpse of what 2 Corinthians 6:14 might look like, just look at the story of King Jehoshaphat.<br>
We probably have the expression, Jumping Jehoshaphat, because King Jehoshaphat kept jumping in and out of evil relationships with evil people, trying to be unequally yoked together with unbelievers, trying to team up with those who are unbelievers, in politics and in business.<br>
In your financial and business matters, are you trying to do the same thing?<br>

The original Hebrew or Greek meanings are considered and placed inside round brackets.<br>
When I read these stories to you out loud, and you hear me repeat a verse again, but with a slightly different choice of words,<br>
that is just us trying to look at the original Hebrew meanings in the Old Testament, or the original Greek meanings in the New Testament.<br>

2 Chronicles 18:1, KJV<br>
we will read the entire chapter 18, all 34 verses, and we will keep reading<br>
right into a little bit of chapter 19, stopping when we get to<br>
2 Chronicles 19, verse 7, KJV<br>
<br>
1 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.<br>
<br>
2 And (at the end of years,) after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth -- gilead.<br>
<br>
3 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth -- gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.<br>
4 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the Lord to day.<br>
5 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth -- gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.<br>
<br>
6<br>
But Jehoshaphat said,<br>
(Is there not here a prophet of the Lord yet,)<br>
(Is there not here a prophet of the Lord more,)<br>
Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might enquire of him?<br>
<br>
<br>
7 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the Lord: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.<br>
<br>
(And the king of Israel called for one of his eunuchs, and said, Hasten quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.)<br>
8 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes,<br>
(and they sat in a floor at the entering in of the gate of Samaria)<br>
and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.<br>
<br>
<br>
10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the Lord,<br>
(With these thou shalt push Syria until thou consume them.)<br>
With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.<br>
<br>
<br>
11 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth -- gilead, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.<br>
<br>
<br>
12 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent;<br>
(Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth;)<br>
let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.<br>
<br>
<br>
13 And Micaiah said, As the Lord liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.<br>
14 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth -- gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.<br>
15 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the Lord?<br>
16 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,<br>
(Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but for evil?)<br>
Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?<br>
<br>
<br>
18 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the Lord; I saw the Lord sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.<br>
19 And the Lord said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth -- gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.<br>
20 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will entice him. And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith?<br>
21 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.<br>
22 Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee.<br>
23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee?<br>
<br>
<br>
24 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.<br>
(Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself.)<br>
(Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into a chamber in a chamber to hide thyself.)<br>
<br>
25 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;<br>
26 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.<br>
27 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the Lord spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.<br>
28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth -- gilead.<br>
29 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.<br>
30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.<br>
31 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.<br>
<br>
<br>
32 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel,<br>
they turned back again from pursuing him.<br>
(they turned back again from after him.)<br>
<br>
(And a certain man drew a bow in his simplicity, and smote the king of Israel between the joints and between the breastplate: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am made sick.)<br>
33 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
34 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.<br>
1 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.<br>
2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord.<br>
3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.<br>
<br>
<br>
4 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem:<br>
(and he returned and went out again through the people from Beer -- sheba to mount Ephraim,)<br>
and he went out again through the people from Beer -- sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the Lord God of their fathers.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,<br>
<br>
<br>
6 And said to the judges,<br>
(Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the matter of judgement.)<br>
Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgement.<br>
<br>
<br>
7 Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.<br>

2 Chronicles 18:1, NLT<br>
we will read the entire chapter 18, all 34 verses, and we will keep reading<br>
right into a little bit of chapter 19, stopping when we get to<br>
2 Chronicles 19, verse 7, NLT<br>
<br>
1 Jehoshaphat enjoyed great riches and high esteem, and he made an alliance with Ahab of Israel by having his son marry Ahab's daughter.<br>
2 A few years later he went to Samaria to visit Ahab, who prepared a great banquet for him and his officials. They butchered great numbers of sheep, goats, and cattle for the feast. Then Ahab enticed Jehoshaphat to join forces with him to recover Ramoth-gilead.<br>
3<br>
"Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?" King Ahab of Israel asked King Jehoshaphat of Judah.<br>
Jehoshaphat replied, "Why, of course! You and I are as one, and my troops are your troops. We will certainly join you in battle."<br>
4 Then Jehoshaphat added, "But first let's find out what the Lord says."<br>
5<br>
So the king of Israel summoned the prophets, 400 of them, and asked them, "Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold back?"<br>
They all replied, "Yes, go right ahead! God will give the king victory."<br>
6 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not also a prophet of the Lord here? We should ask him the same question."<br>
7<br>
The king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, "There is one more man who could consult the Lord for us, but I hate him. He never prophesies anything but trouble for me! His name is Micaiah son of Imlah."<br>
Jehoshaphat replied, "That's not the way a king should talk! Let's hear what he has to say."<br>
8<br>
So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Quick! Bring Micaiah son of Imlah."<br>
9 King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on thrones at the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria. All of Ahab's prophets were prophesying there in front of them.<br>
10 One of them, Zedekiah son of Kenaanah, made some iron horns and proclaimed, "This is what the Lord says: With these horns you will gore the Arameans to death!"<br>
11 All the other prophets agreed. "Yes," they said, "go up to Ramoth-gilead and be victorious, for the Lord will give the king victory!"<br>
12 Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him, "Look, all the prophets are promising victory for the king. Be sure that you agree with them and promise success."<br>
13 But Micaiah replied, "As surely as the Lord lives, I will say only what my God says."<br>
14<br>
When Micaiah arrived before the king, Ahab asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold back?"<br>
Micaiah replied sarcastically, "Yes, go up and be victorious, for you will have victory over them!"<br>
15 But the king replied sharply, "How many times must I demand that you speak only the truth to me when you speak for the Lord?"<br>
16<br>
Then Micaiah told him, "In a vision I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said,<br>
(These people have no master.)<br>
'Their master has been killed. Send them home in peace.'"<br>
<br>
17 "Didn't I tell you?" the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat. "He never prophesies anything but trouble for me."<br>
18<br>
Then Micaiah continued, "Listen to what the Lord says! I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the armies of heaven around him, on his right and on his left.<br>
19<br>
And the Lord said, 'Who can entice King Ahab of Israel to go into battle against Ramoth-gilead so he can be killed?'<br>
"There were many suggestions,<br>
20<br>
and finally a spirit approached the Lord and said, 'I can do it!'<br>
"'How will you do this?' the Lord asked.<br>
21<br>
"And the spirit replied, 'I will go out and inspire all of Ahab's prophets to speak lies.'<br>
"'You will succeed,' said the Lord. 'Go ahead and do it.'<br>
22 "So you see, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of your prophets. For the Lord has pronounced your doom."<br>
23 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face. "Since when did the Spirit of the Lord leave me to speak to you?" he demanded.<br>
24 And Micaiah replied, "You will find out soon enough when you are trying to hide in some secret room!"<br>
25 "Arrest him!" the king of Israel ordered. "Take him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to my son Joash.<br>
26 Give them this order from the king: 'Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return safely from the battle!'"<br>
27 But Micaiah replied, "If you return safely, it will mean that the Lord has not spoken through me!" Then he added to those standing around, "Everyone mark my words!"<br>
28 So King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah led their armies against Ramoth-gilead.<br>
29 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "As we go into battle, I will disguise myself so no one will recognise me, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.<br>
30 Meanwhile, the king of Aram had issued these orders to his chariot commanders: "Attack only the king of Israel! Don't bother with anyone else."<br>
31 So when the Aramean chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they went after him. "There is the king of Israel!" they shouted. But Jehoshaphat called out, and the Lord saved him. God helped him by turning the attackers away from him.<br>
32 As soon as the chariot commanders realised he was not the king of Israel, they stopped chasing him.<br>
33<br>
An Aramean soldier, however, randomly shot an arrow at the Israelite troops and hit the king of Israel between the joints of his armour.<br>
"(Turn your hand,) Turn the horses and get me out of here!" Ahab groaned to the driver of the chariot. "I'm badly wounded!"<br>
<br>
34 The battle raged all that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans. In the evening, just as the sun was setting, he died.<br>
1 When King Jehoshaphat of Judah arrived safely home in Jerusalem,<br>
2 Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him. "Why should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord?" he asked the king. "Because of what you have done, the Lord is very angry with you.<br>
3 Even so, there is some good in you, for you have removed the Asherah poles throughout the land, and you have committed yourself to seeking God."<br>
4 Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, but he went out among the people, travelling from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, encouraging the people to return to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.<br>
5 He appointed judges throughout the nation in all the fortified towns,<br>
6 and he said to them, "Always think carefully before pronouncing judgement. Remember that you do not judge to please people but to please the Lord. He will be with you when you render the verdict in each case.<br>
7 Fear the Lord and judge with integrity, for the Lord our God does not tolerate perverted justice, partiality, or the taking of bribes."<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel is most likely the Book of Kings, which is now split into two volumes.<br>
Today, the first half is 1 Kings, and the second half is 2 Kings, which we still have in our Bibles today.<br>
<br>
The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah, also known as, Chronicles of the Kings of Judah,<br>
is not in our Bibles anymore.  It is lost and no longer exists, as far as we know.<br>
<br>
We used to have many more books in our Bible, maybe even over 100 originally.<br>
They have been lost, removed or destroyed over the history of time, perhaps by accident or negligence, or on purpose, and today, we just have 66 books in our Bible.<br>
These lost books, what few copies we have left, may be fake, or may be bad translations, or may be corrupt, incomplete fragments, and they can't be generally trusted.<br>
There are, however, some of these lost books that might still be worth reading, and should be cautiously evaluated and considered.<br>
Because of these additional, lost books, this is why we sometimes read things, like in John 7:38, when he says, For the Scriptures declare, and yet, what John quotes right there cannot be found anywhere else in the Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
The story we read just read a moment ago, in 2 Chronicles, is also in the book of 1 Kings 22.<br>
Let's read it next, because it mentions some additional scenes and details not recorded in 2 Chronicles.<br>
The split between 1 Kings and 2 Kings is right after this chapter 22, which is the last chapter of 1 Kings.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Kings 22. This chapter has 53 verses, but we are not reading the entire chapter.<br>
We will just read to verse 48.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Kings 22: verses 1 through 48 -- KJV<br>
1 And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.<br>
2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
3 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours,<br>
(and we be silent from taking it,)<br>
and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?<br>
<br>
<br>
4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth -- gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.<br>
5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the Lord to day.<br>
6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth -- gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.<br>
7 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might enquire of him?<br>
8 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the Lord: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.<br>
<br>
(Then the king of Israel called a eunuch,)<br>
9 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.<br>
<br>
<br>
10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes,<br>
(in a floor place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria;)<br>
in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.<br>
<br>
<br>
11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the Lord, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.<br>
12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth -- gilead, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the king's hand.<br>
13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.<br>
14 And Micaiah said, As the Lord liveth, what the Lord saith unto me, that will I speak.<br>
15 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth -- gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.<br>
16 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord?<br>
17 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.<br>
18 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?<br>
19 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.<br>
<br>
<br>
20 And the Lord said,<br>
(Who shall deceive Ahab,)<br>
Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth -- gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.<br>
<br>
<br>
21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him.<br>
22 And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.<br>
23 Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee.<br>
24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee?<br>
<br>
<br>
25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day,<br>
(when thou shalt go into a chamber in a chamber to hide thyself.)<br>
when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.<br>
<br>
<br>
26 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;<br>
27 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.<br>
28 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.<br>
29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth -- gilead.<br>
<br>
(And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat when he was to disguise himself, and enter into the battle;)<br>
30 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.<br>
32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.<br>
33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.<br>
<br>
(And a certain man drew a bow in his simplicity, and smote the king of Israel between the joints and the breastplate: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am made sick.)<br>
34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.<br>
<br>
(And the battle ascended that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the bosom of the chariot.)<br>
35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.<br>
<br>
<br>
36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.<br>
<br>
<br>
37 So the king died, (and came to Samaria) and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.<br>
<br>
<br>
38 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the Lord which he spake.<br>
39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<br>
40 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.<br>
41 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.<br>
42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.<br>
43 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.<br>
44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.<br>
45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?<br>
46 And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.<br>
47 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.<br>
<br>
<br>
48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish<br>
(Jehoshaphat had ten ships of Tarshish) to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion -- geber.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Kings 22: verses 1 through 48 -- NLT<br>
1 For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.<br>
2 Then during the third year, King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit King Ahab of Israel.<br>
3 During the visit, the king of Israel said to his officials, "Do you realise that the town of Ramoth-gilead belongs to us? And yet we've done nothing to recapture it from the king of Aram!"<br>
4<br>
Then he turned to Jehoshaphat and asked, "Will you join me in battle to recover Ramoth-gilead?"<br>
Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "Why, of course! You and I are as one. My troops are your troops, and my horses are your horses."<br>
5<br>
Then Jehoshaphat added, "But first let's find out what the Lord says."<br>
6<br>
So the king of Israel summoned the prophets, about 400 of them, and asked them, "Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold back?"<br>
They all replied, "Yes, go right ahead! The Lord will give the king victory."<br>
7<br>
But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not also a prophet of the Lord here? We should ask him the same question."<br>
8<br>
The king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, "There is one more man who could consult the Lord for us, but I hate him. He never prophesies anything but trouble for me! His name is Micaiah son of Imlah."<br>
Jehoshaphat replied, "That's not the way a king should talk! Let's hear what he has to say."<br>
9<br>
So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Quick! Bring Micaiah son of Imlah."<br>
10 King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on thrones at the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria. All of Ahab's prophets were prophesying there in front of them.<br>
11 One of them, Zedekiah son of Kenaanah, made some iron horns and proclaimed, "This is what the Lord says: With these horns you will gore the Arameans to death!"<br>
12 All the other prophets agreed. "Yes," they said, "go up to Ramoth-gilead and be victorious, for the Lord will give the king victory!"<br>
13 Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him, "Look, all the prophets are promising victory for the king. Be sure that you agree with them and promise success."<br>
14 But Micaiah replied, "As surely as the Lord lives, I will say only what the Lord tells me to say."<br>
15<br>
When Micaiah arrived before the king, Ahab asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we hold back?"<br>
Micaiah replied sarcastically, "Yes, go up and be victorious, for the Lord will give the king victory!"<br>
16 But the king replied sharply, "How many times must I demand that you speak only the truth to me when you speak for the Lord?"<br>
<br>
<br>
17 Then Micaiah told him, "In a vision I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd.<br>
And the Lord said, (These people have no master.) 'Their master has been killed. Send them home in peace.'"<br>
<br>
<br>
18<br>
"Didn't I tell you?" the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat. "He never prophesies anything but trouble for me."<br>
19<br>
Then Micaiah continued, "Listen to what the Lord says! I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the armies of heaven around him, on his right and on his left.<br>
20<br>
And the Lord said, 'Who can entice Ahab to go into battle against Ramoth-gilead so he can be killed?'<br>
"There were many suggestions,<br>
21<br>
and finally a spirit approached the Lord and said, 'I can do it!'<br>
22<br>
"'How will you do this?' the Lord asked.<br>
"And the spirit replied, 'I will go out and inspire all of Ahab's prophets to speak lies.'<br>
"'You will succeed,' said the Lord. 'Go ahead and do it.'<br>
23 "So you see, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all your prophets. For the Lord has pronounced your doom."<br>
24 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face. "Since when did the Spirit of the Lord leave me to speak to you?" he demanded.<br>
25 And Micaiah replied, "You will find out soon enough when you are trying to hide in some secret room!"<br>
26 "Arrest him!" the king of Israel ordered. "Take him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to my son Joash.<br>
27 Give them this order from the king: 'Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return safely from the battle!'"<br>
28 But Micaiah replied, "If you return safely, it will mean that the Lord has not spoken through me!" Then he added to those standing around, "Everyone mark my words!"<br>
29 So King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah led their armies against Ramoth-gilead.<br>
30 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "As we go into battle, I will disguise myself so no one will recognise me, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.<br>
31 Meanwhile, the king of Aram had issued these orders to his thirty-two chariot commanders: "Attack only the king of Israel. Don't bother with anyone else!"<br>
32 So when the Aramean chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they went after him. "There is the king of Israel!" they shouted. But when Jehoshaphat called out,<br>
33 the chariot commanders realised he was not the king of Israel, and they stopped chasing him.<br>
<br>
<br>
34 An Aramean soldier, however, randomly shot an arrow at the Israelite troops and hit the king of Israel between the joints of his armour.<br>
(Turn your hand and get me out of here!)<br>
"Turn the horses and get me out of here!" Ahab groaned to the driver of his chariot. "I'm badly wounded!"<br>
<br>
<br>
35 The battle raged all that day, and the king remained propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran down to the floor of his chariot, and as evening arrived he died.<br>
36 Just as the sun was setting, the cry ran through his troops: "We're done for! Run for your lives!"<br>
37 So the king died, and his body was taken to Samaria and buried there.<br>
<br>
<br>
38 Then his chariot was washed beside the pool of Samaria,<br>
(and dogs came and licked his blood, and the prostitutes bathed in it at the place where the prostitutes bathed,)<br>
(and dogs came and licked his blood, and the prostitutes bathed at the place where the prostitutes bathed,)<br>
(and dogs came and licked his blood, and they washed his armour at the place where the prostitutes bathed,)<br>
and dogs came and licked his blood at the place where the prostitutes bathed, just as the Lord had promised.<br>
<br>
Verse 38 here is referring to what the Lord said in the previous chapter, 1 Kings 21,<br>
That's the story of Naboth's Vineyard.  He wanted Naboth's Vineyard, Naboth would not let him buy it or have it,<br>
so he killed Naboth and took it from him anyway...<br>
1 Kings 21:19 (NLT)<br>
Give him this message: 'This is what the Lord says: Wasn't it enough that you killed Naboth? Must you rob him, too? Because you have done this, dogs will lick your blood at the very place where they licked the blood of Naboth!'"<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, let's continue with 1 Kings, chapter 22, continuing at verse 39, stopping when we get to verse 48...<br>
39 The rest of the events in Ahab's reign and everything he did, including the story of the ivory palace and the towns he built, are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.<br>
40 So Ahab died, and his son Ahaziah became the next king.<br>
41 Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to rule over Judah in the fourth year of King Ahab's reign in Israel. <br>
42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.<br>
<br>
By the way, right here in this next verse 43, all the way to the end of this chapter 22, the original verse numbering in the Hebrew text was off by one.<br>
Part of verse 43 was broken off and made into verse 44, making it off by one verse number in the Hebrew text, to the end of this chapter, which is the end of this first book of Kings.<br>
Be that as it may, here's verse 43 in the NLT...<br>
<br>
43 Jehoshaphat was a good king, following the example of his father, Asa. He did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight. During his reign, however, he failed to remove all the pagan shrines, and the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there.<br>
<br>
<br>
44 Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.<br>
45 The rest of the events in Jehoshaphat's reign, the extent of his power, and the wars he waged are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.<br>
46 He banished from the land the rest of the male and female shrine prostitutes, who still continued their practices from the days of his father, Asa.<br>
47 (There was no king in Edom at that time, only a deputy.)<br>
<br>
<br>
48 Jehoshaphat also built (a fleet of ships of Tarshish,) a fleet of trading ships to sail to Ophir for gold. But the ships never set sail, for they met with disaster in their home port of Ezion-geber.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
There are at least two people named Zedekiah in the Bible. One was the final king of Judah and the other one mentioned here was a false prophet.<br>
Apparently, false prophet Zedekiah will hide in a secret, inner chamber within a chamber when he finally discovers and realises that Micaiah's prophecy is true.<br>
The fate of this false prophet Zedekiah, and how he died, is not recorded in the Bible.<br>
The other one, King Zedekiah, was originally called Mattanyahu or Mattaniah, until King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon changed his name.<br>
This other one, this other Zedekiah -- the last and final king of Judah, he was the one who was forced to watch as his sons were killed before his eyes, then his eyes were gouged out, making him blind, and then he was taken to Babylon.<br>
This fulfilled the two prophecies, one saying he would go to Babylon, and the other prophecy saying that he would not see Babylon, both coming true at the same time.<br>
There's only one way to go to some place and not see it at the same time. Go there being blind!<br>
<br>
<br>
We will take a more in-depth look at Micah 2 later on, and what it says about False Prophets.<br>
Again, here is a little sample for now...<br>
Micah 2:10 (KJV)<br>
Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's an important sample from the story we will look at next.<br>
2 Chronicles 20:15 (KJV)<br>
And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 20:15 (NLT)<br>
He said, "Listen, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Listen, King Jehoshaphat! This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid! Don't be discouraged by this mighty army, for the battle is not yours, but God's.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 20 is an amazing story that also tells us some more about that fleet of trading ships that never set sail.<br>
Jumping Jehoshaphat jumped again into something that he should have not jumped into without praying about it first.<br>
Look before your leap, and pray before you jump into something.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 20 is a really cool story, but it's kind of long, so we will only read it here in the NLT.<br>
2 Chronicles 20, all of chapter 20, but only in the NLT, all 37 verses of chapter 20.<br>
<br>
1 After this, the armies of the Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites declared war on Jehoshaphat.<br>
<br>
2 Messengers came and told Jehoshaphat, "(A vast army from Aram,) A vast army from Edom is marching against you (from beyond the sea) from beyond the Dead Sea. They are already at Hazazon-tamar." (This was another name for En-gedi.)<br>
<br>
<br>
3 Jehoshaphat was terrified by this news and begged the Lord for guidance. He also ordered everyone in Judah to begin fasting.<br>
4 So people from all the towns of Judah came to Jerusalem to seek the Lord's help.<br>
5 Jehoshaphat stood before the community of Judah and Jerusalem in front of the new courtyard at the Temple of the Lord.<br>
6 He prayed, "O Lord, God of our ancestors, you alone are the God who is in heaven. You are ruler of all the kingdoms of the earth. You are powerful and mighty; no one can stand against you!<br>
7 O our God, did you not drive out those who lived in this land when your people Israel arrived? And did you not give this land forever to the descendants of your friend Abraham?<br>
<br>
<br>
8 Your people settled here and built this Temple to honour your name.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 They said,<br>
(When evil cometh upon us, such as sword)<br>
(Whenever we are faced with any calamity such as judgement)<br>
(Whenever we are faced with any calamity such as sword of judgement)<br>
'Whenever we are faced with any calamity such as war, plague, or famine, we can come to stand in your presence before this Temple where your name is honoured. We can cry out to you to save us, and you will hear us and rescue us.'<br>
<br>
<br>
10 "And now see what the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir are doing. You would not let our ancestors invade those nations when Israel left Egypt, so they went around them and did not destroy them.<br>
11 Now see how they reward us! For they have come to throw us out of your land, which you gave us as an inheritance.<br>
12 O our God, won't you stop them? We are powerless against this mighty army that is about to attack us. We do not know what to do, but we are looking to you for help."<br>
13 As all the men of Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones, wives, and children,<br>
14 the Spirit of the Lord came upon one of the men standing there. His name was Jahaziel son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite who was a descendant of Asaph.<br>
15 He said, "Listen, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Listen, King Jehoshaphat! This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid! Don't be discouraged by this mighty army, for the battle is not yours, but God's.<br>
16 Tomorrow, march out against them. You will find them coming up through the ascent of Ziz at the end of the valley that opens into the wilderness of Jeruel.<br>
17 But you will not even need to fight. Take your positions; then stand still and watch the Lord's victory. He is with you, O people of Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid or discouraged. Go out against them tomorrow, for the Lord is with you!"<br>
18 Then King Jehoshaphat bowed low with his face to the ground. And all the people of Judah and Jerusalem did the same, worshipping the Lord.<br>
19 Then the Levites from the clans of Kohath and Korah stood to praise the Lord, the God of Israel, with a very loud shout.<br>
20 Early the next morning the army of Judah went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. On the way Jehoshaphat stopped and said, "Listen to me, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be able to stand firm. Believe in his prophets, and you will succeed."<br>
21<br>
After consulting the people, the king appointed singers to walk ahead of the army, singing to the Lord and praising him for his holy splendour. This is what they sang:<br>
"Give thanks to the Lord;<br>
his faithful love endures forever!"<br>
22 At the very moment they began to sing and give praise, the Lord caused the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir to start fighting among themselves.<br>
23 The armies of Moab and Ammon turned against their allies from Mount Seir and killed every one of them. After they had destroyed the army of Seir, they began attacking each other.<br>
24 So when the army of Judah arrived at the lookout point in the wilderness, all they saw were dead bodies lying on the ground as far as they could see. Not a single one of the enemy had escaped.<br>
<br>
<br>
25 King Jehoshaphat and his men went out to gather the plunder.<br>
(They found vast amounts of corpses,)<br>
They found vast amounts of equipment, clothing, and other valuables -- more than they could carry. There was so much plunder that it took them three days just to collect it all!<br>
<br>
(On the fourth day they gathered in the valley of Beracah,)<br>
26 On the fourth day they gathered in the Valley of Blessing, which got its name that day because the people praised and thanked the Lord there. It is still called the Valley of Blessing today.<br>
<br>
<br>
27 Then all the men returned to Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat leading them, overjoyed that the Lord had given them victory over their enemies.<br>
28 They marched into Jerusalem to the music of harps, lyres, and trumpets, and they proceeded to the Temple of the Lord.<br>
29 When all the surrounding kingdoms heard that the Lord himself had fought against the enemies of Israel, the fear of God came over them.<br>
30 So Jehoshaphat's kingdom was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side.<br>
31 So Jehoshaphat ruled over the land of Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.<br>
32 Jehoshaphat was a good king, following the ways of his father, Asa. He did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight.<br>
33 During his reign, however, he failed to remove all the pagan shrines, and the people never fully committed themselves to follow the God of their ancestors.<br>
34 The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in The Record of Jehu Son of Hanani, which is included in The Book of the Kings of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
35 Some time later King Jehoshaphat of Judah made an alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, who was very wicked (and who made him do what was wicked).<br>
<br>
<br>
36 Together they built a fleet of trading ships at the port of Ezion-geber (a fleet of ships that could go to Tarshish).<br>
<br>
<br>
37 Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat. He said, "Because you have allied yourself with King Ahaziah, the Lord will destroy your work." So the ships met with disaster and never put out to sea.<br>
(The ships never set sail for Tarshish.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Jehoshaphat is an example of 2 Corinthians 6:14 -- let's read that verse one more time...<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 6:14 (KJV)<br>
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 6:14 (NLT)<br>
Don't team up with those who are unbelievers. How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Jumping Jehoshaphat!<br>
We have heard that expression before.<br>
It's heard in the 1866 novel, The Headless Horseman, by Thomas Mayne Reid.<br>
It was heard in the NBC TV series, Car 54, Where Are You?, from 1961 to 1963.<br>
Batman's sidekick, Robin, played by Burt Ward, said that on occasion in the ABC TV series, Batman, from 1966 to 1968.<br>
And, you can hear him say it on a recording in the 1974 talking Batman & Robin alarm clock made by Janex.<br>
There is no clear mention in the Bible of Jehoshaphat jumping.<br>
You could imagine, perhaps, that, when they were singing and praising and worshipping, maybe he danced with a jumping motion?<br>
The Bible does not say that.<br>
It's possible to think that, he sometimes appeared to have aligned or associated himself with the wrong side, that is, joining himself to those that were evil and against the Lord, jumping back and forth, going from good to evil and back to good again?<br>
Maybe he jumped from the right side to the wrong side, like someone who follows the Lord tries to work with someone evil that is against the Lord.<br>
It's like he was Jumping, from being with the Lord, into relationships that involve those in opposition to the Lord.<br>
It is frequently seen after the major success, major victory, and happy story ending, when heroes of the Bible make stupid, sinful mistakes.<br>
Can we learn from their mistakes?<br>
For example, king Jehoshaphat was good, but after his major victory and happy story ending, he jumped into an evil relationship, trying to build a fleet of trading ships with King Ahaziah of Israel, who was very wicked, there, towards the end of 2 Chronicles 20.<br>
That bad business deal ended up being a big waste of time and money. Did he pray to the Lord about it first?<br>
The Bible does not mention anything about him seeking the Lord before he made his business move.<br>
Lot did not pray before he decided to move to Sodom and Gomorrah. Big goof!<br>
Are you going to pray and ask for the Lord's advice before you make your big move or financial decision?<br>
Be careful before you make it, and pray about it, and keep on being careful after you make it and reach your moment of success.<br>
After David became king, he committed the sin of adultery and murder.<br>
After Noah was all done with the Flood and the Ark, that's when he got naked and passed-out drunk.<br>
As we have seen before, and are remembering here once again, after heroes of the Bible have their famous moment and enter into success, then they sin and make mistakes.<br>
Just because you reach your milestone achievement of success and accomplishment, do not let your guard down because, when you think all is easy and well, that is when you might sin too.<br>
Once you make it to the top, you have to keep working hard to stay there, on top.<br>
Once you're at the top, it's really easy to fall down, to fall back down the mountain that you just climbed up.<br>
When the going gets tough, the tough get going,<br>
but when the going gets easy, watch out, because you may be going downhill.<br>
It's always easier to go downhill than up a hill, or mountain.<br>
It's easy to stumble into sin when you don't care about being careful, because you made it and you have reached your accomplishment of success.<br>
<br>
Let's go now to our final spot of scripture in the book of Micah.<br>
Like I've said before, you should not always start and stop reading where the chapter numbers start and stop, because the chapter numbers were not originally in the Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Since we were looking the typical heart and mind of a false prophet, let's look at one last bit of scripture on this topic.<br>
Verse 2 here sure reminds me of the story of Naboth's Vineyard!<br>
<br>
Micah 2:1, and we read all of chapter 2 in the KJV,<br>
all 13 verses, and we keep reading into chapter 3,<br>
reading up to Micah 3:7 KJV<br>
<br>
1 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.<br>
<br>
2<br>
And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away:<br>
(so they defraud a man and his house,)<br>
so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.<br>
<br>
3 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
4<br>
In that day shall one take up a parable against you,<br>
(and lament with a lamentation of lamentations,)<br>
and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say,<br>
We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me!<br>
(instead of restoring, he hath divided our fields.)<br>
turning away he hath divided our fields.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the Lord.<br>
<br>
(Drop not, say they to them that prophesy)<br>
(Prophesy not as they prophesy, say they to them that prophesy)<br>
6 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.<br>
<br>
<br>
7<br>
O thou that art named the house of Jacob,<br>
(is the spirit of the Lord shortened?)<br>
is the spirit of the Lord straitened?<br>
are these his doings?<br>
(do not my words do good to him that walketh upright?)<br>
do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?<br>
<br>
<br>
8<br>
(Even yesterday my people is risen up as an enemy:)<br>
Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy:<br>
(ye pull off the robe over against a garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.)<br>
ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.<br>
<br>
9 (The wives of my people,) The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.<br>
<br>
10 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.<br>
<br>
(If a man walk with the wind, and lie falsely,)<br>
11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.<br>
<br>
12 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.<br>
13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord on the head of them.<br>
1 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgement?<br>
2 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;<br>
3 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron.<br>
4 Then shall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.<br>
5 Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Therefore night shall be unto you, from a vision ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, from divining ye shall not divine;)<br>
6<br>
Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine;<br>
and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.<br>
<br>
7<br>
Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:<br>
(yea, they shall all cover their upper lip;)<br>
yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look at this again in the NLT.<br>
<br>
Micah 2:1, and we read all of chapter 2, NLT,<br>
all 13 verses, and we keep reading into chapter 3,<br>
reading up to Micah 3:7 NLT<br>
<br>
1<br>
What sorrow awaits you who lie awake at night,<br>
thinking up evil plans.<br>
You rise at dawn and hurry to carry them out,<br>
simply because you have the power to do so.<br>
2<br>
When you want a piece of land,<br>
you find a way to seize it.<br>
When you want someone's house,<br>
you take it by fraud and violence.<br>
You cheat a man of his property,<br>
stealing his family's inheritance.<br>
3<br>
But this is what the Lord says:<br>
"I will reward your evil with evil;<br>
you won't be able to pull your neck out of the noose.<br>
You will no longer walk around proudly,<br>
for it will be a terrible time."<br>
<br>
<br>
4<br>
In that day your enemies will make fun of you<br>
by singing this song of despair about you:<br>
"We are finished,<br>
completely ruined!<br>
God has confiscated our land,<br>
taking it from us.<br>
He has given our fields<br>
to those who betrayed us."<br>
(He has given our fields to those who took us captive.")<br>
<br>
<br>
5<br>
Others will set your boundaries then,<br>
and the Lord's people will have no say<br>
in how the land is divided.<br>
<br>
<br>
("Don't say such things," they prophesy.)<br>
("Don't say such things," the prophets respond.)<br>
6<br>
"Don't say such things,"<br>
the people respond.<br>
"Don't prophesy like that.<br>
Such disasters will never come our way!"<br>
<br>
<br>
(Should you talk that way, O house of Jacob?)<br>
7<br>
Should you talk that way, O family of Israel?<br>
Will the Lord's Spirit have patience with such behaviour?<br>
If you would do what is right,<br>
you would find my words comforting.<br>
8<br>
Yet to this very hour<br>
my people rise against me like an enemy!<br>
You steal the shirts right off the backs<br>
of those who trusted you,<br>
making them as ragged as men<br>
returning from battle.<br>
9<br>
You have evicted women from their pleasant homes<br>
and forever stripped their children of all that God would give them.<br>
10<br>
Up! Begone!<br>
This is no longer your land and home,<br>
for you have filled it with sin<br>
and ruined it completely.<br>
11<br>
Suppose a prophet full of lies would say to you,<br>
"I'll preach to you the joys of wine and alcohol!"<br>
That's just the kind of prophet you would like!<br>
12<br>
"Someday, O Israel, I will gather you;<br>
I will gather the remnant who are left.<br>
I will bring you together again like sheep in a pen,<br>
like a flock in its pasture.<br>
Yes, your land will again<br>
be filled with noisy crowds!<br>
13<br>
Your leader will break out<br>
and lead you out of exile,<br>
out through the gates of the enemy cities,<br>
back to your own land.<br>
Your king will lead you;<br>
the Lord himself will guide you."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: We are about to read Micah, chapter 3, verse 1, here next.  When you read it, think about how, vaccines contain aborted foetal tissue. We saw the news article that documents this fact when we did the Bible study, titled, Blood, back in Christian Essays 10.<br>
So, when someone takes a jab of a vaccine, they are sending dead babies, dead human flesh into their body, which is cannibalism. Think about that as you now read from Micah, chapter 3, verse 1 through 7, NLT...<br>
By the way, this could also apply to satanic rituals.<br>
<br>
Micah, chapter 3, verse 1 through 7, NLT...<br>
1<br>
I said, "Listen, you leaders of Israel!<br>
You are supposed to know right from wrong,<br>
2<br>
but you are the very ones<br>
who hate good and love evil.<br>
You skin my people alive<br>
and tear the flesh from their bones.<br>
3<br>
Yes, you eat my people's flesh,<br>
strip off their skin,<br>
and break their bones.<br>
You chop them up<br>
like meat for the cooking pot.<br>
4<br>
Then you beg the Lord for help in times of trouble!<br>
Do you really expect him to answer?<br>
After all the evil you have done,<br>
he won't even look at you!"<br>
5<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"You false prophets are leading my people astray!<br>
You promise peace for those who give you food,<br>
but you declare war on those who refuse to feed you.<br>
6<br>
Now the night will close around you,<br>
cutting off all your visions.<br>
Darkness will cover you,<br>
putting an end to your predictions.<br>
The sun will set for you prophets,<br>
and your day will come to an end.<br>
7<br>
Then you seers will be put to shame,<br>
and you fortune-tellers will be disgraced.<br>
And you will cover your faces<br>
because there is no answer from God."<br>
<br>
<br>
And now, as we bring this Bible study to a conclusion, let's think about these last few Bible verses here, next.<br>
Since the false prophet loved to make lies and walk in lies and fiction, may we love to only walk in truth.<br>
Help us, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, obey you and love the truth and walk in truth, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main, Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
3 John 1:4 (KJV)<br>
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.<br>
<br>
Psalms 86:11 (KJV)<br>
Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.<br>
<br>
Psalms 86:11 (NLT)<br>
Teach me your ways, O Lord, that I may live according to your truth! Grant me purity of heart, so that I may honour you.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 18:37 (KJV)<br>
...I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.<br>
<br>
John 18:37 (NLT)<br>
...I am a king. Actually, I was born and came into the world to testify to the truth. All who love the truth recognise that what I say is true."<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1:22 (KJV)<br>
Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:<br>
<br>
1 Peter 1:22 (NLT)<br>
You were cleansed from your sins when you obeyed the truth, so now you must show sincere love to each other as brothers and sisters. Love each other deeply with all your heart.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 3:18 (NLT)<br>
Dear children, let's not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions.<br>
<br>
1 John 3:18 (KJV)<br>
My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 John 1:3 (NLT)<br>
Grace, mercy, and peace, which come from God the Father and from Jesus Christ -- the Son of the Father -- will continue to be with us who live in truth and love.<br>
<br>
2 John 1:3 (KJV)<br>
Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.<br>

<br>
Home Protection<br>
<br>
<br>
In this Bible study, we will extract some parts and pieces of content from some various Bible verses, and assemble them into a prayer,<br>
and use this prayer as a way to cast out evil, unclean spirits out of our home, and then install a hedge of protection around our home to<br>
keep evil, unclean spirits out of our home, even if the home is just a temporary dwelling place.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Job 1:10 (KJV)<br>
...thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side....<br>
<br>
<br>
Job 1:10 (NLT)<br>
You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his property. You have made him prosper in everything he does....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34:7 (KJV)<br>
The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 34: 6-9 NLT<br>
6<br>
In my desperation I prayed, and the Lord listened;<br>
he saved me from all my troubles.<br>
7<br>
For the angel of the Lord is a guard;<br>
he surrounds and defends all who fear him.<br>
8<br>
Taste and see that the Lord is good.<br>
Oh, the joys of those who take refuge in him!<br>
9<br>
Fear the Lord, you his godly people,<br>
for those who fear him will have all they need.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 10:27 KJV<br>
(And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall remove away from off thy shoulder,)<br>
27 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is just one small part of the many things that they did after they had The Tabernacle Completed.<br>
<br>
Exodus 40: 9 & 10 KJV<br>
9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.<br>
10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.<br>
(and it shall be an altar holiness of holinesses.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 40: 9 & 10 NLT<br>
9 "Take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle and all its furnishings to consecrate them and make them holy.<br>
10 Anoint the altar of burnt offering and its utensils to consecrate them. Then the altar will become absolutely holy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 29: 15 & 16 KJV<br>
15 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king,<br>
(in the business of the Lord, to cleanse the house of the Lord.)<br>
by the words of the Lord, to cleanse the house of the Lord.<br>
16 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 29: 3-12 NLT<br>
3 In the very first month of the first year of his reign, Hezekiah reopened the doors of the Temple of the Lord and repaired them.<br>
4 He summoned the priests and Levites to meet him at the courtyard east of the Temple.<br>
5 He said to them, "Listen to me, you Levites! Purify yourselves, and purify the Temple of the Lord, the God of your ancestors. Remove all the defiled things from the sanctuary.<br>
6 Our ancestors were unfaithful and did what was evil in the sight of the Lord our God. They abandoned the Lord and his dwelling place; they turned their backs on him.<br>
7 They also shut the doors to the Temple's entry room, and they snuffed out the lamps. They stopped burning incense and presenting burnt offerings at the sanctuary of the God of Israel.<br>
8 "That is why the Lord's anger has fallen upon Judah and Jerusalem. He has made them an object of dread, horror, and ridicule, as you can see with your own eyes.<br>
9 Because of this, our fathers have been killed in battle, and our sons and daughters and wives have been captured.<br>
10 But now I will make a covenant with the Lord, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger will turn away from us.<br>
11 My sons, do not neglect your duties any longer! The Lord has chosen you to stand in his presence, to minister to him, and to lead the people in worship and present offerings to him."<br>
12 Then these Levites got right to work....<br>
(the names of the clans and families are listed there in verses 12 through 14.)<br>
Let's continue in verse 15...<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 29: 15 & 16 NLT<br>
15 These men called together their fellow Levites, and they all purified themselves. Then they began to cleanse the Temple of the Lord, just as the king had commanded. They were careful to follow all the Lord's instructions in their work.<br>
16 The priests went into the sanctuary of the Temple of the Lord to cleanse it, and they took out to the Temple courtyard all the defiled things they found. From there the Levites carted it all out to the Kidron Valley.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 7:25-26 KJV<br>
25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.<br>
26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 7:25-26 NLT<br>
25 "You must burn their idols in fire, and you must not covet the silver or gold that covers them. You must not take it or it will become a trap to you, for it is detestable to the Lord your God.<br>
26 Do not bring any detestable objects into your home, for then you will be destroyed, just like them. You must utterly detest such things, for they are set apart for destruction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 3:3 KJV<br>
But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 3: 2 & 3 NLT<br>
...we will be rescued from wicked and evil people, for not everyone is a believer.<br>
3 But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.<br>
(he will strengthen you and guard you from evil.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.<br>
<br>
<br>

9 Don't just pretend to love others. Really love them. Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 12: 20 & 21 KJV<br>
20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.<br>
21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 12: 20 & 21 NLT<br>
"If your enemies are hungry, feed them.<br>
If they are thirsty, give them something to drink.<br>
In doing this, you will heap<br>
burning coals of shame on their heads."<br>
21 Don't let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 12:20 is a quote from Proverbs 25:21-22.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 25:21-22 KJV<br>
21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:<br>
22 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee.<br>
<br>
<br>

(And keep us from being tested)<br>
don't let us yield to temptation,<br>
but rescue us from the evil one<br>

<br>
Ephesians 6: 10-13 KJV<br>
10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.<br>
11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.<br>
12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>
13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6: 10-14 NLT<br>
...Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.<br>
11 Put on all of God's armour so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil.<br>
(you are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies,)<br>
12 For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places.<br>
13 Therefore, put on every piece of God's armour so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm.<br>
14 Stand your ground....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 11:22-26 KJV<br>
22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.<br>
23 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.<br>
24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.<br>
25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.<br>
26 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 11:22-26 NLT<br>
22 Then Jesus said to the disciples, "Have faith in God.<br>
23 I tell you the truth, you can say to this mountain, 'May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and it will happen. But you must really believe it will happen and have no doubt in your heart.<br>
24 I tell you, you can pray for anything, and if you believe that you've received it, it will be yours.<br>
25 But when you are praying, first forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins, too."<br>
26 But if you refuse to forgive, your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 17:18-21 KJV<br>
18 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.<br>
19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?<br>
20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.<br>
21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 17:18-21 NLT<br>
18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon in the boy, and it left him. From that moment the boy was well.<br>
19 Afterwards the disciples asked Jesus privately, "Why couldn't we cast out that demon?"<br>
20 "You don't have enough faith," Jesus told them. "I tell you the truth, if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move. Nothing would be impossible."<br>
21 But this kind of demon won't leave except by prayer and fasting.<br>
<br>

4 Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord:<br>
5 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.<br>
6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:<br>
<br>
(And thou shalt whet them diligently unto thy children,)<br>
(And thou shalt sharpen them diligently unto thy children,)<br>
7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.<br>

Deuteronomy 6: 2-15 (NLT)<br>
If you obey all his decrees and commands, you will enjoy a long life.<br>
3 Listen closely, Israel, and be careful to obey. Then all will go well with you, and you will have many children in the land flowing with milk and honey, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, promised you.<br>
<br>
(The Lord our God is one Lord.)<br>
(The Lord our God, the Lord is one.)<br>
(The Lord is our God, the Lord is one.)<br>
<br>
4 "Listen, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord alone.<br>
5 And you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength.<br>
6 And you must commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these commands that I am giving you today.<br>
7 Repeat them again and again to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting up.<br>
8 Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders.<br>
9 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.<br>
10 "The Lord your God will soon bring you into the land he swore to give you when he made a vow to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is a land with large, prosperous cities that you did not build.<br>
11 The houses will be richly stocked with goods you did not produce. You will draw water from cisterns you did not dig, and you will eat from vineyards and olive trees you did not plant. When you have eaten your fill in this land,<br>
12 be careful not to forget the Lord, who rescued you from slavery in the land of Egypt.<br>
13 You must fear the Lord your God and serve him. When you take an oath, you must use only his name.<br>
14 "You must not worship any of the gods of neighbouring nations,<br>
15 for the Lord your God, who lives among you, is a jealous God....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 11:13-28 (KJV)<br>
13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,<br>
14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.<br>
<br>
(And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle,)<br>
15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.<br>
16 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;<br>
17 And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you.<br>
18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.<br>
19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.<br>
20 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:<br>
21 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.<br>
22 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;<br>
23 Then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.<br>
24 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.<br>
25 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.<br>
26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;<br>
27 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day:<br>
28 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 11:13-28 (NLT)<br>
13 "If you carefully obey the commands I am giving you today, and if you love the Lord your God and serve him with all your heart and soul,<br>
14 then he will send the rains in their proper seasons -- the early and late rains -- so you can bring in your harvests of grain, new wine, and olive oil.<br>
15 He will give you lush pastureland for your livestock, and you yourselves will have all you want to eat.<br>
16 "But be careful. Don't let your heart be deceived so that you turn away from the Lord and serve and worship other gods.<br>
17 If you do, the Lord's anger will burn against you. He will shut up the sky and hold back the rain, and the ground will fail to produce its harvests. Then you will quickly die in that good land the Lord is giving you.<br>
18 "So commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these words of mine. Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders.<br>
19 Teach them to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting up.<br>
20 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,<br>
21 so that as long as the sky remains above the earth, you and your children may flourish in the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors.<br>
22 "Be careful to obey all these commands I am giving you. Show love to the Lord your God by walking in his ways and holding tightly to him.<br>
23 Then the Lord will drive out all the nations ahead of you, though they are much greater and stronger than you, and you will take over their land.<br>
24 Wherever you set foot, that land will be yours. Your frontiers will stretch from the wilderness in the south to Lebanon in the north, and from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west (the western sea).<br>
25 No one will be able to stand against you, for the Lord your God will cause the people to fear and dread you, as he promised, wherever you go in the whole land.<br>
26 "Look, today I am giving you the choice between a blessing and a curse!<br>
27 You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today.<br>
28 But you will be cursed if you reject the commands of the Lord your God and turn away from him and worship gods you have not known before.<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Self-forgiveness<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Self-forgiveness is the concept of you forgiving yourself.<br>
The Bible does not really go into this perspective.  It talks about God forgiving you first through Jesus Christ,<br>
and that you are to forgive others.<br>
If you consider the idea that the "others" could be or could include your own self, then here is a collection of verses that can help you forgive yourself, if you think about the "one another" and the "others" including your own self.<br>
Just remember that the first priority is for you to be saved and forgiven by God, and then the second priority is that we need to forgive others so that we will also be forgiven.  We have talked about these first two priorities many times before.  You should pray about these first two priorities first, and then, if you need to pray about you forgiving yourself, these Bible verses can help with that.<br>
May the forgiveness that we are studying about here bring healing to our own selves as well as healing into others.<br>

John 5:24 KJV<br>
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 5:24 NLT<br>
24 "I tell you the truth, those who listen to my message and believe in God who sent me have eternal life. They will never be condemned for their sins, but they have already passed from death into life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 1 & 2 KJV<br>
1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<br>
2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 1 & 2  NLT<br>
1 So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.<br>
2 And because you belong to him, (the law and) the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you (and me) from the power of sin that leads to death.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:29-32 KJV<br>
29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.<br>
30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.<br>
31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:<br>
32 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:29-32  NLT<br>
29 Don't use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.<br>
30 And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own, (and has put his seal on you,) guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.<br>
31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behaviour.<br>
32 Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 5:20 KJV<br>
20 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
James 5: 19 & 20 NLT<br>
...if someone among you wanders away from the truth and is brought back,<br>
20 you can be sure that whoever brings the sinner back from wandering will save that person from death and bring about the forgiveness of many sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 2:4-8 KJV<br>
4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.<br>
5 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.<br>
6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.<br>
7 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.<br>
8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 2:4-8 NLT<br>
4 I wrote that letter in great anguish, with a troubled heart and many tears. I didn't want to grieve you, but I wanted to let you know how much love I have for you.<br>
5 I am not overstating it when I say that the man who caused all the trouble hurt all of you more than he hurt me.<br>
6 Most of you opposed him, and that was punishment enough.<br>
7 Now, however, it is time to forgive and comfort him. Otherwise he may be overcome by discouragement.<br>
8 So I urge you now to reaffirm your love for him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 3: 8 & 9 KJV<br>
8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.<br>
9 Lie not one to another....<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 3: 5-10 NLT<br>
5 So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires. Don't be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater, worshipping the things of this world.<br>
6 Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming.<br>
(Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming on all who disobey him.)<br>
7 You used to do these things when your life was still part of this world.<br>
8 But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behaviour, slander, and dirty language.<br>
9 Don't lie to each other, for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its wicked deeds.<br>
10 Put on your new nature, and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 3:12-16 KJV<br>
12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;<br>
13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.<br>
14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.<br>
15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.<br>
16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom....<br>
<br>
Colossians 3:12-16 NLT<br>
12 Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.<br>
13 Make allowance for each other's faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.<br>
14 Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony.<br>
15 And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body you are called to live in peace. And always be thankful.<br>
16 Let the message about Christ, in all its richness, fill your lives. Teach and counsel each other with all the wisdom he gives....<br>

1 John 1:7-9 KJV<br>
...the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<br>
8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.<br>
9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 1:5-9 NLT<br>
...God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.<br>
6 So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness; we are not practising the truth.<br>
7 But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.<br>
8 If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth.<br>
9 But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5:5-8 KJV<br>
...God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.<br>
6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:<br>
7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.<br>
8 Be sober, be vigilant....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 5:5-9 NLT<br>
...all of you, dress yourselves in humility as you relate to one another, for<br>
"God opposes the proud<br>
but gives grace to the humble."<br>
(Quoting from the Greek version of Proverbs 3:34.)<br>
<br>
6 So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honour.<br>
7 Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.<br>
8 Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.<br>
9 Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.<br>

18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.<br>
<br>
Psalms 25:15-18 NLT<br>
15<br>
My eyes are always on the Lord,<br>
for he rescues me from the traps of my enemies.<br>
16<br>
Turn to me and have mercy,<br>
for I am alone and in deep distress.<br>

My problems go from bad to worse.<br>
Oh, save me from them all!<br>
18<br>
Feel my pain and see my trouble.<br>
Forgive all my sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel 9: 18 & 19 KJV<br>
(...we do not cause to fall our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.)<br>
...we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.<br>
19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God....<br>
<br>
Daniel 9: 18 & 19 NLT<br>
...We make this plea, not because we deserve help, but because of your mercy.<br>

13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent....<br>
<br>
Psalms 19: 12-14 NLT<br>
12<br>
How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart?<br>
Cleanse me from these hidden faults.<br>
13<br>
Keep your servant from deliberate sins!<br>
Don't let them control me.<br>
Then I will be free of guilt<br>
and innocent of great sin.<br>
14<br>
May the words of my mouth<br>
and the meditation of my heart<br>
be pleasing to you,<br>
O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.<br>
<br>
James 5: 13-16 KJV<br>
13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.<br>
14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:<br>
15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.<br>
16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.<br>
<br>
James 5: 13-16 NLT<br>
13 Are any of you suffering hardships? You should pray. Are any of you happy? You should sing praises.<br>
14 Are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord.<br>
15 Such a prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will make you well. And if you have committed any sins, you will be forgiven.<br>
16 Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results.<br>

2 Timothy 2:23-26 KJV<br>
23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.<br>
24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,<br>
25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;<br>
26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2:23-26 -- The Geneva Bible, GNV (1560)<br>
23 And put away foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they engender strife.<br>
24 But the servant of the Lord must not strive, but must be gentle toward all men, able to teach, suffering the evil,<br>
25 Instructing them with meekness that are contrary minded, proving if God at any time will give them repentance, that they may acknowledge the truth,<br>
26 And come to amendment out of that snare of the devil....<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2:20-26 NLT<br>
20 In a wealthy home, some utensils are made of gold and silver, and some are made of wood and clay. The expensive utensils are used for special occasions, and the cheap ones are for everyday use.<br>
21 If you keep yourself pure, you will be a special utensil for honourable use. Your life will be clean, and you will be ready for the Master to use you for every good work.<br>
22 Run from anything that stimulates youthful lusts. Instead, pursue righteous living, faithfulness, love, and peace. Enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with pure hearts.<br>
23 Again I say, don't get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights.<br>
24 A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people.<br>
25 Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people's hearts, and they will learn the truth.<br>
26 Then they will come to their senses and escape from the devil's trap....<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 5:15-17 KJV<br>
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.<br>
16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.<br>
17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.<br>
<br>
Galatians 5:15-17 NLT<br>
(Leviticus 19:18 says,) "Love your neighbour as yourself."<br>
15 But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out! Beware of destroying one another.<br>
16 So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won't be doing what your sinful nature craves.<br>
17 The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions.<br>
<br>

Psalms 39:7-10 KJV<br>
7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.<br>
8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.<br>
9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.<br>
10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.<br>
(I am consumed by the conflict of thine hand.)<br>
<br>
Psalms 39:7-10 NLT<br>
7<br>
And so, Lord, where do I put my hope?<br>
My only hope is in you.<br>
8<br>
Rescue me from my rebellion.<br>
Do not let fools mock me.<br>
9<br>
I am silent before you; I won't say a word,<br>
for my punishment is from you.<br>
10<br>
But please stop striking me!<br>
I am exhausted by the blows from your hand.<br>

The Lord nurses them when they are sick<br>

Heal me, for I have sinned against you."<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Psalms 6: 1-4 NLT<br>
1<br>
O Lord, don't rebuke me in your anger<br>
or discipline me in your rage.<br>
2<br>
Have compassion on me, Lord, for I am weak.<br>
Heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.<br>
3<br>
I am sick at heart.<br>
How long, O Lord, until you restore me?<br>
4<br>
Return, O Lord, and rescue me.<br>
Save me....<br>

Psalms 30: 2 & 3 KJV<br>

<br>
Psalms 30: 1-3 NLT<br>
1<br>
I will exalt you, Lord, for you rescued me.<br>
You refused to let my enemies triumph over me.<br>
2<br>
O Lord my God, I cried to you for help,<br>
and you restored my health.<br>

Dear Lord Jesus, Dear Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yah-Who-Shaw,<br>
In the name of Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, we cast out an evil spirit of condemnation, and an evil spirit of unforgiveness, and the condemnation and unforgiveness of us upon our own self.<br>
Cast out of me an evil spirit of self-opposition. Help me not be lazy, slothful, distracted or inattentive.<br>
Cast these evil spirits out of and away from my own self, my family, my friends, my neighbours, and cast these evil spirits out of my home.<br>
Keep these evil spirits away from me as I travel and move and transport myself and my family throughout each day.<br>
<br>
Help me, and guard and bless my ability to manage and store and transport myself, my family and our belongings carefully and safely.<br>
Protect me from those who worship an evil spirit of selfishness, an evil spirit of rebellion and from those who get pleasure from worshipping an evil spirit of lawlessness, and protect me from those possessed with an evil spirit of unforgiveness, anger and bitterness.<br>
Help me pray for others, and help me not judge, curse or condemn others. Help me not be angry.  Help me forgive others, and help me forgive myself.<br>
Help me not be the victim of someone else's sin.<br>
<br>
Bless and protect my means of mobility and my means of transportation.<br>
If I have a vehicle or transportation of any kind, bless it, heal it and protect it.<br>
Help us and heal us so that we will forgive our own self.<br>
Help us think and walk carefully through each day.<br>
Help us in our thoughts, movements and actions, and bless our thoughts and actions with careful wisdom and obedience.<br>
Help our heart, mind and soul, and help our thoughts and actions, and help us not to walk, fall into, click into, tap into, dabble in, trip or stumble into any kind of sin.<br>
<br>
We know not what we do, and we don't know what we are doing, so bless and protect what we are doing with your good shepherding, your good guidance and your good wisdom and protection.<br>
We thankfully receive your forgiveness, your mercy and grace. Please bless us, strengthen us, heal us, help us, save us, and protect us and forgive us.<br>
In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Amen, Ah-Main.<br>

At the website, Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, an easy search there provides some basic information about<br>
Bethel Church and Bethel Music.<br>
<br>
Here is a little bit about what Wikipedia said, back in September 2021.<br>
<br>
Bethel Church is an American non-denominational neo-charismatic megachurch in Redding, California<br>
with over 11,000 members.<br>
The church was established in 1952 and is currently (as it was in September 2021) led by Bill Johnson.<br>
Bethel has its own music labels, and Bethel Music, and Jesus Culture ministries, which have gained large popularity within contemporary worship music.<br>
The church runs the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry with over 2,000 students annually.<br>
Senior church leaders have been supporters of conservative politics.<br>
<br>
Bethel Music is an American music label and worship movement from Redding, California,<br>
originating out of Bethel Church where they started making music in 2001.<br>
Bethel Music has grown from being a local church music ministry<br>
to a global outreach made up of a collective of songwriters, artists and musicians.<br>
They focus on producing worship songs and albums.<br>
<br>
Their list of music releases keeps growing.<br>
When the list was checked in September 2021, it indicated at that time,<br>
The count of the number of releases in the Bethel Music discography was...<br>
Studio albums, 2<br>
Live albums, 13<br>
Compilation albums, 1<br>
Music videos, 74<br>
EPs, 1<br>
Singles, 10<br>
Remix albums, 4<br>
Lyric videos, 65.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The album, We Will Not Be Shaken (Live) is the tenth album from California based Bethel Music. The album was released through the group's label, Bethel Music, on 26 January 2015.<br>
One song on that album is, "No Longer Slaves." We will take a look at the lyrics to that song, No Longer Slaves, here in just a moment.<br>
<br>
Commentary: The album was released first, then the first single, No Longer Slaves, was not released until almost seven months later.<br>
This is the opposite of the usual marketing strategy in the music industry.<br>
Usually the single is released just before the album is released.<br>
The single is a single song chosen and released for promotion, individual purchase, downloading, YouTube viewing, and radio play, to help promote the new, soon-to-be-released album, and generate some interest and excitement about a new album just before it gets released,<br>
by releasing a single beforehand, to help stimulate promotion for the band and the new album.<br>
Be that as it may, the album was released first in January 2015, and then the first single was not released until almost seven months later, in August.<br>
<br>
"No Longer Slaves" is a song by Bethel Music featuring Jonathan David & Melissa Helser and it was released as a single on 21 August 2015 as Bethel Music's first, lead single from their seventh live album, We Will Not Be Shaken.<br>
The song also appeared on the album Bethel Music en Espanol (2019).<br>
The song won the "Worship Song of the Year" award at the 47th Annual Gospel Music Association (GMA) Dove Awards in 2016,<br>
with Jonathan David & Melissa Helser performing it live at the ceremony.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some of the lyrics that we will read here, next, are repeated additional times to demonstrate the slight lyrical changes and variations between the different recordings and live performances.<br>
<br>
From their album, We Will Not Be Shaken (Live), here are the words to the 2015 song, No Longer Slaves, by Bethel Music.<br>
<br>
<br>
You unravel me with a melody<br>
You surround me with a song<br>
Of deliverance from my enemies<br>
'Til all my fears are gone<br>
<br>
I'm no longer a slave to fear<br>
I am a child of God<br>
I'm no longer a slave to fear<br>
I am a child of God<br>
<br>
From my mother's womb<br>
You have chosen me<br>
Love has called my name<br>
I've been born again to your family<br>
Your blood flows through my veins<br>
<br>
I'm no longer a slave to fear<br>
I am a child of God<br>
I'm no longer a slave to fear<br>
I am a child of God<br>
<br>
From my mother's womb<br>
You have chosen me<br>
Love has called my name<br>
I've been born again to a family<br>
Your blood flows through my veins<br>
<br>
I'm no longer a slave to fear<br>
I am a child of God<br>
I'm no longer a slave to fear<br>
I am a child of God<br>
<br>
<br>
I am surrounded<br>
By the arms of the Father<br>
I am surrounded<br>
By songs of deliverance<br>
<br>
We've been liberated<br>
From our bondage<br>
We're the sons and the daughters<br>
Let us sing our freedom<br>
<br>
<br>
You split the sea<br>
So I could walk right through it<br>
My fears are drowned in perfect love<br>
You rescued me<br>
So I could stand and say<br>
I am a child of God<br>
<br>
You split the sea<br>
So I could walk right through it<br>
My fears are drowned in perfect love<br>
You rescued me<br>
And I will stand and sing<br>
I am a child of God<br>
<br>
You split the sea<br>
So I could walk right through it<br>
You drown my fears in perfect love<br>
You rescued me<br>
And I will stand and say<br>
I am a child of God<br>
<br>
You split the sea<br>
So I could walk right through it<br>
My fears are drowned in perfect love<br>
You rescued me<br>
So I could stand and say<br>
I am a child of God<br>
I am a child of God<br>
Yes, I am a child of God<br>
<br>
<br>
I am a child of God<br>
Yes, I am<br>
I am a child of God<br>
Yes, I am<br>
I am a child of God<br>
Full of faith<br>
Yes, I am a child of God<br>
I am a child of God<br>
<br>
I'm no longer a slave to fear<br>
I am a child of God<br>
I'm no longer a slave to fear<br>
I am a child of God<br>
