2 Corinthians 4: 6-12 KJV<br>
6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<br>
7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.<br>
8 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;<br>
9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;<br>
10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.<br>
11 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.<br>
12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 4: 6-12 NLT<br>
6 For God, who said, "Let there be light in the darkness," has made this light shine in our hearts so we could know the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ.<br>
(We now have this treasure in clay jars. This makes it clear that our great power is from God, not from ourselves.)<br>
7 We now have this light shining in our hearts, but we ourselves are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure.<br>
<br>
8 We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed. We are perplexed, but not driven to despair.<br>
9 We are hunted down, but never abandoned by God. We get knocked down, but we are not destroyed.<br>
10 Through suffering, our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies.<br>
11 Yes, we live under constant danger of death because we serve Jesus, so that the life of Jesus will be evident in our dying bodies.<br>
12 So we live in the face of death, but this has resulted in eternal life for you.<br>
<br>

Reading from 2 Corinthians 4:16 into 2 Corinthians, chapter 5, verse 1 -- KJV<br>
16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.<br>
17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;<br>
18 Whilst we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.<br>
1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Reading from 2 Corinthians 4:16, 17 and 18, the end of chapter 4, and then we read the first verse of the next chapter, going into 2 Corinthians, chapter 5, verse 1 -- NLT<br>
<br>
(That is why we never give up. Though our bodies are dying, our inner being is being renewed every day.)<br>
16 That is why we never give up. Though our bodies are dying, our spirits are being renewed every day.<br>
<br>
17 For our present troubles are small and won't last very long. Yet they produce for us a glory that vastly outweighs them and will last forever!<br>
18 So we don't look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen. For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever.<br>
1 For we know that when this earthly tent we live in is taken down (that is, when we die and leave this earthly body), we will have a house in heaven, an eternal body made for us by God himself and not by human hands.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 15: 42-49 KJV<br>
42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:<br>
43 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:<br>
44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.<br>
45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.<br>
46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.<br>
47 The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.<br>
48 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.<br>
49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 15: 42-49 NLT<br>
42 It is the same way with the resurrection of the dead. Our earthly bodies are planted in the ground when we die, but they will be raised to live forever.<br>
43 Our bodies are buried in brokenness, but they will be raised in glory. They are buried in weakness, but they will be raised in strength.<br>
44 They are buried as natural human bodies, but they will be raised as spiritual bodies. For just as there are natural bodies, there are also spiritual bodies.<br>
<br>
45 The Scriptures tell us (in the book of Genesis 2:7), "The first man, Adam, became a living person. But the last Adam -- that is, Christ -- is a life-giving Spirit."<br>
<br>
<br>
46 What comes first is the natural body, then the spiritual body comes later.<br>
47 Adam, the first man, was made from the dust of the earth, whilst Christ, the second man, came from heaven.<br>
48 Earthly people are like the earthly man, and heavenly people are like the heavenly man.<br>
<br>
(Just as we are now like the earthly man, let us be like the heavenly man.)<br>
49 Just as we are now like the earthly man, we will someday be like the heavenly man.<br>
<br>

Genesis 22: verses 1 and 2, then we skip down to verses 6 through 14 -- KJV<br>
<br>
1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, (Behold me,) Behold, here I am.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.<br>
6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.<br>
<br>
<br>
7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb (or kid) for a burnt offering?<br>
<br>
<br>
8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.<br>
9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.<br>
10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.<br>
11 And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.<br>
12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.<br>
13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.<br>
<br>
(Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh, that is, The Lord will see, The Lord will provide.)<br>
14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah–jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Genesis 22: verses 1 and 2, then we jump down to verses 6 through 14 -- NLT<br>
1<br>
Some time later, God tested Abraham's faith. "Abraham!" God called.<br>
"Yes," he replied. "Here I am."<br>
2<br>
"Take your son, your only son -- yes, Isaac, whom you love so much -- and go to the land of Moriah. Go and sacrifice him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will show you."<br>
6<br>
So Abraham placed the wood for the burnt offering on Isaac's shoulders, whilst he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them walked on together,<br>
7<br>
Isaac turned to Abraham and said, "Father?"<br>
"Yes, my son?" Abraham replied.<br>
"We have the fire and the wood," the boy said, "but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?"<br>
8<br>
"God will provide a sheep for the burnt offering, my son," Abraham answered. And they both walked on together.<br>
9<br>
When they arrived at the place where God had told him to go, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. Then he tied his son, Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.<br>
10<br>
And Abraham picked up the knife to kill his son as a sacrifice.<br>
11<br>
At that moment the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!"<br>
"Yes," Abraham replied. "Here I am!"<br>
12<br>
"Don't lay a hand on the boy!" the angel said. "Do not hurt him in any way, for now I know that you truly fear God. You have not withheld from me even your son, your only son."<br>
13<br>
Then Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. So he took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering in place of his son.<br>
14<br>
Abraham named the place Yahweh-Yireh (which means "the Lord will provide"). To this day, people still use that name as a proverb: "On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided."<br>

Let us consider the words to this 2018 song, "Isaac."<br>
Isaac is a song, released as a Single, by Hollyn.<br>
The single was released on 19 October 2018.<br>
This song was released only as a single, and is not available on any album, as of November 2019.<br>
<br>
The song is inspired by the story of Abraham sacrificing Isaac in Genesis 22. Hollyn explained, "I reflected upon this story, I realised how much it related to what I was going through. This song is about giving something that God gave you back to Him, even if it hurts."<br>
In December 2018, Hollyn also said:<br>
"While writing this song, I didn't know what to call it. I kept hearing people mention the story of Abraham and Isaac, and how parallel my story was to it. The story is about complete surrender, even when it makes no sense. I resonated with that so much because God was preparing something for me even though I couldn't see it – even though it was painful and I didn't understand."<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2018 song, Isaac, by Hollyn.<br>
<br>
<br>

After looking at a prophesy about the Restoration for Israel, in chapter 36, the book of Ezekiel, Chapter 37, talks about A Valley of Dry Bones and the Reunion of Israel and Judah.<br>
These bones represent the people of Israel, being brought back to life, so that they will live again and return home to their own land.<br>
This also applies to the believers and followers of Christ, that are saved and forgiven, for they are also Israel, grafted into Israel.<br>
It mentions in verse 28, that the Lord is the one who makes Israel holy, the Lord is the one who will sanctify Israel.<br>
Here is a little sample from Ezekiel 37...<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 37: 9 & 10 (KJV)<br>
Then said he unto me, (Prophesy unto the breath,) Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, (and say to the breath,) and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.<br>
10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 37: 9 & 10 (NLT)<br>
9 Then he said to me, "Speak a prophetic message to the winds, son of man. Speak a prophetic message and say, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Come, O breath, from the four winds! Breathe into these dead bodies so they may live again.'"<br>
10 So I spoke the message as he commanded me, and breath came into their bodies. They all came to life and stood up on their feet -- a great army.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 37: 26-28 KJV<br>
26 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.<br>
27 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br>
28 And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 37: 26-28 NLT<br>
(And I will make a covenant of peace with them, an everlasting covenant. I will give them and increase their numbers, and I will put my Temple among them forever.)<br>
26 And I will make a covenant of peace with them, an everlasting covenant. I will give them their land and increase their numbers, and I will put my Temple among them forever.<br>
27 I will make my home among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people. <br>
28 And when my Temple is among them forever, the nations will know that I am the Lord, who makes Israel holy."<br>

<p>
<br>
Pig-Mouse<br>
<br>
<br>
In Isaiah, the last two chapters at the end of the book of Isaiah, chapters 65 and 66, we read the words of the Lord talking about Judgement and Final Salvation.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 66:10-18 (KJV)<br>
10 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:<br>
<br>
11 That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.<br>
(...be delighted with the brightness of her glory.) <br>
<br>
12 For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.<br>
13 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.<br>
14 And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.<br>
15 For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.<br>
16 For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.<br>
<br>
17 They that sanctify themselves, (and purify themselves in the gardens, one after another, in the midst,) and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.<br>
<br>
18 For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 66:10-18 (NLT)<br>
10<br>
"Rejoice with Jerusalem!<br>
Be glad with her, all you who love her<br>
and all you who mourn for her.<br>
11<br>
Drink deeply of her glory<br>
even as an infant drinks at its mother's comforting breasts."<br>
12<br>
This is what the Lord says:<br>
"I will give Jerusalem a river of peace and prosperity.<br>
The wealth of the nations will flow to her.<br>
Her children will be nursed at her breasts,<br>
carried in her arms, and held on her lap.<br>
13<br>
I will comfort you there in Jerusalem<br>
as a mother comforts her child."<br>
14<br>
When you see these things, your heart will rejoice.<br>
You will flourish like the grass!<br>
Everyone will see the Lord's hand of blessing on his servants -- <br>
and his anger against his enemies.<br>
15<br>
See, the Lord is coming with fire,<br>
and his swift chariots roar like a whirlwind.<br>
He will bring punishment with the fury of his anger<br>
and the flaming fire of his hot rebuke.<br>
16<br>
The Lord will punish the world by fire<br>
and by his sword.<br>
He will judge the earth,<br>
and many will be killed by him.<br>
17<br>
"Those who 'consecrate' and 'purify' themselves in a sacred garden with its idol in the centre -- feasting on pork and rats and other detestable meats -- will come to a terrible end," says the Lord.<br>
18<br>
"I can see what they are doing, and I know what they are thinking. So I will gather all nations and peoples together, and they will see my glory.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's focus on this particular verse...<br>
Isaiah 66:17 (KJV)<br>
They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.<br>
<br>

John Wiley & Sons, Inc. publishes the Wiley Online Library.<br>
This online library contains Scientific research articles, journals, books, and reference works.<br>
<br>
One of their articles is titled, <br>
Identification of pig chromosomes in pig-mouse somatic cell hybrid bivariate flow karyotypes<br>
<br>
The webpage is located here...<br>
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.990140405">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.990140405</a><br>
<br>
On that webpage, the abstract says that the purpose of this study was,<br>
"To identify pig chromosomes in pig-mouse somatic cell hybrids, dual-laser flow karyotypes and GTG-banded metaphase spreads of pig, mouse, and 7 pig-mouse hybrid cell lines were compared."<br>
<br>
That study was First published in 1993.<br>
<br>
Now, let's fast-forward from 1993 to 2001.<br>
<br>
The University of Guelph (The U of G), in Ontario, Canada, sent out a news release on 31 July 2001.<br>
<br>
The news release was found in 2019 at the following location...<br>
<a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/mediarel/archives/000404.html">https://www.uoguelph.ca/mediarel/archives/000404.html</a><br>
<br>
That news release has the following headline...<br>
U of G's 'enviropig' a success, new study reveals<br>
<br>
The first paragraph says...<br>
A first-ever study of the University of Guelph's "enviropigs" confirms what researchers predicted all along: the animals produce manure that is more environmentally-friendly, containing up to 75 per cent less phosphorus.<br>
<br>
What is an enviropig?  It's a pig combined with a mouse. It is just another Bible prophecy becoming true right before your very eyes.<br>
<br>
The news release explains it this way...<br>
"Animal waste is a leading source of phosphorus pollution from agriculture. This arises because phytate phosphorous, the major form of phosphorus in cereal grains, is not digested and is instead excreted in faecal materials by pigs and other animals. Phosphorus pollutes surface and groundwater and promotes the growth of algae in rivers, lakes and streams, reducing available oxygen to fish and aquatic life.<br>
<br>
"To correct this problem, the researchers combined an E. coli gene that makes the enzyme phytase and a small portion of a mouse gene that controls the production of a protein secreted in the salivary glands to make a new composite gene. The composite gene was inserted into the nucleus of a one-celled pig embryo with a microscopic needle, and the embryos were then surgically implanted in a foster mother. The gene allows the pig to make phytase in the salivary gland and secrete it into its saliva, where it is swallowed with food. The phytase releases phosphate in the animal's gut that can be absorbed by the bloodstream."<br>
<br>
In the news release, Molecular Biologist, John Phillips, said:<br>
"The fact that phosphorus levels were reduced in the pigs shows that the gene is working."<br>
<br>
Again, that was published on 31 July 2001.<br>
<br>
What became of that?<br>
This is what the public was being told, back on 01 May 2018.<br>
<br>
The New Food Economy is a non-profit news website that investigates the people and institutes that are shaping how and what we eat.<br>
<br>
On 01 May 2018 staff writer, Sam Bloch, published an article with the headline, <br>
<br>
"Hornless Holsteins and Enviropigs: the genetically engineered animals we never knew."<br>
<br>
The article was published here...<br>
<a href="https://newfoodeconomy.org/transgenesis-gene-editing-fda-aquabounty/">https://newfoodeconomy.org/transgenesis-gene-editing-fda-aquabounty/</a><br>
<br>
in that article, it says the following...<br>
Remember the Enviropig? In 1999, the first pig genetically modified for food was created by scientists at the University of Guelph, outside Toronto.<br>
<br>
<br>
Researchers applied to both FDA and Health Canada for permits. But in 2012, Ontario Pork, the association of Canadian hog farmers that had been funding the safety testing, dropped its support. None of their pigs had sold. And a competing feed supplement that did the same thing as the enzyme was getting cheaper. Most importantly, neither the Canadian nor American governments had approved the pig for food.<br>
<br>
One of the scientists told Iowa State Daily (newspaper in 2012), "Food companies have been slow to back genetically engineered animals without a clear approval process."<br>
<br>
Without funding, The New York Times (newspaper) reported (in 2012), the university euthanized the 16 Enviropigs in the herd, and froze the transgenic semen. The project's lead scientist noted that Chinese companies had expressed interest, but no deal was reached.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Chicago Tribune newspaper does not allow computers that are outside the United States to visit their website.<br>
But, that does not stop any smart person from going there anyway.<br>
<br>
The next news article was found at this location...<br>
<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-cb-genetically-modified-salmon-indiana-hatchery-20190509-story.html">https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-cb-genetically-modified-salmon-indiana-hatchery-20190509-story.html</a><br>
<br>
The headline was, "What is an Enviropig, a GloFish and a Friendly Mosquito?"<br>
<br>
This article was reported by Tony Briscoe, at the Chicago Tribune newspaper, on 29 May 2019.<br>
<br>
In that report, it said...<br>
<br>
"In 1999, Canadian scientists at the University of Guelph created the so-called Enviropig, among the first farm animals designed to be environmentally friendly. With a gene from E. coli bacteria and DNA from a mouse, the swine was able to digest phosphorous in its animal feed. That enabled the pig to excrete less pollution in its faeces, a major contributor to harmful algae blooms and "dead zones" in waterways. After the endeavour lost funding in 2012, it was ultimately abandoned and the last of the transgenic pigs was euthanized."<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, this is what the general public is being told, but what is going on secretly?<br>
<br>
This Bible prophecy promises that people will be, "eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together."<br>
<br>
Commentary:  I think it would be safe to assume that satan is trying to trick people into doing satanic things, like sexual immorality, drinking blood and eating pig.<br>
Just look at what is in parades and vaccines.<br>
I think people are being tricked right now into doing those things, worshipping satan without even knowing that they are.<br>
We may be accurate in assuming that those Chinese companies are secretly continuing their work and research in the Enviropig.<br>
When we looked at the article from The New Food Economy, did you notice it indicates that more that one company in China was interested in the Enviropig?<br>
Since the Bible mentions it, and the Bible is true, then we can assume that some people may already be eating the Enviropig, version 2.0 or 3.0, right now without even knowing it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Satan has been trying, slowly and secretly to gently slip us further and further away from the truth, across the recent centuries of time.<br>
Just think about our Heavenly Father's actual, sacred name being removed from our Bibles and replaced with 'Lord.'<br>
Think about having Sabbath switched to Sundays, the spirit of Christmas, Easter Eggs, Ash Wednesday, worshipping saint so-and-so's day, and so on.<br>
<br>
<br>
People will also be eating the abomination?  What is that?  Are people eating that right now, already?<br>
Many people probably are, and they do not even know that they are secretly worshipping satan when they eat it today.<br>
What is the abomination? We do not know, exactly, just yet. If you were to make a list of all of the things that the Lord says is an abomination, chances are, they will be eating one of those things on that list, but we do not really know what the abomination is that they will be eating.<br>
<br>
Whatever it is, it will be put on display in the re-built temple, half way into the tribulation.<br>
<br>
Again, what we read, earlier in The New Food Economy was that, "The project's lead scientist noted that Chinese companies had expressed interest, but no deal was reached."<br>
<br>
Do you think that is really true?<br>

<br>
<br>
On 7 June 2018, The Western Producer published an article by Robert Arnason.<br>
<br>
<br>
This 2018 news headline said, China develops an "Enviro-pig."<br>
<br>
Here are some selected, quoted parts from this article.<br>
<br>
"...in a biochemistry and chemical biology journal, scientists from South China Agricultural University and China Agricultural University, wrote about "novel" transgenic hogs that grow faster and have less impact on the environment.<br>
<br>
"The research seems to build upon work done at the University of Guelph in the late 1990s and 2000s. U of Guelph researchers used foreign genes from mice and bacteria so transgenic pigs could produce enzymes that break down phosphorus and therefore digest more of the nutrient in their feed.<br>
<br>
"Mingzhe Fan was one of the U of Guelph scientists who worked on the original project. He is now collaborating with Chinese researchers on the new and improved transgenic pig.<br>
<br>
"China, which has about half of the pigs in the world, may be tempted to adopt genetic technology so the country is self-sufficient in pork production.<br>
<br>
"Bjorn Petersen, of the Friedrich Loeffler Institut in Germany, said cutting the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in pig manure is an excellent way to reduce water pollution.<br>
<br>
"The pigs developed by Zhang (and the others) might create a win-win situation for both farmers and environment."<br>
<br>
Those were some of the things said in the article published on 7 June 2018, from The Western Producer.<br>
Many of the major news sources in the United States did not mention this.<br>
They still think and report that the project stopped many years ago, and was not continued.<br>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, Bible prophecy is coming true, and will come to pass, even if it happens secretly and behind-the-scenes.<br>
It's no secret in the sight of the Lord. Make the Lord your Good Shepherd, and he will walk you safely through it.<br>

Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 6: 18-20 (NLT)<br>
...we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us.<br>
19 This hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain into God's inner sanctuary.<br>
20 Jesus has already gone in there for us....<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 6: 18-20 NIV<br>
...we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged.<br>
19 We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,<br>
20 where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf....<br>

Commentary:<br>
<br>
"In order to realise the worth of the anchor, we need to feel the stress of the storm."<br>
<br>
That is a quote from Corrie Ten Boom (1892 - 1983).<br>
<br>
Corrie Ten Boom was known for her many famous quotes.<br>
<br>
Corrie Ten Boom was a Dutch Christian watchmaker and author who,<br>
along with her family, helped many Jews escape the Nazis during the Holocaust<br>
by hiding them in their home.<br>
<br>
She was imprisoned for her actions and later wrote about her experiences,<br>
most notably in her book "The Hiding Place."<br>
<br>
We will be reading the NLT of Hebrews 6 again, here in just a moment.<br>

<br>
Jeremiah 31:31-34 -- KJV<br>
31 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:<br>
<br>
<br>
32 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord.<br>
(...which my covenant they brake, should I have continued an husband unto them?)<br>
<br>
33 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br>
34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 31:31-34 -- NLT<br>
31 "The day is coming," says the Lord, "when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah.<br>
32 This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and brought them out of the land of Egypt. They broke that covenant, though I loved them as a husband loves his wife," says the Lord.<br>
33 "But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel after those days," says the Lord. "I will put my instructions deep within them, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.<br>
34 And they will not need to teach their neighbours, nor will they need to teach their relatives, saying, 'You should know the Lord.' For everyone, from the least to the greatest, will know me already," says the Lord. "And I will forgive their wickedness, and I will never again remember their sins."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The book of Hebrews, chapters 4 through 10.<br>
Because we are covering a span of 6 chapters, we will only be reading this in the NLT.<br>
We will start in chapter 4, verse 14, and we will keep on reading, hopefully non-stop, until we get to Hebrews 9, verse 15, NLT.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 4:14-9:15 NLT<br>
<br>
14 So then, since we have a great High Priest who has entered heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we believe.<br>
15 This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet he did not sin.<br>
16 So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.<br>
1 Every high priest is a man chosen to represent other people in their dealings with God. He presents their gifts to God and offers sacrifices for their sins.<br>
2 And he is able to deal gently with ignorant and wayward people because he himself is subject to the same weaknesses.<br>
3 That is why he must offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as theirs.<br>
4 And no one can become a high priest simply because he wants such an honour. He must be called by God for this work, just as Aaron was.<br>
5<br>
That is why Christ did not honour himself by assuming he could become High Priest. No, he was chosen by God, who said to him,<br>
"You are my Son.<br>
Today I have become your Father.<br>
(Today I reveal you as my Son.)<br>
(quoting from Psalms 2:7)<br>
<br>
6<br>
And in another passage God said to him,<br>
"You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."<br>
(from Psalms 110:4)<br>
<br>
<br>
7 While Jesus was here on earth, he offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who could rescue him from death. And God heard his prayers because of his deep reverence for God.<br>
8 Even though Jesus was God's Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.<br>
9 In this way, God qualified him as a perfect High Priest, and he became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him.<br>
10 And God designated him to be a High Priest in the order of Melchizedek.<br>
11 There is much more we would like to say about this, but it is difficult to explain, especially since you are spiritually dull and don't seem to listen.<br>
<br>
<br>
(You have been believers so long now that you ought to be teaching others. Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things about the oracles of God.)<br>
12 You have been believers so long now that you ought to be teaching others. Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things about God's word. You are like babies who need milk and cannot eat solid food.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
13 For someone who lives on milk is still an infant and doesn't know how to do what is right.<br>
14 Solid food is for those who are mature, who through training have the skill to recognise the difference between right and wrong.<br>
<br>
1 So let us stop going over the basic teachings about Christ again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don't need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds and placing our faith in God.<br>
(Surely we don't need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from dead works and placing our faith in God.)<br>
<br>
<br>
2 You don't need further instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgement.<br>
3 And so, God willing, we will move forward to further understanding.<br>
4 For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened -- those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit,<br>
5 who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come --<br>
6 and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance; by rejecting the Son of God, they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame.<br>
7 When the ground soaks up the falling rain and bears a good crop for the farmer, it has God's blessing.<br>
8 But if a field bears thorns and thistles, it is useless. The farmer will soon condemn that field and burn it.<br>
9 Dear friends, even though we are talking this way, we really don't believe it applies to you. We are confident that you are meant for better things, things that come with salvation.<br>
<br>
<br>
10 For God is not unjust. (He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for God's holy people,) He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other believers as you still do.<br>
<br>
11 Our great desire is that you will keep on loving others as long as life lasts, in order to make certain that what you hope for will come true.<br>
12 Then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent. Instead, you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God's promises because of their faith and endurance.<br>
13 For example, there was God's promise to Abraham. Since there was no one greater to swear by, God took an oath in his own name, saying:<br>
<br>
14<br>
"I will certainly bless you,<br>
and I will multiply your descendants beyond number."<br>
(quoting from Genesis 22:17)<br>
<br>
<br>
15 Then Abraham waited patiently, and he received what God had promised.<br>
16 Now when people take an oath, they call on someone greater than themselves to hold them to it. And without any question that oath is binding.<br>
17 God also bound himself with an oath, so that those who received the promise could be perfectly sure that he would never change his mind.<br>
18 So God has given both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us.<br>
19 This hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain into God's inner sanctuary.<br>
20 Jesus has already gone in there for us. He has become our eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek.<br>
1 This Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem and also a priest of God Most High. When Abraham was returning home after winning a great battle against the kings, Melchizedek met him and blessed him.<br>
2 Then Abraham took a tenth of all he had captured in battle and gave it to Melchizedek. The name Melchizedek means "king of justice," and king of Salem means "king of peace."<br>
3 There is no record of his father or mother or any of his ancestors -- no beginning or end to his life. He remains a priest forever, resembling the Son of God.<br>
4 Consider then how great this Melchizedek was. Even Abraham, the great patriarch of Israel, recognised this by giving him a tenth of what he had taken in battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 Now the law of Moses required that the priests, who are descendants of Levi, must collect a tithe (from their brothers,) from the rest of the people of Israel who are also descendants of Abraham.<br>
<br>
<br>
6 But Melchizedek, who was not a descendant of Levi, collected a tenth from Abraham. And Melchizedek placed a blessing upon Abraham, the one who had already received the promises of God.<br>
7 And without question, the person who has the power to give a blessing is greater than the one who is blessed.<br>
8 The priests who collect tithes are men who die, so Melchizedek is greater than they are, because we are told that he lives on.<br>
9 In addition, we might even say that these Levites -- the ones who collect the tithe -- paid a tithe to Melchizedek when their ancestor Abraham paid a tithe to him.<br>
10 For although Levi wasn't born yet, the seed from which he came was in Abraham's body when Melchizedek collected the tithe from him.<br>
11 So if the priesthood of Levi, on which the law was based, could have achieved the perfection God intended, why did God need to establish a different priesthood, with a priest in the order of Melchizedek instead of (the order of Aaron,) the order of Levi and Aaron?<br>
12 And if the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed to permit it.<br>
13 For the priest we are talking about belongs to a different tribe, whose members have never served at the altar as priests.<br>
14 What I mean is, our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses never mentioned priests coming from that tribe.<br>
15 This change has been made very clear since a different priest, who is like Melchizedek, has appeared.<br>
16 Jesus became a priest, not by meeting the physical requirement of belonging to the tribe of Levi, but by the power of a life that cannot be destroyed.<br>
17<br>
And the psalmist pointed this out when he prophesied,<br>
"You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."<br>
(Psalms 110:4)<br>
<br>
18 Yes, the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless.<br>
19 For the law never made anything perfect. But now we have confidence in a better hope, through which we draw near to God.<br>
20 This new system was established with a solemn oath. Aaron's descendants became priests without such an oath,<br>
21<br>
but there was an oath regarding Jesus. For God said to him,<br>
"The Lord has taken an oath and will not break his vow:<br>
'You are a priest forever.'"<br>
(quoting again from Psalms 110:4)<br>
<br>
<br>
22 Because of this oath, Jesus is the one who guarantees this better covenant with God.<br>
23 There were many priests under the old system, for death prevented them from remaining in office.<br>
24 But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood lasts forever.<br>
<br>
(Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him.)<br>
25 Therefore he is able, once and forever, to save those who come to God through him. He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf.<br>
<br>
26 He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin. He has been set apart from sinners and has been given the highest place of honour in heaven.<br>
(He has been exalted higher than the heavens.)<br>
<br>
<br>
27 Unlike those other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices every day. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people's sins.<br>
28 The law appointed high priests who were limited by human weakness. But after the law was given, God appointed his Son with an oath, and his Son has been made the perfect High Priest forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Here is the main point: We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honour beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle (in the heavenly tent); the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands.<br>
<br>
<br>
3 And since every high priest is required to offer gifts and sacrifices, our High Priest must make an offering, too.<br>
4 If he were here on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there already are priests who offer the gifts required by the law.<br>
5 They serve in a system of worship that is only a copy, a shadow of the real one in heaven. For when Moses was getting ready to build the Tabernacle, God gave him this warning: "Be sure that you make everything according to the pattern I have shown you here on the mountain."<br>
(quoting Exodus 25:40 and Exodus 26:30)<br>
6 But now Jesus, our High Priest, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant with God, based on better promises.<br>
7 If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it.<br>
8<br>
But when God found fault with the people, he said:<br>
"The day is coming, says the Lord,<br>
when I will make a new covenant<br>
with the people of Israel and Judah.<br>
9<br>
This covenant will not be like the one<br>
I made with their ancestors<br>
when I took them by the hand<br>
and led them out of the land of Egypt.<br>
They did not remain faithful to my covenant,<br>
so I turned my back on them, says the Lord.<br>
10<br>
But this is the new covenant I will make<br>
(with the people of Israel after those days,)<br>
with the people of Israel on that day, says the Lord:<br>
<br>
<br>
I will put my laws in their minds,<br>
and I will write them on their hearts.<br>
I will be their God,<br>
and they will be my people.<br>
<br>
11<br>
And they will not need to teach their neighbours,<br>
nor will they need to teach (their brother, nor will they need to teach) their relatives,<br>
saying, 'You should know the Lord.'<br>
For everyone, from the least to the greatest,<br>
will know me already.<br>
<br>
12<br>
And I will forgive their wickedness,<br>
and I will never again remember their sins."<br>
(quoting from Jeremiah 31:31-34)<br>
<br>
<br>
13<br>
When God speaks of a "new" covenant, it means he has made the first one obsolete. It is now out of date and will soon disappear.<br>
1<br>
That first covenant between God and Israel had regulations for worship and a place of worship here on earth.<br>
2<br>
There were two rooms in that (tent, in that) Tabernacle.<br>
<br>
In the first room were a lampstand, a table, and sacred loaves of bread on the table. This room was called the Holy Place.<br>
3 Then there was a curtain, and behind the curtain was (the second tent,) the second room called the Most Holy Place.<br>
4 In that room were a gold incense altar and a wooden chest called the Ark of the Covenant, which was covered with gold on all sides. Inside the Ark were a gold jar containing manna, Aaron's staff that sprouted leaves, and the stone tablets of the covenant.<br>
5 Above the Ark were the cherubim of divine glory, whose wings stretched out over the Ark's cover, the place of atonement. But we cannot explain these things in detail now.<br>
6 When these things were all in place, the priests regularly entered the first room (the first tent,) as they performed their religious duties.<br>
<br>
7 But only the high priest ever entered the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. And he always offered blood for his own sins and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.<br>
<br>
(By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the first room, the first tent, and the system it represented were still in use.)<br>
8 By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the Tabernacle and the system it represented were still in use.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them.<br>
10 For that old system deals only with food and drink and various cleansing ceremonies -- physical regulations that were in effect only until a better system could be established.<br>
<br>
11 So Christ has now become the High Priest over all the good things that have come (and that are about to come). He has entered that greater, more perfect Tabernacle in heaven, which was not made by human hands and is not part of this created world.<br>
<br>
<br>
12 With his own blood -- not the blood of goats and calves -- he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time and secured our redemption forever.<br>
13 Under the old system, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer could cleanse people's bodies from ceremonial impurity.<br>
<br>
14 Just think how much more the blood of Christ will purify our consciences from sinful deeds (and from dead works) so that we can worship the living God. For by the power of the eternal Spirit, Christ offered himself to God as a perfect sacrifice for our sins.<br>
<br>
15 That is why he is the one who mediates a new covenant between God and people, so that all who are called can receive the eternal inheritance God has promised them. For Christ died to set them free from the penalty of the sins they had committed under that first covenant.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And that spot right there where we stopped was Hebrews 9, verse 15, NLT.<br>
Finally, here in Chapter 9, let's skip down to verse 27 and 28, the last two verses of chapter 9,<br>
and we will keep reading into Hebrews 10, verses 1 through 7.<br>
<br>
27 And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgement,<br>
28 so also Christ was offered once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again, not to deal with our sins, but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him.<br>
1 The old system under the law of Moses was only a shadow, a dim preview of the good things to come, not the good things themselves. The sacrifices under that system were repeated again and again, year after year, but they were never able to provide perfect cleansing for those who came to worship.<br>
2 If they could have provided perfect cleansing, the sacrifices would have stopped, for the worshipers would have been purified once for all time, and their feelings of guilt would have disappeared.<br>
3 But instead, those sacrifices actually reminded them of their sins year after year.<br>
4 For it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.<br>
<br>
5<br>
That is why, when Christ came into the world, he said to God,<br>
<br>
"You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings.<br>
But you have given me a body to offer.<br>
6<br>
You were not pleased with burnt offerings<br>
or other offerings for sin.<br>
7<br>
Then I said, 'Look, I have come to do your will, O God --<br>
as is written about me in the Scriptures.'"<br>
(This is a quote from the Greek version of Psalms 40:6-8)<br>
<br>
<br>
To summarise again what we have gone through here in the book of Hebrews...<br>
We started in chapter 4, and read all the way into Chapter 10.<br>
<br>

2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:<br>

Here is a commentary from<br>

<br>
We are unable to immediately identify the Bible translation that the pastor is using.<br>
We do not recognise the Bible translation that is quoted in this commentary.<br>
The pastor is using a Bible translation that we do not officially recognise or trust as an accurate Bible translation.<br>
Nevertheless, whatever translation it is, it seems to be good enough for him to have provided this interesting commentary.<br>
<br>
Let us now read Pastor Mark Scholtz's commentary:<br>
<br>
God had a purpose for Abraham – He said: "I will make you into a great nation. I will bless you and make you famous, and you will be a blessing to others." Abraham's purpose was to be a blessing to the rest of the world, but in order for Abraham to fulfil his purpose, he had to position himself in obedience to God. God said: "Leave your native country, your relatives, and your father's family, and go to the land that I will show you." As Abraham positioned himself by going on the journey set before him, God provided everything that was needed on the way. God even provided their own flesh and blood son through whom the promise would be fulfilled. They had not been able to have their own children in their youth and yet now when they were both too old, God gave them a son! God always provides what is needed for us to fulfil our purpose when we position ourselves in obedience to Him. Purpose, Position and Provision are closely linked in God's Kingdom.<br>
<br>
<br>
Position is where you live, where you work, which church family you belong to, how you live your life and in fact any obedient step you need to take. Provision is material provision, the right support structures, the people you need around you and the gifting and anointing you need to accomplish what He's set before you. To fulfil your Purpose you need to be correctly Positioned and then in your correct Position God Provisions you. Sometimes the Provision isn't what we expect or even what we would hope for, but it will always be enough to accomplish your God-given Purpose. I live in the understanding that if I don't have something I feel I need then I don't need it right then. Jesus did not even withhold the blood in His veins when I needed it to atone for my sin, so why would He withhold anything else from me?  If I don't have it, then I don't need it yet and I need to trust God despite my restrictions. If Paul could advance the Kingdom from the restriction of a prison then no restriction we feel we might have can stop us either! What's important is that we Position ourselves correctly.<br>
<br>
"As scary as it might be, you have to move to your new Position, because that's where your Purpose and new Provision now lie"<br>
<br>
Sometimes your Purpose is where you are currently Positioned, so you need to remain where you are. Sometimes your Purpose moves to a new Position, so you need to change Position. If you're at "A" then "A" is where your Purpose and your Provision will be found. Then God says I have an assignment for you at "B". Like Abraham, your Purpose just moved to B and your new Provision just moved to B too. You can't stay at "A". There's a well-worn phrase when you stay at "A" for too long. It's called "being out of God's will." As scary as it might be, you have to move to your new Position, because that's where your Purpose and new Provision now lie. We get scared of "B" when we're at "A", because we're trying to figure out how we'll accomplish "B" with "A's" provisioning. But, at B is new Provision. When you get to "B", you will get "B's" Provisioning which will enable you to do what you need to do. Sometimes we get scared of "B", because we know we won't have "A's" provisioning anymore. We've got comfortable with what we have at "A". If we don't move however, we miss the faith growing, mind blowing miracles waiting for us at "B". At "B", barren wombs come to life.<br>
<br>
Purpose, Position and Provision are all interconnected. God has a Purpose for you. In order to fulfil your purpose you need to Position yourself correctly. In your God ordained Position, there is Provision – everything you need to get the job done.<br>
<br>
And that concludes the quoted commentary from,<br>

<br>
Trust In You was then later released as a single on 22 January 2016, as the third single from her debut studio album, How Can It Be.<br>
This song became her first song to quickly climb the Billboard Magazine Hot Christian Songs chart and reach Number 1, staying at Number 1 for eighteen weeks (four and a half months).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2015 song, Trust In You, by Lauren Daigle...<br>
<br>
Letting go of every single dream<br>
I lay each one down at Your feet<br>
Every moment of my wondering<br>
Never changes what You see<br>
<br>
I've tried to win this war I confess<br>
My hands are weary I need Your rest<br>
Mighty Warrior King of the fight<br>
No matter what I face You're by my side<br>
<br>
<br>
When You don't move the mountains<br>
I'm needing You to move<br>
When You don't part the waters<br>
I wish I could walk through<br>
When You don't give the answers<br>
As I cry out to You<br>
I will trust, I will trust<br>
I will trust in You<br>
<br>
Truth is You know what tomorrow brings<br>
There's not a day ahead You have not seen<br>
So in all things be my life and breath<br>
I want what You want Lord and nothing less<br>
<br>
<br>
When You don't move the mountains<br>
I'm needing You to move<br>
When You don't part the waters<br>
I wish I could walk through<br>
When You don't give the answers<br>
As I cry out to You<br>
I will trust, I will trust<br>
I will trust in You<br>
I will trust in You<br>
<br>
<br>
You are my strength and comfort<br>
You are my steady hand<br>
You are my firm foundation<br>
The Rock on which I stand<br>
<br>
Your ways are always higher<br>
Your plans are always good<br>
There's not a place where I'll go<br>
You've not already stood<br>
<br>
<br>
When You don't move the mountains<br>
I'm needing You to move<br>
When You don't part the waters<br>
I wish I could walk through<br>
When You don't give the answers<br>
As I cry out to You<br>
I will trust, I will trust<br>
I will trust in You<br>
I will trust in You<br>
I will trust in You<br>
I will trust in You<br>

Commentary:<br>
Are you willing to let go of your love of money slavery and follow Christ, even if it means, spiritually speaking, you may need to wander in a wilderness in your journey to a promised land and a spirit-filled life?<br>
The threat of poverty, homelessness and rough sleeping, and yet going to be saved and live forever in heaven, is still better than<br>
being enslaved to all the worldly comforts, and the love of money and selfishness and spending forever in an actual, real place called hell.<br>
<br>
Is Hell forever?  I met someone who believed that one is in hell for a limited duration of time, then they die.<br>
That is not true.  That is not what the Bible teaches.<br>
If someone is teaching you that, or they are telling you that hell does not actually exist, then that person is just another anti-christ and you should avoid liars like that and the so-called churches that they inhabit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In Mark 9:43 and Mark 9:45, hell is described by Jesus as, hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:<br>
<br>
Mark 9:48 (NLT)<br>
and be thrown into hell, 'where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.'<br>
<br>
Mark 9:48 (KJV)<br>
...to be cast into hell fire: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.<br>
<br>
Jesus Christ is quoting from...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 66:24 (KJV)<br>
And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 66:24 (NLT)<br>
And as they go out, they will see the dead bodies of those who have rebelled against me. For the worms that devour them will never die, and the fire that burns them will never go out. All who pass by will view them with utter horror."<br>
<br>
Jesus Christ is the one who is using the description of Isaiah 66:24 and letting us know that this is a description of hell.<br>
<br>
Jesus Christ is attaching the word, hell, to this description, making it clear that he is describing one who is in hell.<br>
<br>
Matthew 18:8 (KJV)<br>
everlasting fire.<br>
<br>
Matthew 18:8 (NLT)<br>
eternal fire<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 25:41 (KJV)<br>
Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:<br>
<br>
Matthew 25:41 (NLT)<br>
"Then the King will turn to those on the left and say, 'Away with you, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 25:46 (KJV)<br>
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment....<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 25:46 (NLT)<br>
"And they will go away into eternal punishment....<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 20:10 (KJV)<br>
And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.<br>
<br>
Revelation 20:10 (NLT)<br>
Then the devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the fiery lake of burning sulphur, joining the beast and the false prophet. There they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 14:11 (KJV)<br>
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night,....<br>
<br>
Revelation 14:11 (NLT)<br>
The smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or night, for they have worshiped the beast and his statue and have accepted the mark of his name."<br>
<br>
<br>
Jude 1:7 (KJV)<br>
Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.<br>
<br>
Jude 1:7 (NLT)<br>
And don't forget Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring towns, which were filled with immorality and every kind of sexual perversion. Those cities were destroyed by fire and serve as a warning of the eternal fire of God's judgement.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 1: 8 & 9 -- KJV<br>
...the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,<br>
8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:<br>
9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 1: 8 & 9 -- NLT<br>
...when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven, He will come with his mighty angels,<br>
8 in flaming fire, bringing judgement on those who don't know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus.<br>
9 They will be punished with eternal destruction, forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power.<br>

<br>
<br>
Triple Denial and Reversal<br>
<br>
<br>
The Triple Denial<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 26:34 (KJV)<br>
Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br>
<br>
Matthew 26 KJV<br>
Verses 26 to 35, then we jump down and read verse 56, 57 and 58,<br>
then we skip down to Verses 69 through 75, which is at the end of Matthew 26 KJV.<br>
<br>
26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.<br>
27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;<br>
28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.<br>
29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.<br>
30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.<br>
31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.<br>
32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.<br>
33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.<br>
34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br>
35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.<br>
<br>
Next, Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested, and right after that, if we jump down now to verse 56, it says...<br>
<br>
56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.<br>
57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.<br>
58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.<br>
<br>
Next, we jump down to verse 69 and read to verse 75.<br>
<br>
69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.<br>
70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.<br>
71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.<br>
72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.<br>
73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech betrayeth thee.<br>
74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.<br>
75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 26 NLT<br>
Verses 26 to 35, then we jump down and read verse 56, 57 and 58,<br>
then we skip down to Verses 69 through 75, which is at the end of Matthew 26 NLT.<br>
<br>
26 As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it, for this is my body."<br>
27 And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them and said, "Each of you drink from it,<br>
28 for this is my blood, which confirms the covenant (the new covenant) between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many.<br>
29 Mark my words -- I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom."<br>
30 Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.<br>
31<br>
On the way, Jesus told them, "Tonight all of you will desert me. For the Scriptures say,<br>
'God will strike (I will strike) the Shepherd,<br>
and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'<br>
(referring to Zechariah 13:7)<br>
<br>
32 But after I have been raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there."<br>
33 Peter declared, "Even if everyone else deserts you, I will never desert you."<br>
34 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, Peter -- this very night, before the cockerel crows, you will deny three times that you even know me."<br>
35 "No!" Peter insisted. "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the other disciples vowed the same.<br>
<br>
Next, Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested, and right after that, if we jump down now to verse 56, it says...<br>
<br>
56 But this is all happening to fulfil the words of the prophets as recorded in the Scriptures." At that point, all the disciples deserted him and fled.<br>
57 Then the people who had arrested Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of religious law and the elders had gathered.<br>
58 Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and came to the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards and waited to see how it would all end.<br>
<br>
69 Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came over and said to him, "You were one of those with Jesus the Galilean."<br>
70 But Peter denied it in front of everyone. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.<br>
71 Later, out by the gate, another servant girl noticed him and said to those standing around, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth (Jesus the Nazarene)."<br>
72 Again Peter denied it, this time with an oath. "I don't even know the man," he said.<br>
73 A little later some of the other bystanders came over to Peter and said, "You must be one of them; we can tell by your Galilean accent."<br>
74 Peter swore, "A curse on me if I'm lying -- I don't know the man!" And immediately the cockerel (the rooster) crowed.<br>
75 Suddenly, Jesus' words flashed through Peter's mind: "Before the cockerel crows, you will deny three times that you even know me." And he went away, weeping bitterly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 14:22-31, then verse 50, then verses 66 through 72, which is the end of Chapter 14. (KJV)<br>
22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.<br>
23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.<br>
24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.<br>
25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.<br>
26 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.<br>
27 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.<br>
28 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.<br>
29 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.<br>
30 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br>
31 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.<br>
<br>
Next, we will jump down to verse 50.<br>
Right after Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested, it says here in verse 50...<br>
<br>
50 And they all forsook him, and fled.<br>
<br>
And then, in verses 66 through 72...<br>
<br>
66 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:<br>
67 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.<br>
68 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.<br>
69 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.<br>
70 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.<br>
71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.<br>
72 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 14:22-31, then verse 50, then verses 66 through 72, which is the end of Chapter 14. (NLT)<br>
<br>
22 As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take it, for this is my body."<br>
23 And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them, and they all drank from it. <br>
24 And he said to them, "This is my blood, which confirms the covenant (the new covenant) between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice for many. <br>
25 I tell you the truth, I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God."<br>
26 Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.<br>
27<br>
On the way, Jesus told them, "All of you will desert me. For the Scriptures say,<br>
'God will strike (I will strike) the Shepherd,<br>
and the sheep will be scattered.'<br>
(referencing the book of Zechariah 13:7)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
28 But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there."<br>
29 Peter said to him, "Even if everyone else deserts you, I never will."<br>
30 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, Peter -- this very night, before the cockerel (the rooster) crows twice, you will deny three times that you even know me."<br>
31 "No!" Peter declared emphatically. "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the others vowed the same.<br>
<br>
Jumping again down to verse 50<br>
Right after Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested, it says here in verse 50, in the NLT...<br>
50 Then all his disciples deserted him and ran away.<br>
<br>
66 Meanwhile, Peter was in the courtyard below. One of the servant girls who worked for the high priest came by<br>
67 and noticed Peter warming himself at the fire. She looked at him closely and said, "You were one of those with Jesus of Nazareth (Jesus the Nazarene)."<br>
68 But Peter denied it. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said, and he went out into the entryway. Just then, a cockerel crowed (a rooster crowed).<br>
69 When the servant girl saw him standing there, she began telling the others, "This man is definitely one of them!"<br>
70<br>
But Peter denied it again.<br>
A little later some of the other bystanders confronted Peter and said, "You must be one of them, because you are a Galilean."<br>
71<br>
Peter swore, "A curse on me if I'm lying -- I don't know this man you're talking about!"<br>
72 And immediately the cockerel (the rooster) crowed the second time.<br>
Suddenly, Jesus' words flashed through Peter's mind: "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny three times that you even know me." And he broke down and wept.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 22:31-34, and then verses 54 through 62 (KJV)<br>
31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:<br>
32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.<br>
33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.<br>
34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.<br>
<br>
Shortly after that, we have the part where Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives.<br>
Let's jump down to verse 54, in the part afterwards, after Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested.<br>
<br>
<br>
54 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.<br>
55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.<br>
56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.<br>
57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.<br>
58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.<br>
59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.<br>
60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, whilst he yet spake, the cock crew.<br>
61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br>
62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 22:31-34, and then verses 54 through 62 (NLT)<br>
<br>
31"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat.<br>
32But I have pleaded in prayer for you, Simon, that your faith should not fail. So when you have repented and turned to me again, strengthen your brothers."<br>
33Peter said, "Lord, I am ready to go to prison with you, and even to die with you."<br>
34But Jesus said, "Peter, let me tell you something. Before the cockerel (the rooster) crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me."<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, after Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives, Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested.<br>
Let's continue reading at verse 54, in the NLT...<br>
<br>
54 So they arrested him and led him to the high priest's home. And Peter followed at a distance.<br>
55 The guards lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter joined them there.<br>
56 A servant girl noticed him in the firelight and began staring at him. Finally she said, "This man was one of Jesus' followers!"<br>
57 But Peter denied it. "Woman," he said, "I don't even know him!"<br>
58<br>
After a while someone else looked at him and said, "You must be one of them!"<br>
"No, man, I'm not!" Peter retorted.<br>
59 About an hour later someone else insisted, "This must be one of them, because he is a Galilean, too."<br>
60 But Peter said, "Man, I don't know what you are talking about." And immediately, whilst he was still speaking, the cockerel crowed.<br>
61 At that moment the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Suddenly, the Lord's words flashed through Peter's mind: "Before the cockerel crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me."<br>
62 And Peter left the courtyard, weeping bitterly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 13:36-38 (KJV)<br>
36 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.<br>
37 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.<br>
38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 13:36-38 (NLT)<br>
36<br>
Simon Peter asked, "Lord, where are you going?"<br>
And Jesus replied, "You can't go with me now, but you will follow me later."<br>
37 "But why can't I come now, Lord?" he asked. "I'm ready to die for you."<br>
38 Jesus answered, "Die for me? I tell you the truth, Peter -- before the cockerel crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 18: verse 15-18 and then verse 25-27 -- KJV<br>
15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.<br>
16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.<br>
17 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.<br>
18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.<br>
<br>
After that, The High Priest Questions Jesus. Now, let's jump down to verse 25...<br>
<br>
25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.<br>
26 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?<br>
27 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 18: verse 15-18 and then verse 25-27 -- NLT<br>
15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another of the disciples. That other disciple was acquainted with the high priest, so he was allowed to enter the high priest's courtyard with Jesus.<br>
16 Peter had to stay outside the gate. Then the disciple who knew the high priest spoke to the woman watching at the gate, and she let Peter in.<br>
17<br>
The woman asked Peter, "You're not one of that man's disciples, are you?"<br>
"No," he said, "I am not."<br>
18<br>
Because it was cold, the household servants and the guards had made a charcoal fire. They stood around it, warming themselves, and Peter stood with them, warming himself.<br>
<br>
Next, The High Priest Questions Jesus, and then, if we jump down to verse 25 here in the NLT...<br>
<br>
25 Meanwhile, as Simon Peter was standing by the fire warming himself, they asked him again, "You're not one of his disciples, are you?"<br>
He denied it, saying, "No, I am not."<br>
26 But one of the household slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, "Didn't I see you out there in the olive grove with Jesus?"<br>
27 Again Peter denied it. And immediately a cockerel crowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, that is the triple denial.<br>
<br>
Earlier, just before Jesus told the Parable of the Unforgiving Debtor,<br>
Jesus said something about forgiveness, there in Matthew 18.<br>
<br>
Matthew 18: 21 & 22 (KJV)<br>
21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?<br>
22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.<br>
<br>
Matthew 18: 21 & 22 (NLT)<br>
21 Then Peter came to him and asked, "Lord, how often should I forgive someone (how often should I forgive my brother) who sins against me? Seven times?"<br>
<br>
<br>
22 "No, not seven times," Jesus replied, "but seventy times seven!  (seventy, seven times)<br>
<br>
Commentary: I do not see this saying 77 times, as in 70 plus 7.  I see it as seventy, seven times, as if you count to the number 70 and you do that 7 times.)<br>
That would be 490 times.  God is Love, and Love keeps no record of a wrong suffered, and the Lord Jesus is not counting your sins or even remembering your sins.<br>
If you believe in Jesus being your Lord and your Saviour, he has forgiven your sins so completely, that he has forgotten all about them.<br>
We need to love one another, being tender-hearted, forgiving one another. Have you forgiven everyone who has ever done you wrong?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
"when the sabbath was past" would be Sunday, the day after Saturday, the day after the sabbath.<br>
The original Greek language in Mark 16, verse 2, calls this day the first day of the week.<br>
That would make Saturday the seventh day of the week, the sabbath, the day of rest.<br>
The sabbath has always been on Saturday.  The seventh day of the week, the day of rest, has always been on Saturday.<br>
Saturday is the day of rest, the sabbath -- not Sunday.<br>
Who changed it to Sunday?  The Bible never did.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 16:1-8 (KJV)<br>
1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.<br>
2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.<br>
3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?<br>
4 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.<br>
5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.<br>
6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.<br>
7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.<br>
8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed....<br>
<br>
By the way, a little side note here, since we are near the end of the book of Mark, the Gospel of Mark...<br>
The most ancient manuscripts, and the most reliable early manuscripts of the Gospel of Mark conclude with chapter 16, stopping at verse 8.<br>
Later manuscripts add one or both of the following endings.<br>
The Shorter Ending of Mark includes additional content added to the end of verse 8.<br>
The Longer Ending of the book of Mark goes to chapter 16, verse 20.<br>
Other manuscripts include various endings to the Gospel. A few include both the "shorter ending" and the "longer ending."<br>
The majority of manuscripts include the "longer ending" immediately after verse 8, going to verse 20.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 16:1-8 (NLT)<br>
1 Saturday evening, when the Sabbath ended, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome went out and purchased burial spices so they could anoint Jesus' body.<br>
2 Very early on Sunday morning, (on the first day of the week,) just at sunrise, they went to the tomb.<br>
3 On the way they were asking each other, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"<br>
4 But as they arrived, they looked up and saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled aside.<br>
5 When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side. The women were shocked,<br>
6 but the angel said, "Don't be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, (Jesus the Nazarene) who was crucified. He isn't here! He is risen from the dead! Look, this is where they laid his body.<br>
7 Now go and tell his disciples, including Peter, that Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you before he died."<br>
8 The women fled from the tomb, trembling and bewildered....<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Did you notice something very important in verse seven?<br>
KJV: go your way, tell his disciples and Peter<br>
NLT: go and tell his disciples, including Peter,<br>
<br>
Peter was one of Jesus' disciples.<br>
The technical definition of, Jesus' disciples, would have automatically included Peter.<br>
Why did the angel have to say, and Peter, including Peter, if Peter was already one of Jesus' disciples?<br>
I believe that the Lord knew what was going on in Peter's mind, and what Peter was feeling in his heart.<br>
I imagine that Peter was probably thinking to himself that, because of his failure, because of his triple denial, that he felt like he was no longer one of Jesus' disciples.<br>
The angel wanted it to be very clear that, when they go and tell Jesus' disciples about his Resurrection, that they make sure that they include Peter, because Peter is still one of the disciples, even if he does not feel like he his at this time.<br>
That's why the angel very specifically mentioned Peter's name.<br>
Jesus died on that cross and He was Resurrected from the dead so that you can be in heaven with Him, living in His kingdom, forever, because He wants you to be with him forever, because He loves you with an everlasting love that never fails and never gives up.<br>
You are still a child of God, and you are still Jesus' friend, even when you fail, and you don't feel like you are.<br>
<br>
In the Longer Ending of the book of Mark, we read several amazing and important things, including this little bit right here...<br>
Mark 16: 15 & 16 -- KJV -- The Resurrected Jesus said,<br>
15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.<br>
16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.<br>
<br>
Mark 16: 15 & 16 -- NLT -- Jesus says to them,<br>
15 And then he told them, "Go into all the world and preach the Good News to everyone.<br>
16 Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved. But anyone who refuses to believe will be condemned.<br>
<br>
Now, let's look at the Triple Denial Reversal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Triple Denial Reversal<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's go back to the book of John and fast-forward towards the end.<br>
<br>
John 19<br>
Jesus is Sentenced to Death, and we then have The Crucifixion<br>
and The Death of Jesus, and then The Burial of Jesus.<br>
<br>
John 20:<br>
The Resurrection, then Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene<br>
and then Jesus Appears to His Disciples,<br>
and then Jesus Appears to Thomas.<br>
Chapter 20 ends with a few words about the Purpose of the Book.<br>
(The purpose and reason why this book of John was written.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, let's read in John, chapter 21, starting in verse 12, and we will read to the end of the book of John.<br>
The Resurrected Jesus Appears Again to the Seven Disciples whilst they were out fishing.<br>
Right after they obey Jesus, they catch 153 large fish, and yet the fishing net had not torn.<br>
<br>
John 21:12-25 -- The end of the book of John. (KJV)<br>
12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.<br>
13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.<br>
14 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.<br>
15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.<br>
16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.<br>
17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.<br>
18  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.<br>
19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.<br>
20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?<br>
21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?<br>
22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.<br>
23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?<br>
24 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.<br>
25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 21:12-25 -- The end of the book of John. (NLT)<br>
<br>
12 "Now come and have some breakfast!" Jesus said. None of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.<br>
13 Then Jesus served them the bread and the fish.<br>
14 This was the third time Jesus had appeared to his disciples since he had been raised from the dead.<br>
15<br>
After breakfast Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you love me more than these? (More than these others do?)"<br>
<br>
"Yes, Lord," Peter replied, "you know I love you."<br>
"Then feed my lambs," Jesus told him.<br>
16<br>
Jesus repeated the question: "Simon son of John, do you love me?"<br>
"Yes, Lord," Peter said, "you know I love you."<br>
"Then take care of my sheep," Jesus said.<br>
17<br>
A third time he asked him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?"<br>
Peter was hurt that Jesus asked the question a third time. He said, "Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you."<br>
Jesus said, "Then feed my sheep.<br>
18 "I tell you the truth, when you were young, you were able to do as you liked; you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go.<br>
(But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another one will dress you and take you where you don't want to go.)<br>
But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and others will dress you and take you where you don't want to go."<br>
<br>
<br>
19 Jesus said this to let him know by what kind of death he would glorify God. Then Jesus told him, "Follow me."<br>
20 Peter turned around and saw behind them the disciple Jesus loved -- the one who had leaned over to Jesus during supper and asked, "Lord, who will betray you?"<br>
21 Peter asked Jesus, "What about him, Lord?"<br>
22 Jesus replied, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? As for you, follow me."<br>
<br>
<br>
23 So the rumour spread among the community of believers (So the rumour spread among the community of the brothers) that this disciple wouldn't die. But that isn't what Jesus said at all. He only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"<br>
<br>
<br>
24 This disciple is the one who testifies to these events and has recorded them here. And we know that his account of these things is accurate.<br>
<br>
25 Jesus also did many other things. If they were all written down, I suppose the whole world could not contain the books that would be written.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Do not judge and compare yourself with others.<br>
Jesus is saying this to you and me in verse 22.<br>
Do not be concerned with what other people are doing, or how much of what you think they are or are not doing.<br>
As for you, follow Jesus. As far as you are concerned, just keep your eyes on Jesus and follow him.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, verse 25 was made into an interesting hymn by Frederick M. Lehman.<br>
He was born in 1868 and died in 1953.<br>
He wrote a hymn, titled, Love of God, in 1917.<br>
In verse 3, it said,<br>
Could we with ink the ocean fill,<br>
And were the skies of parchment made;<br>
Were ev'ry stalk on earth a quill,<br>
And ev'ry man a scribe by trade;<br>
To write the love of God above<br>
Would drain the ocean dry;<br>
Nor could the scroll contain the whole<br>
Tho' stretched from sky to sky. <br>
<br>
Pastor Chuck Smith loved singing this hymn many times in his final year before he passed away on 3 October 2013.<br>
<br>
Let's go back to the part where Jesus was asking Peter three times if he loved him.<br>
<br>
Next, we will use our usual collection of reference materials.<br>
They include the following...<br>
<br>
Strong's Greek and Hebrew Dictionary,<br>
Short lemma definitions from Perseus Digital Library,<br>

<br>
<br>
Jesus used a Greek word for love, and Peter used a slightly different Greek word for love.<br>
Upon the third asking, they finally decide to agree on using the same Greek word for love.<br>
Let's compare those two different Greek words that were both interpreted as the English word, "love".<br>
<br>
<br>
How to describe the love-word that they each used.<br>
1st Time:<br>
Jesus: to treat with affection, to caress, love, be fond of, to feel and exhibit esteem and goodwill to a person, to prize and delight<br>
Peter: to be a friend to, to approve of, to like, sanction, to treat affectionately or kindly, to welcome, befriend<br>
<br>
2nd Time:<br>
Jesus: to treat with affection, to caress, love, be fond of, to feel and exhibit esteem and goodwill to a person, to prize and delight<br>
Peter: to be a friend to, to approve of, to like, sanction, to treat affectionately or kindly, to welcome, befriend<br>
<br>
3rd Time:<br>
Jesus: to be a friend to, to approve of, to like, sanction, to treat affectionately or kindly, to welcome, befriend<br>
Peter: to be a friend to, to approve of, to like, sanction, to treat affectionately or kindly, to welcome, befriend<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's see if we can take these two different Greek words for love, and try to show the difference in English words.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
1st Time:<br>
Jesus: Do you love me with an everlasting love, no matter what, more than anything or anyone else?<br>
Peter: I like you, and I love you as my friend.<br>
<br>
Jesus: Feed my little lambs.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
2nd Time:<br>
Jesus: Do you love me with an everlasting love, no matter what?<br>
Peter: You know that I like you, and that I love you as my friend.<br>
<br>
Jesus: Feed my sheep or anything else that walks forward.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
3rd Time:<br>
Jesus: Peter, do you like me?  Do you love me? Are you my friend?<br>
Peter: (he has pain, distress, and grieves because Jesus asks him a third time.)<br>
(I think Peter realises that he is being asked this three times, because he denied Jesus three times.)<br>
Lord, you know everything, and you know that I love you as my friend.<br>
<br>
Jesus: Feed my sheep or anything else that walks forward.<br>
Verse 19, Jesus:  Peter, accompany me as my disciple, and follow me.<br>
Join me as my attendant, and accompany me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Not everyone wants to walk forward.<br>
Feed those that want to walk forward, and want to walk forward and through the valley of the shadow of death.<br>
Standing still, laying down, looking back, walking backwards, and walking around in circles, in cycles of dysfunction, walking around in circles is not walking forward.<br>
Those who try to walk forward but keep looking back are not fit for the Kingdom of God.<br>
Don't try to feed those that are not walking forward.<br>
<br>
Do you love Jesus more than anyone else or anything else?<br>
Let me say that again.<br>
Do you love Jesus more than anyone else or anything else?<br>
Are you willing to love him first, and seek him first?<br>
Are you making sure that you have no other gods before him?<br>
That is the first of the Ten Commandments.<br>
When you are upset, distressed, or in trouble, who do you turn to first?<br>
What do you turn to first?<br>
Do you turn first to...<br>
A person, a phone call, a food, a pill, a website? A job, a place, a bar, tavern or pub? A book of old photographs? The past? The good, old days?<br>
Jesus?  Have you tried seeking him first instead?<br>
Go to Him first! Pray it up to Him first!<br>
When you are upset, distressed, or in trouble, immediately seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.<br>
<br>
Do you love Jesus more than anyone else or anything else?<br>
Or, do you just like him as a friend?<br>
How do you take your relationship with Jesus to the next level,<br>
or, are you waiting for him to come down to your level?<br>
When it comes to your heart and what you value and treasure, Jesus wants full-time custody, not just weekend visits.<br>
<br>
Prayer:<br>
Dear Lord Jesus,<br>
Help me love you with the same level of strength and intensity that you love me.<br>
Don't lower your amount of love for me down to my level of love for you.<br>
If I'm at level 3, and you are at level 7, help me also mature up to level 7, where you are.<br>
Don't lower yourself down to level 3 where I am, help me get up to level 7, where you are.<br>
I guess that is why you lowered yourself down to our level, so that you could be lifted up, so that we could be saved and lifted up to be in heaven with you.<br>
Don't let me deny you, or want to abandon you, when the government tries to persecute me, because I'm with you.<br>
Help me love you more, help me love you with the same strength and intensity of love that you have always had for me.<br>
Help me feed all of those that are willing to walk forward with you.<br>
Help me accompany you and follow you, and help me become your own very attentive attendant.<br>
In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.<br>

<br>
In the Book of Exodus, Moses leads Israel's Exodus from Egypt<br>
But, The Egyptians Pursue Israel in Exodus 14.<br>
We then read how the Lord makes it so that they Escape through the Red Sea, on dry ground.<br>
-- not muddy ground, nor even moist ground, but dry ground.<br>
<br>
Then, in Exodus 15, Moses and the people of Israel sing A Song of Deliverance.<br>
Let's pop in towards the end of the song, and see what happens next.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 15: verse 18 through 27, and then we will keep reading a little bit into the next chapter, Chapter 16, verses 1, 2 and 3 -- KJV<br>
18 The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.<br>
19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.<br>
20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.<br>
21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.<br>
22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.<br>
23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah (because, the name, Marah, means, Bitterness).<br>
24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?<br>
25 And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,<br>
26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee.<br>
27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.<br>
1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.<br>
2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:<br>
3 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 15: verse 18 through 27, and then we will keep reading a little bit into the next chapter, Chapter 16, verses 1, 2 and 3 -- NLT<br>
<br>
(By the way, when we get to verse 1 again, we should mention that, when the whole community of Israel set out from Elim and journeyed into the wilderness of Sin, that geographical name right there, Sin, is related to Sinai and should not be confused with the English word, sin.)<br>
(You can see the word, Sin, being a part of the spelling of the place, Sinai.)<br>
<br>
18 The Lord will reign forever and ever!"<br>
19 When Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and charioteers rushed into the sea, the Lord brought the water crashing down on them. But the people of Israel had walked through the middle of the sea on dry ground!<br>
20 Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine and led all the women as they played their tambourines and danced.<br>
21<br>
And Miriam sang this song:<br>
"Sing to the Lord,<br>
for he has triumphed gloriously;<br>
he has hurled both horse and rider<br>
into the sea."<br>
22 Then Moses led the people of Israel away from the Red Sea, and they moved out into the desert of Shur. They travelled in this desert for three days without finding any water.<br>
23 When they came to the oasis of Marah, the water was too bitter to drink. So they called the place Marah (which means "bitter").<br>
24 Then the people complained and turned against Moses. "What are we going to drink?" they demanded.<br>
25<br>
So Moses cried out to the Lord for help, and the Lord showed him a piece of wood. Moses threw it into the water, and this made the water good to drink.<br>
It was there at Marah that the Lord set before them the following decree as a standard to test their faithfulness to him.<br>
26 He said, "If you will listen carefully to the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in his sight, obeying his commands and keeping all his decrees, then I will not make you suffer any of the diseases I sent on the Egyptians; for I am the Lord who heals you."<br>
27 After leaving Marah, the Israelites travelled on to the oasis of Elim, where they found twelve springs and seventy palm trees. They camped there beside the water.<br>
<br>
<br>
(At his point, the Exodus had occurred exactly one month ago, on the fifteenth day of the first month.)<br>
(This date is also recorded in Numbers 33:3, in which it says in there, in the NLT, that they left the "city of Rameses in early spring -- on the fifteenth day of the first month -- on the morning after the first Passover celebration.")<br>
<br>
1 Then the whole community of Israel set out from Elim and journeyed into the wilderness of Sin, between Elim and Mount Sinai. They arrived there on the fifteenth day of the second month, one month after leaving the land of Egypt.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 There, too, the whole community of Israel complained about Moses and Aaron.<br>
3 "If only the Lord had killed us back in Egypt," they moaned. "There we sat around pots filled with meat and ate all the bread we wanted. But now you have brought us into this wilderness to starve us all to death."<br>
<br>
The Lord then provided Manna and Quail from Heaven, even though they were complaining and murmuring.<br>
Their complaining and murmuring happened many more times, and it did not do them any good at all when they did this.<br>
Their complaining and murmuring almost got them destroyed.<br>
Interesting how, when they did their complaining and murmuring, they did not get angry at God, mainly, but they got angry at the person who represented him here on earth.<br>
The community of Israel did not complain about the Lord God, they complained about Moses and Aaron.<br>
But, Moses and Aaron were just doing what the Lord told them to. The original orders originated from the Heavenly Father Lord God, but they got mad at Moses and Aaron.<br>
<br>
<br>
Manna was a mysterious, fine, flaky, bread-like substance that came down from Heaven and fed the Israelites for the 40 years of their wilderness wanderings.<br>
<br>
Commentary: They are longing for the good old days in Egypt when they had lots of different foods and things, but they are forgetting that, back in Egypt, they were also slaves!<br>
They were slaves, being abused and treated unfairly.<br>
Are you willing to let go of your love of money slavery and follow Christ, even if it means, spiritually speaking, you may need to wander in a wilderness in your journey to a promised land and a spirit-filled life?<br>
The threat of poverty, homelessness and rough sleeping, and yet going to be saved and live forever in heaven, is still better than<br>
being enslaved to all the worldly comforts, and the love of money and selfishness and spending forever in an actual, real place called hell.<br>

Chris Mountford is the Programme Controller of Cross Rhythms City Radio 101.8FM over in the city of Stoke-on-Trent.<br>
Stoke-on-Trent is about 158 miles north west of London, and about 45 miles north of Birmingham, England.<br>
Chris Mountford published this part of a commentary on 06 December 2019.<br>
The title of his commentary is, Being Thankful -- No Matter What.<br>
Here are selected quoted parts from his Commentary:<br>
In this chapter of Exodus, (Exodus 15,) it was only three days after God miraculously delivered the Israelites from the Egyptian army at the Red Sea before they were complaining about their predicament in the desert.  The writer's ink had barely dried on Moses' song of praise after the waters had parted in two before the people's moaning had begun.<br>
In tough times, if we do not practice having an attitude of thankfulness, we can be in danger of fooling ourselves about the bigger picture of our situation.  We can magnify the bad stuff and minimise positive things.<br>
(The solution?)<br>
Practise the discipline of giving thanks to God each day. The more you do it, the more reasons you will see to be very grateful.<br>
Giving thanks gives us a healthy perspective.<br>
<br>
Those were words quoted from Chris Mountford.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want to give some additional thought about being thankful,<br>
read all of Psalms 100. The entire Psalm is only five verses long.<br>
Psalms 100 was also shared with you on Christian Essays 5.<br>
Go there now if you want to read all five verses again.<br>
<br>
Psalms 100:4 (KJV)<br>
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.<br>
<br>
Psalms 100:4 (NLT)<br>
Enter his gates with thanksgiving; go into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him and praise his name.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
As mentioned a few times before...<br>
Pray...<br>
1. Praise Him, Praise His Name and What He has done, is doing, is going to do for you forever.<br>
2. Thank Him, Give Thanks, -- What are you thankful for? In everything give thanks.  Be thankful in every circumstance and situation.<br>
3. Confess your sin to Him, ask him to help you overcome and have Victory over that sin, and then pray, I thankfully receive your forgiveness!<br>
4. Pray for churches, pray for missions, pray for people trying to do Bible Studies.<br>
5. Pray for your needs.<br>
6. Pray for the needs of others.<br>

<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 10:12 (NLT)<br>
Oh, don't worry; we wouldn't dare say that we are as wonderful as these other men who tell you how important they are! But they are only comparing themselves with each other, using themselves as the standard of measurement. How ignorant!<br>

For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3: 10 & 11 (NLT)<br>
10 Because of God's grace to me, I have laid the foundation like an expert builder. Now others are building on it. But whoever is building on this foundation must be very careful.<br>
11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one we already have -- Jesus Christ.<br>

With those verses in mind,<br>
One of Lauren Daigle's first popular songs came from her first studio album, and the name of the song is, First, which is the first track on the album.<br>
<br>
Lauren Daigle's first studio album is titled, How Can It Be.<br>

<br>
And so, from the album, How Can It Be, here are the words to the 2015 song, First, by Lauren Daigle...<br>

Here are a few random Bible verses to think about...<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 8:11 (KJV)<br>
For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37:16 (KJV)<br>
A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.<br>
<br>
Psalms 63 is always an amazing Psalm to read again and again, like so many others.<br>
The first 8 verses, out of the 11 total verses of Psalms 63 were looked at<br>
a long time ago, back when we were in Christian Essays 5.<br>
We also looked at this verse in our list of the top 500+ most popular Bible verses.<br>
This verse happened to land at position number 260.<br>
Here it is again...<br>
For those who do not wish to be stuck any longer,<br>
for those who are trying to find their way to where better is, trying to get to better, His love for you, His lovingkindness is the "better" that you need.<br>
His lovingkindness is better.<br>
<br>
Psalms 63:3 (KJV)<br>
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.<br>
<br>
Psalms 63:3 (NLT)<br>
Your unfailing love is better than life itself; how I praise you!<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's read it one more time in the KJV, and add verse 4...<br>
Psalms 63: 3 & 4 (KJV)<br>
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.<br>
Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 73:23 (KJV)<br>
Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 73: 23 & 24 (NLT)<br>
I still belong to you;<br>
you hold my right hand.<br>
24<br>
You guide me with your counsel,<br>
leading me to a glorious destiny.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sabbath. Saturday? Sunday?  How about, not at all? Maybe. Sometimes?<br>
<br>
John 5:17 (NLT)<br>
But Jesus replied, "My Father is always working, and so am I."<br>
<br>
Just a little sample from John 5...<br>
John 5: 16-20 -- KJV<br>
16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.<br>
17 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.<br>
18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.<br>
19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.<br>
20 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.<br>
<br>
This part here is happening right after Jesus Heals a Lame Man.<br>
John 5: 16-20 -- NLT<br>
16 So the Jewish leaders began harassing (and persecuting) Jesus for breaking the Sabbath rules.<br>
17 But Jesus replied, "My Father is always working, and so am I."<br>
18 So the Jewish leaders tried all the harder to find a way to kill him. For he not only broke the Sabbath, he called God his Father, thereby making himself equal with God.<br>
19 So Jesus explained, "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.<br>
20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. In fact, the Father will show him how to do even greater works than healing this man. Then you will truly be astonished.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8:27 (KJV)<br>
And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8:26-29 (NLT)<br>
26 And the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness. For example, we don't know what God wants us to pray for. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words.<br>
27 And the Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers (the Spirit pleads for God's holy people) in harmony with God's own will.<br>
28 (And we know that everything works together,) And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.<br>
29 For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8:34 (KJV)<br>
Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.<br>
<br>
Romans 8: the end of verse 33, and verse 34 (NLT)<br>
...God himself has given us right standing with himself.<br>
34 Who then will condemn us? No one -- for Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of honour at God's right hand, pleading for us.<br>
<br>
<br>
We went over all of Isaiah 53 back when we were in Christian Essays 8.<br>
Isaiah 53:12 (KJV)<br>
Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.<br>

Isaiah 53: 11 & 12 (NLT)<br>
11<br>
When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish,<br>
he will be satisfied.<br>
And because of his experience,<br>
my righteous servant will make it possible<br>
for many to be counted righteous,<br>
for he will bear all their sins.<br>
12<br>
I will give him the honours of a victorious soldier,<br>
because he exposed himself to death.<br>
He was counted among the rebels.<br>
He bore the sins of many and interceded for rebels.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:14 (NLT)<br>
Wait patiently for the Lord. Be brave and courageous. Yes, wait patiently for the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 27:14 (KJV)<br>
Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 31:6 (NLT)<br>
So be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid and do not panic before them. For the Lord your God will personally go ahead of you. He will neither fail you nor abandon you."<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 31:6 (KJV)<br>
Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 16:13 (KJV)<br>
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 16:13 (NLT)<br>
Be on guard. Stand firm in the faith. Be courageous. Be strong.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 John 1:3 (KJV)<br>
Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.<br>
<br>
<br>
A little mention of the trinity, here...<br>
2 Corinthians 13:14 (KJV)<br>
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
KJV:<br>
Galatians 6:18<br>
Philemon 1:25<br>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What is the same verse found at...<br>
Galatians 1:3 (KJV)<br>
1 Corinthians 1:3 (KJV)<br>
2 Corinthians 1:2 (KJV)<br>
Ephesians 1:2 (KJV)<br>
Philippians 1:2 (KJV)<br>
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Talking here to the fellow believers...<br>
Here is a quote from the KJV.<br>
This same verse is found in...<br>
1 Corinthians 16:23<br>
Romans 16:24<br>
Philippians 4:23<br>
1 Thessalonians 5:28<br>
2 Thessalonians 3:18<br>
Revelation 22:21<br>
Romans 16:20<br>
<br>
That's seven Bible verses that all say the same thing...<br>
<br>
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.<br>
