Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

James 2: 15 & 16 -- KJV<br>
2:15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,<br>
2:16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?<br>
<br>
<br>
James 2: 15 & 16 -- NLT<br>
15 Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing,<br>
16 and you say, "Good-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well" -- but then you don't give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:19 -- KJV<br>
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:19 -- NLT<br>
And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 112:9 -- KJV<br>
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 112: 6-9 -- NLT<br>
...Those who are righteous will be long remembered.<br>
7<br>
They do not fear bad news;<br>
they confidently trust the Lord to care for them.<br>
8<br>
They are confident and fearless<br>
and can face their foes triumphantly.<br>
9<br>
They share freely and give generously to those in need.<br>
Their good deeds will be remembered forever.<br>
They will have influence and honour.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 9:6-10 -- KJV<br>
9:6 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.<br>
9:7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.<br>
9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:<br>
9:9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.<br>
9:10 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 9:6-10 -- NLT<br>
6 Remember this -- a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop. But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop.<br>
7 You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure. "For God loves a person who gives cheerfully."<br>
8 And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others.<br>
9 As the Scriptures say,<br>
"They share freely and give generously to the poor.<br>
Their good deeds will be remembered forever."<br>
(This is a quote from Psalms 112:9.)<br>
<br>
10 For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat.<br>
In the same way,<br>
(he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of righteousness in you.)<br>
he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 111:5 -- KJV<br>
(He hath given prey unto them that fear him:)<br>
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.<br>

He gives food to those who fear him;<br>
he always remembers his covenant.<br>
<br>

I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.<br>

For it was I, the Lord your God,<br>
who rescued you from the land of Egypt.<br>
Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it with good things.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 33: 18 & 19 -- KJV<br>

33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 33: 18 & 19 -- NLT<br>
18<br>
But the Lord watches over those who fear him,<br>
those who rely on his unfailing love.<br>
19<br>

and keeps them alive in times of famine.<br>

Luke 10: 19 & 20 -- KJV<br>

<br>
<br>
Luke 10: 19 & 20 -- NLT<br>

The next several sections contain Prayers for Release.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Prayers for Release have been a very special and important part of my family's daily routine.<br>
Since August of 2024, we have been reading the Morning and Evening prayers every single day.<br>
They have helped us keep our focus and our faith and our love for Him and for each other very blessed and strengthened.<br>
I would recommend that you read at least the morning and evening prayers every day, gathered around your entire family, reading them out loud to your family, and see if you also receive a healing and a blessing in yourself and in your family as well!<br>

Jesus is Salvation.<br>
To say that in Hebrew, one would say, Yaw-Who-Shaw is Yeh-Shoe-Uh.<br>
The Hebrew name for Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, will be spelled like this: Y a h s h u a<br>
in the prayers below. The word seen in the prayers below, as Yahshua<br>
should be pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw, which is the Hebrew way of saying, Jesus.<br>
<br>
The Father's name is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
The Lord's name is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
The Master's name is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
The Hebrew name for God is ELL-Low-Heem. It is spelled with a letter I in the TS2009. In the TS2009, it is spelled, E L o h i m.<br>
If you happen to read the Eth Cepher, the Eth Cepher will spell it with a letter Y instead of the letter I.<br>
<br>
The word, Ha'Satan, is pronounced, Ha-Saw-Tawn, which is the Hebrew word for satan.<br>
<br>
Technically, the Hebrew word, Ha, means, "The".<br>
So, Ha-Saw-Tawn, means The satan.<br>
We have seen this word, Ha, before, in previous Bible studies.<br>
Haw-Ah-Dome, is The Adam,<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw Ha-Muh-She-Uck, is Jesus The Christ.<br>
It still works if you remove the Ha.<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck, is Jesus Christ.<br>
Roo-Awk Haw-Coh-Desh, is, Spirit of The Holy, which is the Hebrew way of saying, Holy Spirit.<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Prayers for Release: MORNING PRAYER<br>
<br>
<br>
MORNING PRAYER<br>
<br>
Father, I declare that You are the One True Elohim, the Most High Elohim, the Elohim of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I ask You to forgive my sins and cleanse me of all unrighteousness, create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me. I plead the blood of Yahshua over my eyes and ears and over the eyes and ears of my family, so we can see and hear truth, and I ask You to shield us from all forms of mind control that can enter the eye gates and ear gates. I declare that we have access to the whole armour of Yahuah according to Ephesians 6; our loins are girt about with truth, and our feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. We have the breastplate of righteousness, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of Yahuah. As we commit our works unto You, our thoughts will be established according to Proverbs 16:3. Father, I ask You to apply the blood of Yahshua to any doors that I have open to the enemy that I am unaware of, and I ask You to reveal these doors to me so they can be closed forever.<br>
<br>
I take the authority that Yahshua gave me over all the power of the enemy according to Luke 10:19. I stand upon Your Word in Matthew 16:19 that I have been given the keys to the Kingdom and what I bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven, and what I loose on Earth will be loosed in Heaven. I take authority over the kingdom of darkness in every plain of existence that has access to me, and I bind the power of the enemy to affect me or my family, and I loose the power of the Kingdom of God to form impenetrable shields in every dimension -- above, below and all around, in the name of Yahshua.<br>
<br>
I stand upon the promise in Your Word that says that no weapon formed against me shall prosper, according to Isaiah 54:17. I stand upon the 91st Psalm that no evil shall befall me, neither shall any plague come nigh my dwelling. The 91st Psalm also promises that Your holy angels have been given charge over me and my family to keep us in all our ways. Father, I ask You to send extra angels for reinforcement during times of spiritual warfare, in Yahshua's name.<br>
<br>
Father, I ask You to forgive the sins of all of my ancestors (and the ancestors of my children and grandchildren), and I plead the blood of Yahshua over my DNA and the DNA of all of my descendants, which cleanses our bloodlines of all iniquity. I bind the power of any generational or familiar spirits to attach or influence us, and I loose the power of the Kingdom of Yahuah within us and around us as we keep Your commandments. I declare that our family is free to walk in the blessings of Deuteronomy 28.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 28: 1-14 -- TS2009<br>
1 "And it shall be, if you diligently obey the voice of Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem), to guard to do all His commands which I command you today, that Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim shall set you high above all nations of the earth.<br>
2 "And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, if you obey the voice of Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim:<br>
3 "Blessed are you in the city, and blessed are you in the field.<br>
4 "Blessed is the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground and the fruit of your livestock  --  the increase of your cattle and the offspring of your flocks.<br>
5 "Blessed is your basket and your kneading bowl.<br>
6 "Blessed are you when you come in, and blessed are you when you go out.<br>
7 "Yaw-Who-Wah causes your enemies who rise against you to be smitten before your face  --  they come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways.<br>
8 "Yaw-Who-Wah commands the blessing on you in your storehouses and in all to which you set your hand, and shall bless you in the land which Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim is giving you.<br>
9 "Yaw-Who-Wah does establish you as a set-apart people to Himself, as He has sworn to you, if you guard the commands of Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim and walk in His ways.<br>
10 "And all peoples of the earth shall see that the Name of Yaw-Who-Wah is called upon you, and they shall be afraid of you.<br>
11 "And Yaw-Who-Wah shall make you to have plenty of what is good, in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land of which Yaw-Who-Wah swore to your fathers to give you.<br>
12 "Yaw-Who-Wah opens to you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand. And you shall lend to many nations, but you do not borrow.<br>
13 "And Yaw-Who-Wah shall make you the head and not the tail. And you shall be only on top, and not be beneath, if you obey the commands of Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim, which I command you today, to guard and do.<br>
14 "And do not turn aside from any of the Words which I am commanding you today, right or left, to go after other mighty ones to serve them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I ask You to forgive the sins of all individuals being used by the enemy to combat our family (and ministry). I ask You to forgive the sins of all of their ancestors, and I plead the blood of Yahshua over their bloodlines all the way to the DNA level, breaking the power of iniquity. I ask You to break all of their occult power to the highest levels, making it impossible for them to be used by the kingdom of darkness to harm anyone. I ask You to save their souls, deliver and heal them. I plead the blood of Yahshua over every action and every word spoken against me and my family, nullifying the demonic power. I command any evil spirits sent on assignment against me and my family to return to the place they were sent from. I bind these spirits from harming those that sent them, but I pray that their defeat in their mission would serve as a testimony of Your greatness and the victory that Yahshua won for believers, in Yahshua's name. Father, I ask You to remove my DNA and the DNA of my family from any hair, blood or any other contact object in the hands of the enemy and break all conduits to our physical bodies, in Yahshua's name.<br>
<br>
Father, I ask You to forgive the sins that have allowed technology to be used as a weapon against Your creation. I ask You to place shields between me and my family and all broadcasts of the enemy through the airways, TVs, computers, phone lines, electric lines and satellites. I stand upon the promises in Your Word that You are our shield. I ask You to purify our air, water and food, in Yahshua's name. Father, I ask You to forgive the sins done on the roadways, railroad tracks, and waterways. I ask You to forgive the sins of any individuals or groups that have adopted the roadways, and I ask You to break any occult connections that would give power to the kingdom of darkness. Father, I ask You to provide divine protection during any modes of transportation. I ask You to surround our vehicles with Your holy angels to insure safe travel, in Yahshua's name. Father, lead me in paths of righteousness today and attune my ears to Your voice that I may follow You. I ask You to fill me with a hunger for your Word, that I may know You more. I give You all of my praise, my worship, the honour and the glory, in Yahshua's name.<br>

Prayers for Release: EVENING PRAYER<br>
<br>
<br>
EVENING PRAYER<br>
<br>
Father, I declare that You are the Elohim of our evenings as well as our days. I stand upon Psalm 91:5, 6 -- Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night or the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. I plead the blood of Yahshua over my family. I come into agreement with the promises in Your Word that my family is blessed physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I ask You to put impenetrable shields around our property, with armies of Your holy angels standing guard. I ask You to forgive the sins that have been done in the surrounding area, and I command the kingdom of darkness to clear our airways, grounds, and underneath, in Yahshua's name. Father, I bind any demons from entering our property. I ask You to forgive the sins that have enabled astral travel and I ask You to block that activity. I ask You to place hedges of protection around our family that humans cannot penetrate, either physically or through astral projection. I loose the power of the Kingdom of Yahuah to break the power of satanic surveillance. Father, I ask You to send Your holy angels to roadblock any attacks from the enemy. Father, because of Your faithfulness, we can go to sleep with full assurance that You are watching over us through the night. We ask all of these things in the Mighty Name of Yahshua.<br>

<br>
PRAYER FOR RELEASE FROM GENERATIONAL CURSES<br>
<br>
Father, I ask You to forgive all of the sins of our ancestors. I ask You to cover our bloodlines all the way to the DNA level with the blood of Yahshua, and I ask You to send the blood of Yahshua over the spiritual lines connecting us to those that we share DNA with, blocking any familiar spirits coming to us. We declare that Yahshua paid the price for us to be free of every generational curse, and we take our authority over all the power of the enemy according to Luke 10:19 and stand upon Matthew 16:19 that what we bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven and what we loose on Earth will be loosed in Heaven. We bind every familiar spirit and generational spirit that has attached to our family because of the iniquity on our bloodlines, and we command them to leave us, in Yahshua's name. We loose the power of the Kingdom of Yahuah within us and around us, and we ask for restoration of all that Ha'Satan (Ha-Saw-Tawn -- Satan) has stolen through these generational doorways (including our health, resources, joy and peace), in Yahshua's name.<br>

<br>
<br>
Prayer Compiled by Isaiah 54 Ministries<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 54 Ministries is a ministry of reconciliation.  Heeding the call of 2 Corinthians 5: 18 & 19, we work towards reconciliation between man and God, and between man and his fellow man through the Christian disciplines of Worship, Inner Healing and Spiritual Warfare.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 54 Ministries has compiled this article to help Christians become free from the curses brought upon themselves and their bloodline because of involvement with &#070;ree&#109;&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry and other secret organisations.<br>
<br>
The first step towards freedom is to understand the reasons that curses transfer through a family line.<br>
<br>
Iniquity & Idolatry bring generational curses. &#070;ree&#109;&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry's practices and doctrines are iniquities laced with idolatry. We believe, to facilitate healing more completely, the believer MUST, at the very least, understand this foundational concept.<br>
<br>
We have found that these prayers work best if done in the presence of experienced inner healing/deliverance counsellors.<br>
<br>
If you are being led to pursue deliverance from generational curses, or any other need for inner healing, please contact our ministry.<br>

If you were once a M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110; or are a descendant of a M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;, we recommend that you pray through the following prayer from your heart. Don't be like the M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;s who are given their obligations and oaths one line at a time and without prior knowledge of the requirements. Please read it through first so you know what is involved. It is best to then pray this aloud with a Christian witness or counsellor present who understands &#070;ree&#109;&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry and the dangers of secret societies. We suggest a brief pause following each paragraph to allow the Holy Spirit to show any additional issues that may require attention.<br>

"Father God. Creator of heaven and earth, I come to you in the name of Jesus Christ your Son. I come as a sinner seeking forgiveness and cleansing from all sins committed against you, and others made in your image.

Holy Spirit, I ask that you show me anything else which I need to do or to pray so that I and my family may be totally free from the consequences of the sins of M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry, Witchcraft, Mormonism and Paganism.<br>
<br>
(Pause, whilst listening to God, and pray as the Holy Spirit leads you.)<br>
<br>
Now dear Father God. I ask humbly for the blood of Jesus Christ, your Son, to cleanse me from all these sins I have confessed and renounced, to cleanse my spirit, my soul, my mind, my emotions and every part of my body which has been affected by these sins. In Jesus' name.<br>
<br>
I renounce every evil spirit associated with M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry, Witchcraft and all other sins. I command in The name of Jesus Christ for Satan and every evil spirit to be bound and to leave me now, touching or harming no-one, and go to the place appointed for you by the Lord Jesus, never to return to me or my family. I call on the name of the Lord Jesus to be delivered of these spirits, in accordance with the many promises of the Bible. I ask to be delivered of every spirit of sickness. Infirmity, curse, affliction, addiction, disease or allergy associated with these sins I have confessed and renounced. I surrender to God's Holy Spirit and to no other spirit all the places in my life where these sins have been. I ask you, Lord, to baptise me in your Holy Spirit now according to the promises in your Word. I take to myself the whole armour of God in accordance with Ephesians Chapter Six and rejoice in its protection as Jesus surrounds me and fills me with His Holy Spirit. I enthrone you, Lord Jesus, in my heart, for you are my Lord and my Saviour, the source of eternal life. Thank you, Father God, for your mercy, your forgiveness and your love, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.<br>
<br>
</p><hr><p>
<br>
NOTE:<br>
<br>
Christians should pray for M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;s without judging them. Bring their sins to God in an attitude of love, petitioning the Father for His mercy, binding in the name of Jesus Christ the spirits of deception, antichrist, witchcraft and death. Most men have no perception of the spiritual deception they have entered.<br>
<br>
Please remember that 'We do not wrestle against flesh and blood (your loved ones) but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places,' (Ephesians 6:12)<br>
<br>
This is a spiritual battle and should be treated accordingly.<br>

PRAYER FOR RELEASE FROM SOUL TIES<br>

<br>
<br>
PRAYER FOR RELEASE FROM SOUL TIES<br>
<br>
Father, I repent for every ungodly soul tie that I have made through sexual union. I apply the blood of Yahshua to the soul tie that I made with ____________. I ask You to sever the cord connecting me to this person with the Sword of the Spirit. I bind any demonic attachments that came to me, and I command them to leave me, in Yahshua's name. I loose the power of the Kingdom of Yahuah within me and around me to restore what was damaged by this soul tie. I ask You to seal the severed cord with the blood of Yahshua, so it can never be connected again, and I ask You to remove any foreign DNA from my body, in Yahshua's name. Father, I ask You to deliver every person from any spirits that were transferred to them from me, in Yahshua's name.<br>

<br>
<br>
PRAYER FOR VICTIMS OF TRAUMA AND FRAGMENTATION<br>
<br>
Father, I submit myself to You, spirit, soul and body, and I am so grateful for the price that Yahshua paid to make me whole. I ask You to forgive the sins of my abusers, and I ask You to sever all soul ties with them. I command any spirits that passed through the soul ties to leave me, in the name of Yahshua, and I ask You to seal those severed cords with the blood of Yahshua. As an act of my will, I choose to forgive every individual that has harmed me, in Yahshua's name. I take authority over my mind, and I bind gatekeepers and watchers and break their power over me, in the name of Yahshua. I loose the power of the Kingdom of Yahuah within me and around me, to overtake and override every plot and scheme of the enemy to hold me captive, in Yahshua's name. Father, I ask You to impart to me the anointing that destroys every yoke of bondage. I thank You for the promise of a sound mind in 2 Timothy 1:7.<br>
<br>
Father, I ask You to forgive the sins done to me that defiled Your Name, Your Word, and Your House, and I ask You to restore the truth of who You are to every part of my being. Father, I ask You to judge every demonic force that has been a part of my captivity since I was a child and deliver me. I plead the blood of Yahshua over every ritual performed and every oath, vow, contract and covenant made connecting me to the kingdom of darkness, and I ask You to set me free and bring me under the protection of Your Kingdom. Father, when I was a child I was taken against my will, but I now have authority through Yahshua over my tormentors, and I command them to let me go, in Yahshua's name. According to Psalm 142:7, I pray: Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name.<br>
<br>
Father, I ask You to make every doorway to blocked memories one-way doors, and I plead the blood of Yahshua into every area of my mind. I ask You to override any mind control programming that has been used as a weapon against me, as I stand upon Your Word in Isaiah 54:17 that no weapon formed against me shall prosper. I ask You to show me anything that I need to see to be free, but I ask that the overwhelming emotions would be buffered, to allow me to come to grips with the truth without further trauma. I place my healing in Your hands, and I place my trust in You.<br>
<br>
I bind any demons that are a part of my programming, and I loose the Spirit of Truth to counter and eradicate from my mind spirits of doubt and deception, in Yahshua's name. I ask forgiveness for the sins that caused my mind to fragment, and I command the past to let me go. Because You fill all space and time, I ask You to pour anointing oil on every fragment of my mind at the time that the splitting occurred. I claim the manifested healing and deliverance at this present time, and I declare that I am not a child any more; I am free to mature to my present age with restored peace and joy. I claim restoration of the years that Ha'Satan has stolen from me. I claim back my health, my resources, and my future, in Yahshua's name.<br>
<br>
I declare that I am a child of the King of the Universe, and I choose to follow the One True Elohim and declare that I have been set free from the kingdom of darkness, in Yahshua's name. I renounce all connections to Satanism, witchcraft, Druidism, and all other factions of the occult. Teach me Your ways so I can walk circumspectly before You each day, in Yahshua's name. Father, I ask You to forgive every sin done by every fragment of my being, including involvement in the occult. I renounce these powers and bind Ha'Satan's ability to use me in any way. I loose the sanctifying power of the blood of Yahshua to cover any gifts that You have given me, so I can flow in a pure stream of the Ruach Ha'Kodesh. Father, I repent for any forbidden activities, such as astral projection, and I take authority over my vessel and forbid any demons, humans, or mind control program to cause me to leave my body.I ask You to forgive the sins of every individual that I have been connected to in the occult, and I ask You to sever all connections so that I can never be accessed again, in Yahshua's name. I ask You to forgive the sins that allowed fragment exchanges between me and any other person, and I bind any demons connected to these exchanges. I ask You to block any humans with pernicious intent from contacting me. I ask You to hide any brain wave identification and block all satanic surveillance, in Yahshua's name. Father, place hedges of protection around me and surround me with armies of Your holy angels to block all activity directed against me in the spiritual or physical realms, in Yahshua's name. I take authority over and command every part of my being to stay within my physical body. Father, I place my sleep state in Your hands and trust You to keep me safe. Father, I ask You to reveal any additional information that is essential for my healing, in Yahshua's name.<br>

Here are the lyrics to another song by Devoted To Yah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Devoted To Yah<br>
is a band and Bible study group<br>
created by Darionel Serrano.<br>
The Devoted To Yah YouTube channel was first created on 30 September 2011.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the words to Devoted To Yah's<br>
2016 song, In the middle of the storm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The "Raw Recording" was uploaded to YouTube on 15 September 2016.<br>
The Raw Recording is a good acoustical recording,<br>
but it has lower sound quality.<br>
This is the one where he is wearing a blue shirt.<br>
<br>
<br>
A regular studio album version was uploaded to YouTube<br>
on 19 July 2017.<br>
It has some vocal Auto-Tune processing, and piano accompaniment.<br>
It fades out early. Not all of the ending lyrics are included.<br>
<br>
<br>
A second acoustical recording was uploaded onto YouTube on<br>
19 October 2018.<br>
The sound quality is much better than the Raw Recording.<br>
This is the one where he is wearing a red shirt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2016 song,<br>
In the middle of the storm, by Devoted To Yah.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm running<br>
I'm chasing<br>
for all the things that please Your heart<br>
but I feel like<br>
I'm being pushed back<br>
while many things seem to fall apart<br>
I am waiting for my breakthrough and<br>
I won't let go 'til you bless my soul<br>
<br>
and I just want to say<br>
<br>
In the middle of the storm, I run to You<br>                        
I reminisce on my before<br>
and how You brought me through<br>
I worship You for who You are<br>
not only what You do<br>
In the middle of the storm I will worship You<br>
Oooo, You<br>
Oooo<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I hear the voices<br>
of many mockers<br>
telling me it's not worth the fight<br>
but I keep watching<br>
I keep praying<br>
while many slumber through the night<br>
I am waiting for the sunrise<br>
to wash away the darkness of this world<br>
<br>
and I just want to say<br>
<br>
In the middle of the storm,<br>
I run to You<br>           
I reminisce on my before<br>
and how You brought me through<br>
I worship You for who You are<br>
not only what You do<br>
In the middle of the storm, I will worship You<br>
Oooo, You<br>
Oooo<br>
<br>
<br>
I know my future is secured in Your hands even though<br>
The fog of life is trying to blind me<br>
but I know The house I'm building is not standing on sand, so I'll go<br>
From faith to faith, glory to glory<br>
<br>
<br>
It's in the middle of the storm,<br>
I run to You<br>         
I reminisce on my before<br>
and how You brought me through<br>
I worship You for who You are<br>
not only what You do<br>
In the middle of the storm, I will worship You<br>
<br>
<br>
It's in the middle of the storm,<br>
I run to You<br>      
I reminisce on my before<br>
and how You brought me through<br>
I worship You for who You are<br>
not only what You do<br>
In the middle of the storm I will worship You<br>
Oooo, You<br>
Oooo, and I will worship<br>
<br>
<br>
I worship on the mountain top;<br>
and I will worship in the valley low<br>
and I will worship when life's unfair<br>
and I will worship when I'm in despair<br>
and I will worship through the hurt and pain<br>
and I will worship through the hurricane<br>
and I will worship in the day and night<br>
and I will worship 'til we reunite<br>
Even if they hate me and really want to kill me<br>
or put me in the fire;<br>
I know that You will save me but<br>
Even if You don't I still won't bow<br>
I won't back down or put my head to the ground<br>
HalleluYah I give you all the praise<br>
For the rest of my days I will bless Your only Name<br>
HalleluYah I give you all the praise<br>
For the rest of my days I will bless Your only Name<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yeah, I will bless your only name<br>

Commentary:<br>
<br>
A sin of omission is a sin that is the result of not doing something ELL-Low-Heem's Torah teaches that we should do.<br>
<br>
A sin of omission involves not doing what is right or failing to do as instructed.<br>
Refusing to share Christ with others, neglecting to care for those in need, and avoiding prayer are all examples of sins of omission.<br>
<br>
A sin of omission is when we neglect to do what we know is right.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let us now pray.<br>
Heavenly Father, Yaw-Who-Wah, and your only-begotten Son, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck,<br>
we call upon your name, the name above all names. We believe that Yaw-Who-Shaw is our Master.<br>
<br>
When we pray for ourselves, or when we pray for somebody else, or when we pray for our friends<br>

they are not to go to our other family members<br>
they are not to go to our friends or to other people in our life<br>

The King James Version (KJV) was first released in the year, 1611.<br>
<br>
The Geneva Bible was released 51 years before the King James Version (KJV) Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, we will read once again, an important and familiar bit of Scripture<br>
from Ephesians Chapter 6.<br>
<br>
But, this time, we will enjoy it in the Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560).<br>
<br>
<br>
Because the Geneva Bible has very old English spellings,<br>
we will adjust the English spellings so that this translation<br>
will be easy to read using the spelling of today's English.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6: 10-19 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.<br>
11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the assaults of the devil. <br>
12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, and against the worldly governors, the princes of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickednesses, which are in ye high places.<br>
13 For this cause take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to resist in the evil day, and having finished all things, stand fast.<br>
14 Stand therefore, and your loins girded about with veritie, and having on the breast plate of righteousness,<br>
15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace.<br>
16 Above all, take the shield of faith, wherewith ye may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked,<br>
17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<br>
18 And pray always with all manner prayer and supplication in the Spirit: and watch thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all Saints,<br>
19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly to publish the secret of the Gospel,<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's read it again with the Geneva Bible 1560 margin notes included.<br>
These are the 1560 margin notes, not the 1599 notes.<br>
The Geneva Bible 1560 margin notes, very difficult to find and read, are included here in round brackets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Old English word veritie (or veritas in Latin) means truth in modern English.<br>
Whilst it does not directly mean virtue, there is a philosophical link between truth and virtue in many contexts, as truthfulness is often considered a virtuous quality.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6: 10-19 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560) -- with Geneva Bible 1560 margin notes included.<br>
10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. <br>
<br>
11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the assaults of the devil.<br>
(The faithful have not only to strive against men and themselves,<br>
but against Satan the spiritual enemy , who is most dangerous: for he is<br>
over our heads that we can not reach him , but he always be resisted by God's grace.)<br>
12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, and against the worldly governors, the princes of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickednesses, which are in ye high places.<br>
<br>
13 For this cause take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to resist in the evil day, and having finished all things, stand fast.<br>
<br>
14 Stand therefore, and your loins girded about with veritie (truth), and having on the breast plate of righteousness,<br>
(the breast plate of righteousness, is the breast plate of<br>
innocence and Godly life)<br>
15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace.<br>
(the preparation of the Gospel of peace is so that ye may be ready to suffer all things<br>
for the Gospel.)<br>
16 Above all, take the shield of faith, wherewith ye may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked,<br>
<br>
17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<br>
(referring to Isaiah 59:17, the helmet of salvation is the salvation purchased by Jesus Christ.)<br>
18 And pray always with all manner prayer and supplication in the Spirit: and watch thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all Saints,<br>
(and watch thereunto is referencing Colossians 4:3.)<br>
(This area is also referencing 1st Thessalonians 5:8)<br>
19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly to publish the secret of the Gospel,<br>
(Verse 19 is also referencing 2nd Thessalonians 3:1.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Old English word, habergeon, refers to a type of medieval armour.<br>
Specifically, it is a short, sleeveless coat of chainmail or scale armour,<br>
designed to protect the torso.<br>
Unlike a full chainmail shirt, which could cover the arms and extend to the knees,<br>
the habergeon was lighter and provided more freedom of movement,<br>
often extending only to the waist or hips. It was commonly worn by soldiers and knights during the Middle Ages.<br>
(roughly from the 5th century to the late 15th century AD.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59:17 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
17 For he put on righteousness, as an habergeon,<br>
and an helmet of salvation upon his head,<br>
and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing,<br>
and was clad with zeal as a cloak.<br>
<br>
(an helmet of salvation is signifying that God hath means at hand to deliver his Church,<br>
and to punish their enemies.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 4: 3 & 4 -- Geneva Bible (GNV)<br>
3 Praying also for us, that God may open unto us the door of utterance, to speak ye mysteries of Christ: wherefore I am also in bonds,<br>
4 That I may utter it, as it becommeth me to speak.<br>
<br>
<br>
1st Thessalonians 5:8 -- Geneva Bible (GNV)<br>
But let us which are of the day, be sober, putting on the breast plate of faith and love, and of the hope of salvation for an helmet.<br>
<br>
<br>
2nd Thessalonians 3: 1 & 2 -- Geneva Bible (GNV)<br>
1 Furthermore, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free passage and be glorified, even as it is with you,<br>
2 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men: for all men have not faith.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Do all men have faith? No.<br>
For all men have not faith. To say that in today's English, one could say it like this.<br>
Not all men have faith. A few do, but most do not.<br>
May we be delivered and rescued from unreasonable and evil men.<br>
May the word of the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah have free passage and be glorified. Ah-Main.<br>

Let us pray.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, Master, ELL-Low-Heem,<br>
In my memories, my emotions, in my imaginations, and in my heart, mind and soul, there are many things going on, many things that I am thinking about and feeling right now, and I know that some of these things are bad. I don't know how to take these bad areas, and communicate them to you in this prayer.<br>
<br>
I don't know how to identify them, to call them out my name, and I don't know how to define them, I don't know how to take out a tape measure and measure their height, width and depth, and point to their exact location, and I don't know how to define where they start and stop, where they are located, and where they begin and end. All I know is that they are bad areas deep within my emotions, my feelings, my memories, in my imaginations, and in my heart, mind and soul. I do not even understand that they are bad, or how bad they really are, but I know that they are there.<br>
<br>
So, I ask that you Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, Master, ELL-Low-Heem, will enter into me, and find every one of these bad areas, and remove them from me, clean them out of me, rebuke and cast them all out of me, and heal these areas, and bring healing, remodelling, repair, resurrection and restoration to all of these areas, and create them brand new and replace them with healing and your perfection, making all of these bad areas, brand new and perfectly perfect. Clean me, heal me and strengthen me, and perfect me, and make me new and clean and perfect, in that beautiful, perfect way that only you can do.<br>
<br>
Do this now for me, for my entire family, my marriage, for all of the congregations and fellowships that I belong to now, and have been a part of in the past, and for all the believers around me, and for all of the congregations and fellowships that they are part of right now, and were a part of in the past, and do this for all of their marriages and families, grandparents, parents, children and grandchildren.<br>
<br>
Let us receive physical healing as well, especially in all of the areas where we are not aware of, that are in need of physical healing, and cast out of us all diseases, infirmities, weaknesses, and infections, heal any known or unknown diseases, cancers, tumours, damages, injuries, deformities and other physical imperfections, including all of those areas and locations that we are not aware of that are in need of this physical healing.<br>
<br>
Save us from our sins and the sins of our ancestors.  Let us receive and fill us up with your perfect love, your perfect peace, your mercy, grace, good favour and forgiveness, your Holy Spirit, your Roo-Awk Hawk-Oh-Desh, your seven-fold spirit, your presence and your glory. Help us love and forgive one another, and show us how to help and be a blessing to each other, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>
