Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

James 2: 15 & 16 -- KJV<br>
2:15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,<br>
2:16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?<br>
<br>
<br>
James 2: 15 & 16 -- NLT<br>
15 Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing,<br>
16 and you say, "Good-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well" -- but then you don't give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:19 -- KJV<br>
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Philippians 4:19 -- NLT<br>
And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 112:9 -- KJV<br>
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 112: 6-9 -- NLT<br>
...Those who are righteous will be long remembered.<br>
7<br>
They do not fear bad news;<br>
they confidently trust the Lord to care for them.<br>
8<br>
They are confident and fearless<br>
and can face their foes triumphantly.<br>
9<br>
They share freely and give generously to those in need.<br>
Their good deeds will be remembered forever.<br>
They will have influence and honour.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 9:6-10 -- KJV<br>
9:6 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.<br>
9:7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.<br>
9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:<br>
9:9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.<br>
9:10 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 9:6-10 -- NLT<br>
6 Remember this -- a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop. But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop.<br>
7 You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure. "For God loves a person who gives cheerfully."<br>
8 And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others.<br>
9 As the Scriptures say,<br>
"They share freely and give generously to the poor.<br>
Their good deeds will be remembered forever."<br>
(This is a quote from Psalms 112:9.)<br>
<br>
10 For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat.<br>
In the same way,<br>
(he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of righteousness in you.)<br>
he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 111:5 -- KJV<br>
(He hath given prey unto them that fear him:)<br>
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.<br>

He gives food to those who fear him;<br>
he always remembers his covenant.<br>
<br>

I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.<br>

For it was I, the Lord your God,<br>
who rescued you from the land of Egypt.<br>
Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it with good things.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 33: 18 & 19 -- KJV<br>

33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 33: 18 & 19 -- NLT<br>
18<br>
But the Lord watches over those who fear him,<br>
those who rely on his unfailing love.<br>
19<br>

and keeps them alive in times of famine.<br>

Luke 10: 19 & 20 -- KJV<br>

<br>
<br>
Luke 10: 19 & 20 -- NLT<br>

The next several sections contain Prayers for Release.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Prayers for Release have been a very special and important part of my family's daily routine.<br>
Since August of 2024, we have been reading the Morning and Evening prayers every single day.<br>
They have helped us keep our focus and our faith and our love for Him and for each other very blessed and strengthened.<br>
I would recommend that you read at least the morning and evening prayers every day, gathered around your entire family, reading them out loud to your family, and see if you also receive a healing and a blessing in yourself and in your family as well!<br>

Jesus is Salvation.<br>
To say that in Hebrew, one would say, Yaw-Who-Shaw is Yeh-Shoe-Uh.<br>
The Hebrew name for Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, will be spelled like this: Y a h s h u a<br>
in the prayers below. The word seen in the prayers below, as Yahshua<br>
should be pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw, which is the Hebrew way of saying, Jesus.<br>
<br>
The Father's name is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
The Lord's name is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
The Master's name is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
The Hebrew name for God is ELL-Low-Heem. It is spelled with a letter I in the TS2009. In the TS2009, it is spelled, E L o h i m.<br>
If you happen to read the Eth Cepher, the Eth Cepher will spell it with a letter Y instead of the letter I.<br>
<br>
The word, Ha'Satan, is pronounced, Ha-Saw-Tawn, which is the Hebrew word for satan.<br>
<br>
Technically, the Hebrew word, Ha, means, "The".<br>
So, Ha-Saw-Tawn, means The satan.<br>
We have seen this word, Ha, before, in previous Bible studies.<br>
Haw-Ah-Dome, is The Adam,<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw Ha-Muh-She-Uck, is Jesus The Christ.<br>
It still works if you remove the Ha.<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck, is Jesus Christ.<br>
Roo-Awk Haw-Coh-Desh, is, Spirit of The Holy, which is the Hebrew way of saying, Holy Spirit.<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Prayers for Release: MORNING PRAYER<br>
<br>
<br>
MORNING PRAYER<br>
<br>
Father, I declare that You are the One True Elohim, the Most High Elohim, the Elohim of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I ask You to forgive my sins and cleanse me of all unrighteousness, create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me. I plead the blood of Yahshua over my eyes and ears and over the eyes and ears of my family, so we can see and hear truth, and I ask You to shield us from all forms of mind control that can enter the eye gates and ear gates. I declare that we have access to the whole armour of Yahuah according to Ephesians 6; our loins are girt about with truth, and our feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. We have the breastplate of righteousness, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of Yahuah. As we commit our works unto You, our thoughts will be established according to Proverbs 16:3. Father, I ask You to apply the blood of Yahshua to any doors that I have open to the enemy that I am unaware of, and I ask You to reveal these doors to me so they can be closed forever.<br>
<br>
I take the authority that Yahshua gave me over all the power of the enemy according to Luke 10:19. I stand upon Your Word in Matthew 16:19 that I have been given the keys to the Kingdom and what I bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven, and what I loose on Earth will be loosed in Heaven. I take authority over the kingdom of darkness in every plain of existence that has access to me, and I bind the power of the enemy to affect me or my family, and I loose the power of the Kingdom of God to form impenetrable shields in every dimension -- above, below and all around, in the name of Yahshua.<br>
<br>
I stand upon the promise in Your Word that says that no weapon formed against me shall prosper, according to Isaiah 54:17. I stand upon the 91st Psalm that no evil shall befall me, neither shall any plague come nigh my dwelling. The 91st Psalm also promises that Your holy angels have been given charge over me and my family to keep us in all our ways. Father, I ask You to send extra angels for reinforcement during times of spiritual warfare, in Yahshua's name.<br>
<br>
Father, I ask You to forgive the sins of all of my ancestors (and the ancestors of my children and grandchildren), and I plead the blood of Yahshua over my DNA and the DNA of all of my descendants, which cleanses our bloodlines of all iniquity. I bind the power of any generational or familiar spirits to attach or influence us, and I loose the power of the Kingdom of Yahuah within us and around us as we keep Your commandments. I declare that our family is free to walk in the blessings of Deuteronomy 28.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 28: 1-14 -- TS2009<br>
1 "And it shall be, if you diligently obey the voice of Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem), to guard to do all His commands which I command you today, that Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim shall set you high above all nations of the earth.<br>
2 "And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, if you obey the voice of Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim:<br>
3 "Blessed are you in the city, and blessed are you in the field.<br>
4 "Blessed is the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground and the fruit of your livestock  --  the increase of your cattle and the offspring of your flocks.<br>
5 "Blessed is your basket and your kneading bowl.<br>
6 "Blessed are you when you come in, and blessed are you when you go out.<br>
7 "Yaw-Who-Wah causes your enemies who rise against you to be smitten before your face  --  they come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways.<br>
8 "Yaw-Who-Wah commands the blessing on you in your storehouses and in all to which you set your hand, and shall bless you in the land which Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim is giving you.<br>
9 "Yaw-Who-Wah does establish you as a set-apart people to Himself, as He has sworn to you, if you guard the commands of Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim and walk in His ways.<br>
10 "And all peoples of the earth shall see that the Name of Yaw-Who-Wah is called upon you, and they shall be afraid of you.<br>
11 "And Yaw-Who-Wah shall make you to have plenty of what is good, in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land of which Yaw-Who-Wah swore to your fathers to give you.<br>
12 "Yaw-Who-Wah opens to you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand. And you shall lend to many nations, but you do not borrow.<br>
13 "And Yaw-Who-Wah shall make you the head and not the tail. And you shall be only on top, and not be beneath, if you obey the commands of Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim, which I command you today, to guard and do.<br>
14 "And do not turn aside from any of the Words which I am commanding you today, right or left, to go after other mighty ones to serve them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I ask You to forgive the sins of all individuals being used by the enemy to combat our family (and ministry). I ask You to forgive the sins of all of their ancestors, and I plead the blood of Yahshua over their bloodlines all the way to the DNA level, breaking the power of iniquity. I ask You to break all of their occult power to the highest levels, making it impossible for them to be used by the kingdom of darkness to harm anyone. I ask You to save their souls, deliver and heal them. I plead the blood of Yahshua over every action and every word spoken against me and my family, nullifying the demonic power. I command any evil spirits sent on assignment against me and my family to return to the place they were sent from. I bind these spirits from harming those that sent them, but I pray that their defeat in their mission would serve as a testimony of Your greatness and the victory that Yahshua won for believers, in Yahshua's name. Father, I ask You to remove my DNA and the DNA of my family from any hair, blood or any other contact object in the hands of the enemy and break all conduits to our physical bodies, in Yahshua's name.<br>
<br>
Father, I ask You to forgive the sins that have allowed technology to be used as a weapon against Your creation. I ask You to place shields between me and my family and all broadcasts of the enemy through the airways, TVs, computers, phone lines, electric lines and satellites. I stand upon the promises in Your Word that You are our shield. I ask You to purify our air, water and food, in Yahshua's name. Father, I ask You to forgive the sins done on the roadways, railroad tracks, and waterways. I ask You to forgive the sins of any individuals or groups that have adopted the roadways, and I ask You to break any occult connections that would give power to the kingdom of darkness. Father, I ask You to provide divine protection during any modes of transportation. I ask You to surround our vehicles with Your holy angels to insure safe travel, in Yahshua's name. Father, lead me in paths of righteousness today and attune my ears to Your voice that I may follow You. I ask You to fill me with a hunger for your Word, that I may know You more. I give You all of my praise, my worship, the honour and the glory, in Yahshua's name.<br>

Prayers for Release: EVENING PRAYER<br>
<br>
<br>
EVENING PRAYER<br>
<br>
Father, I declare that You are the Elohim of our evenings as well as our days. I stand upon Psalm 91:5, 6 -- Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night or the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. I plead the blood of Yahshua over my family. I come into agreement with the promises in Your Word that my family is blessed physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I ask You to put impenetrable shields around our property, with armies of Your holy angels standing guard. I ask You to forgive the sins that have been done in the surrounding area, and I command the kingdom of darkness to clear our airways, grounds, and underneath, in Yahshua's name. Father, I bind any demons from entering our property. I ask You to forgive the sins that have enabled astral travel and I ask You to block that activity. I ask You to place hedges of protection around our family that humans cannot penetrate, either physically or through astral projection. I loose the power of the Kingdom of Yahuah to break the power of satanic surveillance. Father, I ask You to send Your holy angels to roadblock any attacks from the enemy. Father, because of Your faithfulness, we can go to sleep with full assurance that You are watching over us through the night. We ask all of these things in the Mighty Name of Yahshua.<br>

<br>
PRAYER FOR RELEASE FROM GENERATIONAL CURSES<br>
<br>
Father, I ask You to forgive all of the sins of our ancestors. I ask You to cover our bloodlines all the way to the DNA level with the blood of Yahshua, and I ask You to send the blood of Yahshua over the spiritual lines connecting us to those that we share DNA with, blocking any familiar spirits coming to us. We declare that Yahshua paid the price for us to be free of every generational curse, and we take our authority over all the power of the enemy according to Luke 10:19 and stand upon Matthew 16:19 that what we bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven and what we loose on Earth will be loosed in Heaven. We bind every familiar spirit and generational spirit that has attached to our family because of the iniquity on our bloodlines, and we command them to leave us, in Yahshua's name. We loose the power of the Kingdom of Yahuah within us and around us, and we ask for restoration of all that Ha'Satan (Ha-Saw-Tawn -- Satan) has stolen through these generational doorways (including our health, resources, joy and peace), in Yahshua's name.<br>

<br>
<br>
Prayer Compiled by Isaiah 54 Ministries<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 54 Ministries is a ministry of reconciliation.  Heeding the call of 2 Corinthians 5: 18 & 19, we work towards reconciliation between man and God, and between man and his fellow man through the Christian disciplines of Worship, Inner Healing and Spiritual Warfare.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 54 Ministries has compiled this article to help Christians become free from the curses brought upon themselves and their bloodline because of involvement with &#070;ree&#109;&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry and other secret organisations.<br>
<br>
The first step towards freedom is to understand the reasons that curses transfer through a family line.<br>
<br>
Iniquity & Idolatry bring generational curses. &#070;ree&#109;&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry's practices and doctrines are iniquities laced with idolatry. We believe, to facilitate healing more completely, the believer MUST, at the very least, understand this foundational concept.<br>
<br>
We have found that these prayers work best if done in the presence of experienced inner healing/deliverance counsellors.<br>
<br>
If you are being led to pursue deliverance from generational curses, or any other need for inner healing, please contact our ministry.<br>

If you were once a M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110; or are a descendant of a M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;, we recommend that you pray through the following prayer from your heart. Don't be like the M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;s who are given their obligations and oaths one line at a time and without prior knowledge of the requirements. Please read it through first so you know what is involved. It is best to then pray this aloud with a Christian witness or counsellor present who understands &#070;ree&#109;&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry and the dangers of secret societies. We suggest a brief pause following each paragraph to allow the Holy Spirit to show any additional issues that may require attention.<br>

"Father God. Creator of heaven and earth, I come to you in the name of Jesus Christ your Son. I come as a sinner seeking forgiveness and cleansing from all sins committed against you, and others made in your image.

Holy Spirit, I ask that you show me anything else which I need to do or to pray so that I and my family may be totally free from the consequences of the sins of M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry, Witchcraft, Mormonism and Paganism.<br>
<br>
(Pause, whilst listening to God, and pray as the Holy Spirit leads you.)<br>
<br>
Now dear Father God. I ask humbly for the blood of Jesus Christ, your Son, to cleanse me from all these sins I have confessed and renounced, to cleanse my spirit, my soul, my mind, my emotions and every part of my body which has been affected by these sins. In Jesus' name.<br>
<br>
I renounce every evil spirit associated with M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;ry, Witchcraft and all other sins. I command in The name of Jesus Christ for Satan and every evil spirit to be bound and to leave me now, touching or harming no-one, and go to the place appointed for you by the Lord Jesus, never to return to me or my family. I call on the name of the Lord Jesus to be delivered of these spirits, in accordance with the many promises of the Bible. I ask to be delivered of every spirit of sickness. Infirmity, curse, affliction, addiction, disease or allergy associated with these sins I have confessed and renounced. I surrender to God's Holy Spirit and to no other spirit all the places in my life where these sins have been. I ask you, Lord, to baptise me in your Holy Spirit now according to the promises in your Word. I take to myself the whole armour of God in accordance with Ephesians Chapter Six and rejoice in its protection as Jesus surrounds me and fills me with His Holy Spirit. I enthrone you, Lord Jesus, in my heart, for you are my Lord and my Saviour, the source of eternal life. Thank you, Father God, for your mercy, your forgiveness and your love, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.<br>
<br>
</p><hr><p>
<br>
NOTE:<br>
<br>
Christians should pray for M&#097;&#115;&#111;&#110;s without judging them. Bring their sins to God in an attitude of love, petitioning the Father for His mercy, binding in the name of Jesus Christ the spirits of deception, antichrist, witchcraft and death. Most men have no perception of the spiritual deception they have entered.<br>
<br>
Please remember that 'We do not wrestle against flesh and blood (your loved ones) but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places,' (Ephesians 6:12)<br>
<br>
This is a spiritual battle and should be treated accordingly.<br>

PRAYER FOR RELEASE FROM SOUL TIES<br>

<br>
<br>
PRAYER FOR RELEASE FROM SOUL TIES<br>
<br>
Father, I repent for every ungodly soul tie that I have made through sexual union. I apply the blood of Yahshua to the soul tie that I made with ____________. I ask You to sever the cord connecting me to this person with the Sword of the Spirit. I bind any demonic attachments that came to me, and I command them to leave me, in Yahshua's name. I loose the power of the Kingdom of Yahuah within me and around me to restore what was damaged by this soul tie. I ask You to seal the severed cord with the blood of Yahshua, so it can never be connected again, and I ask You to remove any foreign DNA from my body, in Yahshua's name. Father, I ask You to deliver every person from any spirits that were transferred to them from me, in Yahshua's name.<br>

<br>
<br>
PRAYER FOR VICTIMS OF TRAUMA AND FRAGMENTATION<br>
<br>
Father, I submit myself to You, spirit, soul and body, and I am so grateful for the price that Yahshua paid to make me whole. I ask You to forgive the sins of my abusers, and I ask You to sever all soul ties with them. I command any spirits that passed through the soul ties to leave me, in the name of Yahshua, and I ask You to seal those severed cords with the blood of Yahshua. As an act of my will, I choose to forgive every individual that has harmed me, in Yahshua's name. I take authority over my mind, and I bind gatekeepers and watchers and break their power over me, in the name of Yahshua. I loose the power of the Kingdom of Yahuah within me and around me, to overtake and override every plot and scheme of the enemy to hold me captive, in Yahshua's name. Father, I ask You to impart to me the anointing that destroys every yoke of bondage. I thank You for the promise of a sound mind in 2 Timothy 1:7.<br>
<br>
Father, I ask You to forgive the sins done to me that defiled Your Name, Your Word, and Your House, and I ask You to restore the truth of who You are to every part of my being. Father, I ask You to judge every demonic force that has been a part of my captivity since I was a child and deliver me. I plead the blood of Yahshua over every ritual performed and every oath, vow, contract and covenant made connecting me to the kingdom of darkness, and I ask You to set me free and bring me under the protection of Your Kingdom. Father, when I was a child I was taken against my will, but I now have authority through Yahshua over my tormentors, and I command them to let me go, in Yahshua's name. According to Psalm 142:7, I pray: Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name.<br>
<br>
Father, I ask You to make every doorway to blocked memories one-way doors, and I plead the blood of Yahshua into every area of my mind. I ask You to override any mind control programming that has been used as a weapon against me, as I stand upon Your Word in Isaiah 54:17 that no weapon formed against me shall prosper. I ask You to show me anything that I need to see to be free, but I ask that the overwhelming emotions would be buffered, to allow me to come to grips with the truth without further trauma. I place my healing in Your hands, and I place my trust in You.<br>
<br>
I bind any demons that are a part of my programming, and I loose the Spirit of Truth to counter and eradicate from my mind spirits of doubt and deception, in Yahshua's name. I ask forgiveness for the sins that caused my mind to fragment, and I command the past to let me go. Because You fill all space and time, I ask You to pour anointing oil on every fragment of my mind at the time that the splitting occurred. I claim the manifested healing and deliverance at this present time, and I declare that I am not a child any more; I am free to mature to my present age with restored peace and joy. I claim restoration of the years that Ha'Satan has stolen from me. I claim back my health, my resources, and my future, in Yahshua's name.<br>
<br>
I declare that I am a child of the King of the Universe, and I choose to follow the One True Elohim and declare that I have been set free from the kingdom of darkness, in Yahshua's name. I renounce all connections to Satanism, witchcraft, Druidism, and all other factions of the occult. Teach me Your ways so I can walk circumspectly before You each day, in Yahshua's name. Father, I ask You to forgive every sin done by every fragment of my being, including involvement in the occult. I renounce these powers and bind Ha'Satan's ability to use me in any way. I loose the sanctifying power of the blood of Yahshua to cover any gifts that You have given me, so I can flow in a pure stream of the Ruach Ha'Kodesh. Father, I repent for any forbidden activities, such as astral projection, and I take authority over my vessel and forbid any demons, humans, or mind control program to cause me to leave my body.I ask You to forgive the sins of every individual that I have been connected to in the occult, and I ask You to sever all connections so that I can never be accessed again, in Yahshua's name. I ask You to forgive the sins that allowed fragment exchanges between me and any other person, and I bind any demons connected to these exchanges. I ask You to block any humans with pernicious intent from contacting me. I ask You to hide any brain wave identification and block all satanic surveillance, in Yahshua's name. Father, place hedges of protection around me and surround me with armies of Your holy angels to block all activity directed against me in the spiritual or physical realms, in Yahshua's name. I take authority over and command every part of my being to stay within my physical body. Father, I place my sleep state in Your hands and trust You to keep me safe. Father, I ask You to reveal any additional information that is essential for my healing, in Yahshua's name.<br>

Here are the lyrics to another song by Devoted To Yah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Devoted To Yah<br>
is a band and Bible study group<br>
created by Darionel Serrano.<br>
The Devoted To Yah YouTube channel was first created on 30 September 2011.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the words to Devoted To Yah's<br>
2016 song, In the middle of the storm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The "Raw Recording" was uploaded to YouTube on 15 September 2016.<br>
The Raw Recording is a good acoustical recording,<br>
but it has lower sound quality.<br>
This is the one where he is wearing a blue shirt.<br>
<br>
<br>
A regular studio album version was uploaded to YouTube<br>
on 19 July 2017.<br>
It has some vocal Auto-Tune processing, and piano accompaniment.<br>
It fades out early. Not all of the ending lyrics are included.<br>
<br>
<br>
A second acoustical recording was uploaded onto YouTube on<br>
19 October 2018.<br>
The sound quality is much better than the Raw Recording.<br>
This is the one where he is wearing a red shirt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2016 song,<br>
In the middle of the storm, by Devoted To Yah.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm running<br>
I'm chasing<br>
for all the things that please Your heart<br>
but I feel like<br>
I'm being pushed back<br>
while many things seem to fall apart<br>
I am waiting for my breakthrough and<br>
I won't let go 'til you bless my soul<br>
<br>
and I just want to say<br>
<br>
In the middle of the storm, I run to You<br>                        
I reminisce on my before<br>
and how You brought me through<br>
I worship You for who You are<br>
not only what You do<br>
In the middle of the storm I will worship You<br>
Oooo, You<br>
Oooo<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I hear the voices<br>
of many mockers<br>
telling me it's not worth the fight<br>
but I keep watching<br>
I keep praying<br>
while many slumber through the night<br>
I am waiting for the sunrise<br>
to wash away the darkness of this world<br>
<br>
and I just want to say<br>
<br>
In the middle of the storm,<br>
I run to You<br>           
I reminisce on my before<br>
and how You brought me through<br>
I worship You for who You are<br>
not only what You do<br>
In the middle of the storm, I will worship You<br>
Oooo, You<br>
Oooo<br>
<br>
<br>
I know my future is secured in Your hands even though<br>
The fog of life is trying to blind me<br>
but I know The house I'm building is not standing on sand, so I'll go<br>
From faith to faith, glory to glory<br>
<br>
<br>
It's in the middle of the storm,<br>
I run to You<br>         
I reminisce on my before<br>
and how You brought me through<br>
I worship You for who You are<br>
not only what You do<br>
In the middle of the storm, I will worship You<br>
<br>
<br>
It's in the middle of the storm,<br>
I run to You<br>      
I reminisce on my before<br>
and how You brought me through<br>
I worship You for who You are<br>
not only what You do<br>
In the middle of the storm I will worship You<br>
Oooo, You<br>
Oooo, and I will worship<br>
<br>
<br>
I worship on the mountain top;<br>
and I will worship in the valley low<br>
and I will worship when life's unfair<br>
and I will worship when I'm in despair<br>
and I will worship through the hurt and pain<br>
and I will worship through the hurricane<br>
and I will worship in the day and night<br>
and I will worship 'til we reunite<br>
Even if they hate me and really want to kill me<br>
or put me in the fire;<br>
I know that You will save me but<br>
Even if You don't I still won't bow<br>
I won't back down or put my head to the ground<br>
HalleluYah I give you all the praise<br>
For the rest of my days I will bless Your only Name<br>
HalleluYah I give you all the praise<br>
For the rest of my days I will bless Your only Name<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yeah, I will bless your only name<br>

Commentary:<br>
<br>
A sin of omission is a sin that is the result of not doing something ELL-Low-Heem's Torah teaches that we should do.<br>
<br>
A sin of omission involves not doing what is right or failing to do as instructed.<br>
Refusing to share Christ with others, neglecting to care for those in need, and avoiding prayer are all examples of sins of omission.<br>
<br>
A sin of omission is when we neglect to do what we know is right.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let us now pray.<br>
Heavenly Father, Yaw-Who-Wah, and your only-begotten Son, Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck,<br>
we call upon your name, the name above all names. We believe that Yaw-Who-Shaw is our Master.<br>
<br>
When we pray for ourselves, or when we pray for somebody else, or when we pray for our friends<br>

they are not to go to our other family members<br>
they are not to go to our friends or to other people in our life<br>

The King James Version (KJV) was first released in the year, 1611.<br>
<br>
The Geneva Bible was released 51 years before the King James Version (KJV) Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, we will read once again, an important and familiar bit of Scripture<br>
from Ephesians Chapter 6.<br>
<br>
But, this time, we will enjoy it in the Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560).<br>
<br>
<br>
Because the Geneva Bible has very old English spellings,<br>
we will adjust the English spellings so that this translation<br>
will be easy to read using the spelling of today's English.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6: 10-19 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.<br>
11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the assaults of the devil. <br>
12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, and against the worldly governors, the princes of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickednesses, which are in ye high places.<br>
13 For this cause take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to resist in the evil day, and having finished all things, stand fast.<br>
14 Stand therefore, and your loins girded about with veritie, and having on the breast plate of righteousness,<br>
15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace.<br>
16 Above all, take the shield of faith, wherewith ye may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked,<br>
17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<br>
18 And pray always with all manner prayer and supplication in the Spirit: and watch thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all Saints,<br>
19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly to publish the secret of the Gospel,<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's read it again with the Geneva Bible 1560 margin notes included.<br>
These are the 1560 margin notes, not the 1599 notes.<br>
The Geneva Bible 1560 margin notes, very difficult to find and read, are included here in round brackets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Old English word veritie (or veritas in Latin) means truth in modern English.<br>
Whilst it does not directly mean virtue, there is a philosophical link between truth and virtue in many contexts, as truthfulness is often considered a virtuous quality.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6: 10-19 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560) -- with Geneva Bible 1560 margin notes included.<br>
10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. <br>
<br>
11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the assaults of the devil.<br>
(The faithful have not only to strive against men and themselves,<br>
but against Satan the spiritual enemy , who is most dangerous: for he is<br>
over our heads that we can not reach him , but he always be resisted by God's grace.)<br>
12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, and against the worldly governors, the princes of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickednesses, which are in ye high places.<br>
<br>
13 For this cause take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to resist in the evil day, and having finished all things, stand fast.<br>
<br>
14 Stand therefore, and your loins girded about with veritie (truth), and having on the breast plate of righteousness,<br>
(the breast plate of righteousness, is the breast plate of<br>
innocence and Godly life)<br>
15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace.<br>
(the preparation of the Gospel of peace is so that ye may be ready to suffer all things<br>
for the Gospel.)<br>
16 Above all, take the shield of faith, wherewith ye may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked,<br>
<br>
17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<br>
(referring to Isaiah 59:17, the helmet of salvation is the salvation purchased by Jesus Christ.)<br>
18 And pray always with all manner prayer and supplication in the Spirit: and watch thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all Saints,<br>
(and watch thereunto is referencing Colossians 4:3.)<br>
(This area is also referencing 1st Thessalonians 5:8)<br>
19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly to publish the secret of the Gospel,<br>
(Verse 19 is also referencing 2nd Thessalonians 3:1.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Old English word, habergeon, refers to a type of medieval armour.<br>
Specifically, it is a short, sleeveless coat of chainmail or scale armour,<br>
designed to protect the torso.<br>
Unlike a full chainmail shirt, which could cover the arms and extend to the knees,<br>
the habergeon was lighter and provided more freedom of movement,<br>
often extending only to the waist or hips. It was commonly worn by soldiers and knights during the Middle Ages.<br>
(roughly from the 5th century to the late 15th century AD.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59:17 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
17 For he put on righteousness, as an habergeon,<br>
and an helmet of salvation upon his head,<br>
and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing,<br>
and was clad with zeal as a cloak.<br>
<br>
(an helmet of salvation is signifying that God hath means at hand to deliver his Church,<br>
and to punish their enemies.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 4: 3 & 4 -- Geneva Bible (GNV)<br>
3 Praying also for us, that God may open unto us the door of utterance, to speak ye mysteries of Christ: wherefore I am also in bonds,<br>
4 That I may utter it, as it becommeth me to speak.<br>
<br>
<br>
1st Thessalonians 5:8 -- Geneva Bible (GNV)<br>
But let us which are of the day, be sober, putting on the breast plate of faith and love, and of the hope of salvation for an helmet.<br>
<br>
<br>
2nd Thessalonians 3: 1 & 2 -- Geneva Bible (GNV)<br>
1 Furthermore, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free passage and be glorified, even as it is with you,<br>
2 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men: for all men have not faith.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Do all men have faith? No.<br>
For all men have not faith. To say that in today's English, one could say it like this.<br>
Not all men have faith. A few do, but most do not.<br>
May we be delivered and rescued from unreasonable and evil men.<br>
May the word of the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah have free passage and be glorified. Ah-Main.<br>

Let us pray.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, Master, ELL-Low-Heem,<br>
In my memories, my emotions, in my imaginations, and in my heart, mind and soul, there are many things going on, many things that I am thinking about and feeling right now, and I know that some of these things are bad. I don't know how to take these bad areas, and communicate them to you in this prayer.<br>
<br>
I don't know how to identify them, to call them out my name, and I don't know how to define them, I don't know how to take out a tape measure and measure their height, width and depth, and point to their exact location, and I don't know how to define where they start and stop, where they are located, and where they begin and end. All I know is that they are bad areas deep within my emotions, my feelings, my memories, in my imaginations, and in my heart, mind and soul. I do not even understand that they are bad, or how bad they really are, but I know that they are there.<br>
<br>
So, I ask that you Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, Master, ELL-Low-Heem, will enter into me, and find every one of these bad areas, and remove them from me, clean them out of me, rebuke and cast them all out of me, and heal these areas, and bring healing, remodelling, repair, resurrection and restoration to all of these areas, and create them brand new and replace them with healing and your perfection, making all of these bad areas, brand new and perfectly perfect. Clean me, heal me and strengthen me, and perfect me, and make me new and clean and perfect, in that beautiful, perfect way that only you can do.<br>
<br>
Do this now for me, for my entire family, my marriage, for all of the congregations and fellowships that I belong to now, and have been a part of in the past, and for all the believers around me, and for all of the congregations and fellowships that they are part of right now, and were a part of in the past, and do this for all of their marriages and families, grandparents, parents, children and grandchildren.<br>
<br>
Let us receive physical healing as well, especially in all of the areas where we are not aware of, that are in need of physical healing, and cast out of us all diseases, infirmities, weaknesses, and infections, heal any known or unknown diseases, cancers, tumours, damages, injuries, deformities and other physical imperfections, including all of those areas and locations that we are not aware of that are in need of this physical healing.<br>
<br>
Save us from our sins and the sins of our ancestors.  Let us receive and fill us up with your perfect love, your perfect peace, your mercy, grace, good favour and forgiveness, your Holy Spirit, your Roo-Awk Hawk-Oh-Desh, your seven-fold spirit, your presence and your glory. Help us love and forgive one another, and show us how to help and be a blessing to each other, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>

The World Health Organisation (WHO) is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for global public health.<br>
It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and has six regional offices and 150 field offices worldwide.<br>
Only sovereign states can participate, and it is the largest intergovernmental health organisation at the international level.<br>
<br>
Does the Bible have anything to say about the World Health Organisation (WHO)?<br>

Revelation 13: 3 & 4 -- KJV<br>
13:3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.<br>
13:4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 13: 3 & 4 -- NLT<br>
3 I saw that one of the heads of the beast seemed wounded beyond recovery -- but the fatal wound was healed! The whole world marvelled at this miracle and gave allegiance to the beast.<br>
4 They worshipped the dragon for giving the beast such power, and they also worshipped the beast. "Who is as great as the beast?" they exclaimed. "Who is able to fight against him?"<br>

What was that wound in verse 3?<br>
What was the Greek word there that became the English word, wound?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Greek word for wound, is pronounced, Play-Gay.<br>

Commentary:<br>
When you look at the aerial satellite images of Washignton, District of Columbia (Washington DC),<br>
you can draw a Satanic pentagram between each of the main buildings of the United States government.<br>
If you look closely at the building known as the White House,<br>
the streets surrounding the white house make the shape of an owl<br>
and the owl, which is an unclean animal that prefers to live in darkness,<br>
the heart of the owl is the White House,<br>
and the White House sits in the location of the heart of the owl,<br>
and what sound does an owl make? Who! Who!<br>
WHO is like unto the beast, and the beast gets its power from the dragon.<br>

Let's read the lyrics to two songs that my family enjoyed playing many times throughout the summer and autumn of 2024.<br>
The first one is a 2004 song by Newsboys.<br>
<br>
Newsboys are a Christian rock band founded in 1985 in Mooloolaba, Queensland, Australia.<br>
The current lead singer, Michael Tait, is also one third of Christian rock group, DC Talk.<br>
As of December of 2024,<br>
The discography of the Australian Christian rock band, Newsboys,<br>
consists of 20 studio albums, 2 remix albums,<br>
17 compilations, 2 live albums, 1 demo,<br>
102 singles, 10 extended plays,<br>
and an uncertain number of, perhaps, more than<br>
30 music videos, as well as a number of some official live recordings.<br>
<br>
They also have appeared in some scenes in the motion picture film series,<br>
God's Not Dead.<br>
As of December of 2024, there were a total of five of these films released:<br>
God's Not Dead -- came out in 2014,<br>
God's Not Dead 2 -- came out in 2016,<br>
God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness -- was released in 2018,<br>
God's Not Dead: We the People -- was released in 2021,<br>
and God's Not Dead: In God We Trust -- came out in 2024.<br>
<br>
The 2013 Evangelical Christian book by<br>
Rice Broocks<br>
titled, God's Not Dead: Evidence for God in an Age of Uncertainty,<br>
serves as the inspiration for the God's Not Dead films.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take a moment to enjoy the words to one of the songs by Newsboys.<br>
The song is titled, Presence, My Heart's Desire.<br>
The song, "Presence (My Heart's Desire)"<br>
is from their album, Devotion.<br>
Devotion is the eleventh studio album by<br>
Christian pop rock band, Newsboys,<br>
released in November 2004.<br>
It is a follow up album to the band's<br>
first worship-oriented project, Adoration.<br>
<br>
This song was very special to my family when it was first released in 2004,<br>
and became a popular song in our home again through-out the year of 2024.<br>
<br>
<br>
The song, "Presence (My Heart's Desire)" was released as a single<br>
just a couple of months before the album was released.<br>
There is an Adult Contemporary Mix, which is the album version.<br>
There is also a Rock Version, which has a stronger rock music sound,<br>
intended for radio play on the Christian Rock radio networks.<br>
One popular Christian Rock radio network in the United States at that time was, Air 1.<br>
<br>
These two versions are the same length, and were released on 3 September 2004,<br>
onto a promotional CD single, released only to DJs and radio stations.<br>
The Promo CD single identified the tracks only as,<br>
(Radio Edit 1) and (Radio Mix 2).<br>
<br>
There is also an instrumental mix, which still has the original background vocals,<br>
and all of the original mix, with only the lead vocals not included.<br>
This instrumental version, with the background vocals, but not the lead vocal,<br>
was released in 2009, under the title,<br>
Premiere Performance Plus - Presence (My Heart's Desire), as made popular by Newsboys.<br>
<br>
It is the original recording by the original artists,<br>
with only the lead vocal being removed from the original mix.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2004 song, Presence (My Heart's Desire), by Newsboys.<br>
<br>
<br>
I lift<br>
up my voice<br>
To The King,<br>
The King of glory<br>

This next song gets its inspiration and content from the first five verses of the book of Joel, Chapter 2.<br>
Joel, Chapter 2, describes how Locusts Invade like an Army,<br>

A Call to Repentance,<br>
The Lord's Promise of Restoration, and<br>
The Lord's Promise of His Spirit.<br>

As the dawn is spread over the mountains<br>

Nor will there be again<br>

A scythe (pronounced, S-eye-th) is a farming tool that has a long curved blade attached to a long wooden handle, and is used to cut grain or long grass.<br>
It's for cutting tall crops or grass by hand with a sweeping action.<br>
<br>
The Saturnian religion, often associated with ancient Saturnian worship, especially in Roman and pre-Roman traditions, does not have a single unified symbol that is universally recognised as its official emblem. However, there are several symbols and motifs connected to the worship of Saturn that have been used over time.<br>
The Saturnian religion, particularly in its ancient Roman form, may use symbols like the scythe, Saturn's statue, or the black cube (in modern interpretations), each emphasising different aspects of Saturn's influence -- agriculture, time, limitation, and structure. However, as with many ancient religious systems, the exact symbols can vary based on the context and era.<br>
The symbol of the planet Saturn itself, a circle with a cross beneath it, is also used to represent the god Saturn.<br>
<br>
Is the Saturn religion mentioned in the Bible?<br>
<br>
<br>
Amos 5:26 -- NLT -- Hebrew Version<br>
No, you served your pagan gods -- Sakkuth your king god and Kaiwan your star god -- the images you made for yourselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Amos 5:26 & 27 -- NLT -- Greek Version<br>
No, you carried your pagan gods -- the shrine of Molech, the star of your god Rephan, and the images you made for yourselves. <br>
So I will send you into exile, to a land east of Damascus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Amos 5:26 -- TS2009<br>
but you took up Sikkuth your sovereign and Kiyyun, your idols, your astral mighty ones, which you made for yourselves!<br>
<br>
Amos 5:26 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
(But you have born that idol which you esteemed as your King and carried about,<br>
as you did Chiun, in the which images you thought there was a certain divinity.)<br>
But you have born Siccuth your King, and Chiun your images, and the star of your gods, which ye made to your selves.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 7:43 -- NLT<br>
No, you carried your pagan gods --<br>
the shrine of Molech,<br>
the star of your god Rephan,<br>
and the images you made to worship them.<br>
So I will send you into exile<br>
as far away as Babylon.'<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 7:43 -- TS2009<br>
'And you took up the tent of Molekk, and the star of your mighty one Kiyyun, images which you made to bow before them. Therefore I shall remove you beyond Babel.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: The margin note in the Geneva Bible seems to suggest that the Moloch worshippers did something to their shoulders.<br>
Perhaps it was some kind of marking or cutting on their shoulders, or maybe it was some kind of tattoo?<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 7: 43 & 44 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
(And ye carved it upon your shoulders,)<br>
And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures, which ye made to worship them: therefore I will carry you away beyond Babylon.<br>
Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness, in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.<br>
(They ought to have been content with this covenant only and not to have gone after their lewd fantasies.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Amos 5:26 -- KJV<br>
But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Chiun is an an image, pillar or statue of the Assyrian-Babylonian god of the planet Saturn and used to symbolise Israelite apostasy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 7:43 -- KJV<br>
Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Moloch is a word that means, king. Moloch is a god worshipped by several Semitic peoples.<br>
Moloch, the god of the Ammonites, Moloch is the name of the idol god of the Ammonites,<br>
to which human victims, particularly young children were offered in sacrifice.<br>
Its image was a hollow brasen figure, with the head of an ox, and outstretched human arms.<br>
It was heated red hot by a fire from within, and the little ones placed in its arms to be slowly burned.<br>
To prevent the parents from hearing the dying cries, the sacrificing priests would beat drums.<br>
<br>
Babylon is, allegorically, of Rome as the most corrupt seat of idolatry and the enemy of Christianity.<br>

Chiun, in Amos 5:26 and the fake god, Remphan, in Acts 7:43 are both one and the same. It is the god Remphan found in both of these verses.<br>
Remphan is mentioned in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.<br>
<br>
Remphan is known as the god, Saturn.<br>
Remphan is the same god mentioned in Amos 5:26.<br>
Rompha, or Rephan, are some of the names of Seb, the Egyptian Saturn.<br>
Rephan is the name of an idol, Seb, worshipped secretly by the Israelites in the wilderness.<br>
It is part of the satanic trinity, of Isis, Horus, Seb, a father-mother-child trinity, identified today as IHS.<br>
When you see IHS, that is what it means!<br>
IHS are the letters of three Egyptian gods.<br>
It may also be pronounced as Isis, Horus, Set.<br>
Satanic buildings will have IHS posted all about, inside and outside.<br>
<br>
Saturnalia is an ancient Roman festival and holiday in honour of the god Saturn,<br>
held on 17 December in the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities until 19 December.<br>
By the 1st century BC, the celebration had been extended until 23 December, for a total of seven days of festivities.<br>
Saturn was a god in ancient Roman religion, and a character in Roman mythology.<br>
Saturn was especially celebrated during the festival of Saturnalia each December, perhaps the most famous of the Roman festivals, a time of feasting, role reversals, free speech, gift-giving and revelry.<br>
Saturnalia is a festival of light leading to the winter solstice, with the abundant presence of candles.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Saturnalia was a key religious festival dedicated to the god Saturn in ancient Rome, celebrated annually from 17 to 23 December. It was marked by a reversal of social norms, where slaves and masters would temporarily switch roles, and feasts, games, and public revelry were common. During Saturnalia, traditional hierarchies were relaxed, and everyone participated in merrymaking. People exchanged gifts, particularly candles and small figurines, symbolising the light of Saturn and good fortune. The festival was a time of conviviality, with abundant food and drink, music, dancing, and gambling, which was usually frowned upon in more solemn contexts.<br>
<br>
The rituals of Saturn worship were also centred on agricultural themes, as Saturn was originally the god of sowing and agriculture. Offerings, including sacrifices, were made to ensure prosperity and a good harvest. Temples dedicated to Saturn, such as the Temple of Saturn in the Roman Forum, played a central role in the celebrations. The religious significance of Saturnalia was linked to themes of renewal, freedom, and the restoration of order, celebrating both the cosmic and societal cycles.<br>
<br>
The symbol commonly associated with the Saturn religion is the black cube, which represents both the planet Saturn and its metaphysical qualities. The cube is often seen as a symbol of structure, restriction, and the material world, reflecting Saturn's associations with time, discipline, and limitations.<br>
<br>
In some interpretations, the black cube is also linked to the Kaaba in Mecca, drawing parallels between the cube's spiritual significance in the Saturnian context and its role as a focal point for devotion in Islamic traditions.<br>
<br>
A hexagon, or a six-sided star, has been used symbolically in various contexts related to the Saturn religion, particularly in the form of a Star of David-like symbol, which often carries associations with cosmic harmony and sacred geometry. The six-pointed star, consisting of two interlocking triangles, can be seen as representing the union of opposites or the balance of material and spiritual forces. Whilst this specific symbol may not be universally linked to the Saturn religion, it is sometimes associated with Saturn's geometric and cosmic aspects, emphasising the balance and duality inherent in Saturnian themes such as time, order, and structure.<br>
<br>
In some esoteric traditions, the hexagon, especially in the context of Saturn, is linked to the planet's hexagonal storm at its north pole, representing a powerful natural and cosmic form. The six-sided structure can thus be viewed as a metaphor for the organised, yet mysterious, forces associated with Saturn, aligning with ideas of discipline, structure, and universal law.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, when you see a place that has a six-pointed star, consisting of two interlocking triangles, or the worship of a large cube, or the letters IHS,<br>
they can all be traced back to star of Remphan, which traces back to Babylon, which traces back to Nimrod and his Tower of Babylon,<br>
which traces back to the worship of the fallen watchers that made the giants before the flood,<br>
which traces back to the giving of Evil Knowledge, which traces back to satan.<br>
<br>
Do your research, trace it all back, and the star, the cube and IHS all point back to satan.<br>

We also read all of Psalms 1 when we were in Christian Essays 4.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 1 -- all of Psalms 1, all 6 verses (KJV)<br>
1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly (that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked), nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.<br>
2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.<br>
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither (his leaf also shall not fade); and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.<br>
4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.<br>
5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgement, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br>
6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When we were half of the way into Christian Essays 3, I mentioned to you this Commentary.<br>
When you read and study the Bible, the Torah, day and night, Psalms 1:3 promises that your leaf shall not wither;<br>
What would happen to the leaf of a tree if it is far away from the rivers of water?<br>
What would happen to you, and how would you feel if you stopped drinking water?<br>
Your Bible is your true source of living water and the Bread of Eternal Life!<br>
With a little bit of Commentary inserted here, let's read again Psalms 1: 2 & 3 -- The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009)<br>
2 But his delight is in (studying the Bible, His Law) the Torah of the Lord (Yaw-Who-Wah), And he meditates in (the Bible, His Law) His Torah day and night.<br>
3 For (when you do that, you shall be) he shall be as a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That yields its fruit in its season (not your season, in His season, not when you say when, it's when He says when), And whose leaf does not wither, And whatever he does prospers.<br>

Psalms 119:18 (KJV)<br>
Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.<br>

Psalms 119:18 -- NLT<br>
Open my eyes to see<br>
the wonderful truths in your instructions.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Those of the Judaism religion claim to follow Torah, but their definition of Torah is false.<br>
They have added many books that are not in the Bible, and have rejected many chapters and books that are in the Bible.<br>
Their rejection of the Bible includes all of the New Testament, and certain areas in Isaiah and Daniel.<br>

One of their 11 albums is titled, HaDerech L'Tzion. It was released in the year of 2013.<br>
HaDerech L'Tzion means, The Road to Zion.<br>
HaDerech L'Tzion, like much of their work, blends Jewish tradition with contemporary influences,<br>
exploring both personal and communal aspects of Jewish life.<br>
The songs on HaDerech L'Tzion are known for their deep spiritual and emotional resonance,<br>
combining traditional melodies with new, original compositions<br>
that speak to the hearts of listeners in a variety of cultural and spiritual contexts.<br>
<br>
One of the eight Messianic Worship Songs on this album is, Open My Eyes.<br>
<br>
Here are some Hebrew words that are sang in this song, Open My Eyes.<br>
<br>
Torah is the set of instructions, originally just the first five books of the Old Testament.<br>
Today, the best definition of Torah, our true set of instructions, would be all of the 66 books of the Holy Bible.<br>
<br>
Abba is the Hebrew word for Father.<br>
<br>
Muh-She-Uck Yeh-Shoe-Uh means, Messiah Salvation.<br>
Messiah is another name for the title of Christ.<br>
Salvation is a direct reference to Jesus. Jesus is Salvation.<br>
To say in Hebrew that Jesus is Salvation, one would say, Jaw-Who-Shaw is Yeh-Shoe-Uh.<br>
Since Jesus is Salvation, one could say that Muh-She-Uck Yeh-Shoe-Uh is a Hebrew way of saying, Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
From their album, HaDerech L'Tzion (The Road to Zion), here are the words to their 2013 song, Open My Eyes, by Lenny and Varda...<br>
<br>
<br>
Open my eyes<br>
That I might see<br>
Wonderful things hidden in Torah for me<br>
Better than silver<br>
More desired than gold<br>
For Torah is able to restore my soul<br>
Open my eyes<br>
Oh Abba open my eyes<br>
<br>
<br>
Open my eyes<br>
That I might see<br>
Muh-She-Uck Yeh-Shoe-Uh on every page I read<br>
He's the living Torah<br>
He's the Bread of Life<br>
And man may eat thereof and not die<br>
Open my eyes<br>
Oh Abba open my eyes<br>
<br>
<br>
Blessed in the man who meditates<br>
In your Torah both night and day<br>
He's like a tree that's planted by<br>
The rivers of water<br>
His leaf will not wither<br>
And his fruit will bring forth<br>
In its season<br>
In its season<br>
In its season<br>
In its season<br>
<br>
<br>
Open my eyes<br>
That I might see<br>
Muh-She-Uck Yeh-Shoe-Uh on every page I read<br>
He's the living Torah<br>
He's the Bread of Life<br>
And man may eat thereof and not die<br>
Open my eyes<br>
Oh Abba open my eyes<br>
Open my eyes<br>

Does your bible translation make Jesus a liar in John 7:8-10?<br>
<br>
John 7:8 -- NIV, with NIV margin note in round brackets...<br>
You go to the festival. I am not (yet) going up to this festival, because my time has not yet fully come."<br>
<br>
Commentary: The NLT and the NIV almost tell you a lie in John 7:8, unless you read the footnotes and margin notes.<br>
Always read the footnotes and margin notes in the NLT.<br>
Does your Bible translation leave out the word, "Yet?"<br>
<br>
<br>
John 7:8-10 -- KJV<br>
7:8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.<br>
7:9 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.<br>
7:10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 7:8-15 -- NLT<br>
8 You go on. I'm not (yet) going to this festival, because my time has not yet come."<br>
9 After saying these things, Jesus remained in Galilee.<br>
10 But after his brothers left for the festival, Jesus also went, though secretly, staying out of public view.<br>
11 The Jewish leaders tried to find him at the festival and kept asking if anyone had seen him.<br>
12 There was a lot of grumbling about him amongst the crowds. Some argued, "He's a good man," but others said, "He's nothing but a fraud who deceives the people."<br>
13 But no one had the courage to speak favourably about him in public, for they were afraid of getting in trouble with the Jewish leaders.<br>
14 Then, midway through the festival, Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach.<br>
15 The (Jewish) people were surprised when they heard him. "How does he know so much when he hasn't been trained?" they asked.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 7:8-16 -- TS2009<br>
8 "You go up to this festival. I am not yet going up to this festival, for My time has not yet been filled."<br>
9 And having said this to them, He stayed in Galil.<br>
10 But when His brothers had gone up to the festival, then He also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret.<br>
11 The Yeh-Who-Deem, therefore, were seeking Him at the festival, and said, "Where is He?"<br>
12 And there was much grumbling about Him amongst the crowd. Some were saying, "He is good," but others were saying, "No, but He is leading the crowd astray."<br>
13 However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Yeh-Who-Deem.<br>
14 And about the middle of the festival Yah-Who-Shaw went up into the Set-apart Place, and He was teaching.<br>
15 And the Yeh-Who-Deem were marvelling, saying, "How does this Man know letters, not having learned?"<br>
16 Yah-Who-Shaw answered them and said, "My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.<br>
<br>
<br>
"My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me."<br>
Yah-Who-Shaw says this in seven places in the Book of John:<br>
John 3:34; John 7:16; John 8:28;<br>
John 8:40; John 12:49; John 14:24; and John 17:8.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 18:15-20 -- KJV<br>
18:15 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;<br>
18:16 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.<br>
18:17 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.<br>
18:18 I will raise them up a Prophet from amongst their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.<br>
18:19 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.<br>
18:20 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mount Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai.<br>

<br>
Deuteronomy 18:15-22 -- NLT<br>
15 Moses continued, "The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from amongst your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him.<br>
16 For this is what you yourselves requested of the Lord your God when you were assembled at Mount Sinai. You said, 'Don't let us hear the voice of the Lord our God anymore or see this blazing fire, for we will die.'<br>
17 "Then the Lord said to me, 'What they have said is right.<br>
18 I will raise up a prophet like you from amongst their fellow Israelites. I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell the people everything I command him.<br>
19 I will personally deal with anyone who will not listen to the messages the prophet proclaims on my behalf.<br>
20 But any prophet who falsely claims to speak in my name or who speaks in the name of another god must die.'<br>
21 "But you may wonder, 'How will we know whether or not a prophecy is from the Lord?'<br>
22 If the prophet speaks in the Lord's name but his prediction does not happen or come true, you will know that the Lord did not give that message. That prophet has spoken without my authority and need not be feared.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 18:15-22 -- TS2009<br>
15 Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem) shall raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brothers. Listen to Him,<br>
16 according to all you asked of Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim (ELL-Low-Heem) in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, 'Let me not hear again the voice of Yaw-Who-Wah my Elohim, nor let me see this great fire any more, lest I die.'<br>
17 "And Yaw-Who-Wah said to me, 'What they have spoken is good.<br>
18 I shall raise up for them a Prophet like you out of the midst of their brothers. And I shall put My Words in His mouth, and He shall speak to them all that I command Him.<br>
19 And it shall be, the man who does not listen to My Words which He speaks in My Name, I require it of him.<br>
20 But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in My Name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other mighty ones, even that prophet shall die.'<br>
21 "And when you say in your heart, 'How do we know the word which Yaw-Who-Wah has not spoken?' --<br>
22 when the prophet speaks in the Name of Yaw-Who-Wah and the word is not, or comes not, that is the word which Yaw-Who-Wah has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him.<br>

2 Corinthians 3:17 -- KJV<br>
Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 3:14, and we keep reading until we get to 2 Corinthians 4:1 -- NLT<br>
14 But the people’s minds were hardened, and to this day whenever the old covenant is being read, the same veil covers their minds so they cannot understand the truth. And this veil can be removed only by believing in Christ.<br>
15 Yes, even today when they read Moses’ writings, their hearts are covered with that veil, and they do not understand.<br>
16 But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.<br>
17 For the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.<br>
18 So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord. And the Lord—who is the Spirit—makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his glorious image.<br>
(Therefore, since God in his mercy has given us this ministry, we never give up.)<br>
1 Therefore, since God in his mercy has given us this new way, we never give up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 3:14, and we keep reading until we get to 2 Corinthians 4:1 -- TS2009<br>
14 But their minds were hardened, for to this day, when the old covenant is being read, that same veil remains, not lifted, because in Messiah it is taken away.<br>
15 But to this day, when Moh-Shay (Moses) is being read, a veil lies on their heart.<br>
16 And when one turns to the Master, the veil is taken away.<br>
17 Now Yaw-Who-Wah is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of Yaw-Who-Wah is, there is freedom.<br>
18 And we all, as with unveiled face we see as in a mirror the esteem of Yaw-Who-Wah, are being transformed into the same likeness from esteem to esteem, as from Yaw-Who-Wah, the Spirit.<br>
1 Therefore, having this service, even as we received compassion, we do not lose heart,<br>

Scott Turner prayed,<br>
"Father, the Bible says that blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.<br>
Father, today we honour You in Your rightful place and thank You for giving us this opportunity to restore faith in this country and be a blessing to the people of America, and we pray in our meeting that You would be glorified in our conversation.<br>

Jeremiah 23: 3-8 -- KJV<br>
23:3 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.<br>
23:4 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.<br>
23:5 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgement and justice in the earth.<br>
23:6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.<br>
23:7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;<br>
23:8 But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.<br>

Jeremiah 23: 1-8 -- NLT<br>
1 "What sorrow awaits the leaders of my people -- the shepherds of my sheep -- for they have destroyed and scattered the very ones they were expected to care for," says the Lord.<br>
2 Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to these shepherds: "Instead of caring for my flock and leading them to safety, you have deserted them and driven them to destruction. Now I will pour out judgement on you for the evil you have done to them.<br>
3 But I will gather together the remnant of my flock from the countries where I have driven them. I will bring them back to their own sheepfold, and they will be fruitful and increase in number.<br>
4 Then I will appoint responsible shepherds who will care for them, and they will never be afraid again. Not a single one will be lost or missing. I, the Lord, have spoken!<br>
5<br>
"For the time is coming,"<br>
says the Lord,<br>
("when I will raise up a righteous branch)<br>

from King David's line.<br>
He will be a King who rules with wisdom.<br>
He will do what is just and right throughout the land.<br>
6<br>
And this will be his name:<br>
'The Lord Is Our Righteousness.'<br>
In that day Judah will be saved,<br>
and Israel will live in safety.<br>
7 "In that day," says the Lord, "when people are taking an oath, they will no longer say, 'As surely as the Lord lives, who rescued the people of Israel from the land of Egypt.'<br>
8 Instead, they will say, 'As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the people of Israel back to their own land from the land of the north and from all the countries to which he had exiled them.' Then they will live in their own land."<br>

Jeremiah 23: 1-8 -- TS2009<br>
1 "Woe to the shepherds destroying and scattering the sheep of My pasture!" declares Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
2 Therefore thus said Yaw-Who-Wah ELL-Low-Heem of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) against the shepherds who feed My people, "You have scattered My flock, driven them away, and have not tended them. See, I am punishing you for the evil of your deeds," declares Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
3 "Therefore I shall gather the remnant of My flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and shall bring them back to their fold. And they shall bear and increase.<br>
4 "And I shall raise up shepherds over them, and they shall feed them. And they shall fear no more, nor be discouraged, nor shall they be lacking," declares Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
5 "See, the days are coming," declares Yaw-Who-Wah, "when I shall raise for Dawid (a Sprout of righteousness,) a Branch of righteousness, and a Sovereign shall reign and act wisely, and shall do right-ruling and righteousness in the earth.<br>
6 "In His days Yeh-Who-Duh (Judah) shall be saved, and Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) dwell safely. And this is His Name whereby He shall be called: 'Yaw-Who-Wah our Righteousness.'<br>
7 "Therefore, see, the days are coming," declares Yaw-Who-Wah, "when they shall say no more, 'As Yaw-Who-Wah lives who brought up the children of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) out of the land of Meets-Rye-EEM (Egypt),'<br>
8 but, 'As Yaw-Who-Wah lives who brought up and led the seed of the house of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) out of the land of the north and from all the lands where I had driven them.' And they shall dwell on their own soil."<br>

Isaiah 43: 1-21 -- KJV<br>
43:1 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.<br>
43:2 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.<br>
43:3 For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.<br>
<br>
43:4 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee:<br>
therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.<br>
(therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy person.)<br>
<br>
43:5 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;<br>
43:6 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;<br>
43:7 Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.<br>
43:8 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.<br>
43:9 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who amongst them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.<br>
<br>
43:10 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen:<br>
that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he:<br>
(before me there was nothing formed of God, neither shall there be after me.)<br>
before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.<br>
<br>
43:11 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.<br>
43:12 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god amongst you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God.<br>
<br>
43:13 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand:<br>
I will work, and who shall let it?<br>
(I will work, and who shall turn it back?)<br>
<br>
43:14 Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;<br>
For your sake I have sent to Babylon,<br>
and have brought down all their nobles,<br>
(and have brought down all their bars,)<br>
and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.<br>
43:15 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.<br>
43:16 Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;<br>
43:17 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.<br>
43:18 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.<br>
43:19 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.<br>
43:20 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls:<br>
(and the ostriches)<br>
(and the daughters of the owl)<br>
because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.<br>
43:21 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 43: 1-21 -- NLT<br>
1<br>
But now, O Jacob, listen to the Lord who created you.<br>
O Israel, the one who formed you says,<br>
"Do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you.<br>
I have called you by name; you are mine.<br>
2<br>
When you go through deep waters,<br>
I will be with you.<br>
When you go through rivers of difficulty,<br>
you will not drown.<br>
When you walk through the fire of oppression,<br>
you will not be burned up;<br>
the flames will not consume you.<br>
3<br>
For I am the Lord, your God,<br>
the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour.<br>
I gave Egypt as a ransom for your freedom;<br>
(I gave Cush and Seba in your place.)<br>
I gave Ethiopia and Seba in your place.<br>
4<br>
Others were given in exchange for you.<br>
I traded their lives for yours<br>
because you are precious to me.<br>
You are honoured, and I love you.<br>
5<br>
"Do not be afraid, for I am with you.<br>
I will gather you and your children from east and west.<br>
6<br>
I will say to the north and south,<br>
'Bring my sons and daughters back to Israel<br>
from the distant corners of the earth.<br>
7<br>
Bring all who claim me as their God,<br>
for I have made them for my glory.<br>
It was I who created them.'"<br>
8<br>
Bring out the people who have eyes but are blind,<br>
who have ears but are deaf.<br>
9<br>
Gather the nations together!<br>
Assemble the peoples of the world!<br>
Which of their idols has ever foretold such things?<br>
Which can predict what will happen tomorrow?<br>
Where are the witnesses of such predictions?<br>
Who can verify that they spoke the truth?<br>
10<br>
"But you are my witnesses, O Israel!" says the Lord.<br>
"You are my servant.<br>
You have been chosen to know me, believe in me,<br>
and understand that I alone am God.<br>
There is no other God --<br>
there never has been, and there never will be.<br>
11<br>
I, yes I, am the Lord,<br>
and there is no other Saviour.<br>
12<br>
First I predicted your rescue,<br>
then I saved you and proclaimed it to the world.<br>
No foreign god has ever done this.<br>
You are witnesses that I am the only God,"<br>
says the Lord.<br>
13<br>
"From eternity to eternity I am God.<br>
No one can snatch anyone out of my hand.<br>
No one can undo what I have done."<br>
14<br>
This is what the Lord says -- your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:<br>
"For your sakes I will send an army against Babylon,<br>
(forcing the Chaldeans to flee in those ships they are so proud of.)<br>
forcing the Babylonians to flee in those ships they are so proud of.<br>
15<br>
I am the Lord, your Holy One,<br>
Israel's Creator and King.<br>
16<br>
I am the Lord, who opened a way through the waters,<br>
making a dry path through the sea.<br>
17<br>
I called forth the mighty army of Egypt<br>
with all its chariots and horses.<br>
I drew them beneath the waves, and they drowned,<br>
their lives snuffed out like a smouldering candlewick.<br>
18<br>
"But forget all that --<br>
it is nothing compared to what I am going to do.<br>
19<br>
For I am about to do something new.<br>
See, I have already begun! Do you not see it?<br>
I will make a pathway through the wilderness.<br>
I will create rivers in the dry wasteland.<br>
20<br>
The wild animals in the fields will thank me,<br>
the jackals and owls, too,<br>
for giving them water in the desert.<br>
Yes, I will make rivers in the dry wasteland<br>
so my chosen people can be refreshed.<br>
21<br>
I have made Israel for myself,<br>
and they will someday honour me before the whole world.<br>

Isaiah 43: 1-21 -- TS2009<br>
1 But now, thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, your Creator, O Yaw-Coav, and He who formed you, O Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), "Do not fear, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by your name, you are Mine.<br>
2 "When you pass through the waters, I am with you; and through rivers, they do not overflow you. When you walk through fire, you are not scorched, and a flame does not burn you.<br>
3 "For I am Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem, the Set-apart One of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), your Saviour; I gave Meets-Rye-EEM (Egypt) for your ransom, Kush and Seba in your place.<br>
4 "Since you were precious in My eyes, you have been esteemed, and I have loved you. And I give men in your place, and peoples for your life.<br>
5 "Do not fear, for I am with you. I shall bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west.<br>
6 "I shall say to the north, 'Give them up!' And to the south, 'Do not keep them back!' Bring My sons from afar, and My daughters from the ends of the earth --<br>
7 all those who are called by My Name, whom I have created, formed, even made for My esteem."<br>
8 He shall bring out a blind people who have eyes, and deaf ones who have ears.<br>
9 All the nations shall be assembled, and the peoples be gathered. Who amongst them declares this, and show us former events? Let them give their witnesses, to be declared right; or let them hear and say, "It is truth."<br>
10 "You are My witnesses," declares Yaw-Who-Wah, "And My servant whom I have chosen, so that you know and believe Me, and understand that I am He. Before Me there was no ELL formed, nor after Me there is none.<br>
11 "I, I am Yaw-Who-Wah, and besides Me there is no saviour.<br>
12 "I, I have declared and saved, and made known, and there was no foreign mighty one amongst you. And you are My witnesses," declares Yaw-Who-Wah, "that I am ELL.<br>
13 "Even from the day I am He, and no one delivers out of My hand. I work, and who turns it back?"<br>
14 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, your Redeemer, the Set-apart One of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), "For your sake I shall send to Babel, and bring them all down as fugitives, even the Kasdim, (the Chaldeans,) who rejoice in their ships.<br>
15 "I am Yaw-Who-Wah, your Set-apart One, Creator of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL), your Sovereign."<br>
16 Thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, who makes a way in the sea and a path through the mighty waters,<br>
17 who brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power (they lie down together, they do not rise, they have been extinguished, they have been quenched like a wick):<br>
18 "Do not remember the former events, nor consider the events of old.<br>
19 "See, I am doing what is new, let it now spring forth. Do you not know it? I am even making a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.<br>
20 "The beast of the field esteems Me, the jackals and the ostriches, because I have given waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen,<br>
21 this people I have formed for Myself, let them relate My praise.<br>

"Who kept the sea inside its boundaries<br>
as it burst from the womb,<br>
9<br>
and as I clothed it with clouds<br>
and wrapped it in thick darkness?<br>
10<br>
For I locked it behind barred gates,<br>
limiting its shores.<br>
11<br>

Who taught the sun<br>

You can only come this far<br>
And who showed the moon<br>
Where to hide till evening<br>
Whose words alone can<br>
Catch a falling star<br>
<br>
<br>
Well I know my Redeemer lives<br>
I know my Redeemer lives<br>
All of creation testifies<br>
This life within me cries<br>
I know my Redeemer lives<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
<br>
The very same God<br>
That spins things in orbit<br>
Runs to the weary<br>
The worn and the weak<br>
And the same gentle hands<br>
That hold me when I'm broken<br>
They conquer death to bring me victory<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I know my Redeemer lives<br>
I know my Redeemer lives<br>
Let all creation testify<br>
Let this life within me cry<br>
I know my Redeemer<br>
<br>
<br>
He lives to take away my shame<br>
And He lives forever I'll proclaim<br>
That the payment for my sin<br>
Was the precious life He gave<br>
But now He's alive and there's an empty grave<br>
<br>
<br>
And I know my Redeemer, He lives<br>
I know my Redeemer lives<br>

Because He lives I can face tomorrow<br>
He lives, I know, I know<br>
He lives, He lives, Yeah Yeah<br>

Revelation 1: 5-7 (KJV)<br>
1:5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,<br>
1:6 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,....<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 5: 9 & 10 (KJV)<br>
5:9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;<br>
5:10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
When the time comes when He gathers us saints, us set-apart believers, we are the living stones that will be beautiful, precious gemstones that are in the New Jerusalem.<br>
Not a single stone, not even the least of those precious gemstones, not even the least of those living stones, will fall to the earth.<br>
We, the living stones are kings and priests. What the Bible says for kings and priests may apply to us, because we are kings and priests, citizens of the New Jerusalem.<br>
Not a single one of his precious, valuable grains shall fall to the earth. None of His should perish in His wrath.<br>
He clearly sees and knows the difference between every single one of his valuable grain, and worthless chaff, between the wheat and the weeds, between the sheep and the goats.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2: 3-5 (KJV)<br>
...the Lord is gracious.<br>
2:4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,<br>
(Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house,)<br>
2:5 Ye also, as lively stones, be ye built a spiritual house,<br>
an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2: 2-5 (NLT)<br>
...Cry out for this nourishment,<br>
3 now that you have had a taste of the Lord's kindness.<br>
4 You are coming to Christ, who is the living cornerstone of God's temple. He was rejected by people, but he was chosen by God for great honour.<br>
5 And you are living stones that God is building into his spiritual temple.<br>
(What's more, you are his holy priesthood.)<br>
What's more, you are his holy priests. Through the mediation of Jesus Christ, you offer spiritual sacrifices that please God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2: 3-5 (TS2009)<br>
3 ...if indeed you have tasted that the Master is good.<br>
4 Drawing near to Him, a living Stone – rejected indeed by men, but chosen by ELL-Low-Heem and precious --<br>
5 you also, as living stones, are being built up, a spiritual house, a set-apart priesthood, to offer up spiritual slaughter offerings acceptable to ELL-Low-Heem through Yaw-Who-Shaw Muh-She-Uck.<br>

Amos 9: 8-10 -- NLT<br>
(...I will never completely destroy the house of Jacob,")<br>
...I will never completely destroy the family of Israel,"<br>
says the Lord.<br>
9<br>
"For I will give the command<br>
and will shake Israel along with the other nations<br>
as grain is shaken in a sieve,<br>
yet not one true kernel will be lost.<br>
10<br>
But all the sinners will die by the sword --<br>
all those who say, 'Nothing bad will happen to us.'<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Amos 9: 8 & 9 -- TS2009<br>
...I do not completely destroy the house of Yah-Coav" declares Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
9 "For look, I am commanding, and I shall sift the house of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) among all the nations, as one sifts with a sieve, yet not a grain falls to the ground.<br>
("For look, I am commanding, and I shall shake the house of Yis-Rye-ELL (Yaw-Shaw-ReLL) among all the nations, as one shakes with a sieve, yet not a grain falls to the ground.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Amos 9: 8 & 9 -- KJV<br>
...I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.<br>
9:9 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.<br>
(For, lo, I will command, and I will cause to move the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least stone fall upon the earth.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Amos 9: 8 & 9 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (1560)<br>
...Nevertheless I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.<br>
9 For lo, I will command and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve: yet shall not the least stone fall upon the earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is what is says<br>
in the Geneva Bible margin notes from 1560,<br>
In verse 9, where it says, <br>
yet shall not ye least stone fall upon the earth,<br>
Meaning, none of His should perish in His wrath.<br>

Here is yet another song from Phil Wickham that has been very treasured and important to my family for many years.<br>
<br>
Phil Wickham is an American contemporary Christian singer, musician and songwriter from San Diego, California.<br>
As of April of 2025, he had released ten worship albums.<br>
The song that we will be considering here, next, is titled, You're Beautiful.<br>
<br>
You're Beautiful comes from his second commercial studio album, Cannons, released on 2 October 2007.<br>
<br>
<br>
From his album, Cannons, here are the words to his 2007 song, You're Beautiful, by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I see Your face in every sunrise<br>
The colours of the morning are inside Your eyes<br>
The world awakens in the light of the day<br>
I look up to the sky and say<br>
You're beautiful<br>
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)<br>
<br>
<br>
I see Your power in the moonlit night<br>
Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright<br>
We are amazed in the light of the stars<br>
It's all proclaiming who You are<br>
You're beautiful<br>
(Oh, Oh, You're beautiful, Oh, Oh)<br>
<br>
<br>
I see You there hanging on a tree<br>
You bled and then You died and then You rose again for me<br>
Now You are sitting on Your heavenly throne<br>
Soon we will be coming home<br>
You're beautiful<br>
(Oh, Oh, You're beautiful, Oh, Oh)<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's sing it out<br>
When we arrive at eternity's shore<br>
Where death is just a memory and tears are no more<br>
We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring<br>
Your bride will come together and we'll sing<br>
You're beautiful<br>
<br>
Oh, You're beautiful<br>
<br>
<br>
I see Your face, You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful<br>
<br>
<br>
I see Your face, You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful<br>
<br>
<br>
I see Your face<br>
I see Your face<br>
I see Your face, You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
