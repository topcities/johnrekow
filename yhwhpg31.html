Let's take a moment to read the lyrics to a few interesting Christian songs.<br>
<br>
At the end of August 2022, my family was enjoying two new songs from TobyMac's latest album, which had just been released.<br>
<br>
One of those songs featured TobyMac with his mates from DC Talk, basically performing what could be thought of as a brand new song from DC Talk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TobyMac was originally a member of DC Talk from 1987 to 2001.<br>
Since 2001, TobyMac has released eight studio albums, two Christmas albums, five remix albums, three live albums, and three extended plays as a solo artist.<br>
<br>
<br>
His eighth studio album, Life After Death<br>
was released on<br>
Friday 19 August 2022<br>
and is available as a digital download, a physical Audio CD, or as an analogue, vinyl long-playing record.<br>
<br>
<br>
The title of this album, and some of the content in his recent songs may be influenced by the tragic death of his son.<br>
TobyMac has five children, and it was his firstborn son,<br>
Truett McKeehan, that was found dead at his home in Nashville on 23 October 2019, at age 21,<br>
of what appears to be, or what has been said to be,<br>
an accidental drug overdose of fentanyl and amphetamines.<br>
<br>
One of the songs on the Life After Death album is titled, Faithfully.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2022 song, Faithfully, by TobyMac...<br>
<br>
<br>
It's been a long year<br>
It almost took me down, I swear<br>
Life was so good<br>
I'm not so sure we knew what we had<br>
I'll never be the same man<br>
I'll never feel like I felt before<br>
like I felt before<br>
It's been a hard year<br>
It almost took me down<br>
<br>
<br>
But when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
I've had a hard time<br>
Findin' the blue in the skies above me<br>
And if I'm keepin' it real<br>
I've been half-fakin' the happy they'd see<br>
I may look like the same man<br>
But I'm half the man I was (Half the man I was)<br>
It's been a hard year<br>
It almost took me down<br>
<br>
<br>
But when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
In my darkest hour, You met me<br>
So quietly, so gently<br>
You said You'd never leave<br>
And you stood by Your word<br>
So quietly, so gently<br>
In all my pain, You met me<br>
You said You'd never leave<br>
And you stood by Your word<br>
<br>
<br>
'Cause when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

Here are the words to the 2022 song, titled, Space, featuring DC Talk, available on<br>
TobyMac's album, Life After Death.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I've replayed it like a thousand times, I rewind it in my head<br>
I can tell you that I lost my mind, or what I should've done instead<br>
'Cause the way that I felt when we parted ways<br>
Got me all in my head, got me countin' the days<br>
Got me hopin', got me prayin'<br>
You are in my heart<br>
<br>
<br>
But what do we do with this space<br>
What do we do with this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
How can we start to erase<br>
space, space<br>
How can we start to erase this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>
Would you step across a party line?<br>
Would you walk into my cold cell?<br>
Can you see me in a different light?<br>
Would you meet me at the well?<br>
Would you?<br>
<br>
<br>
'Cause the way that I feel when you look my way<br>
Got me all in my head, got me starting to think<br>
Is it too far? Are we too scarred?<br>
too scarred?<br>
Yeah the heart is there, but what do we do with this space<br>
<br>
<br>
Space, space<br>
What do we do with this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
How can we start to erase<br>
space, space<br>
How can we start to erase this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>

Yeah, I've got nothing but love for you<br>
Nothing but my love for you<br>
And I know you feel the same way too<br>
know you feel the same way too<br>
But this space, what do we do with this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>
What do we do with this space<br>
This space<br>
Oh, Oh. Woah!<br>
<br>
It keeps no record, it keeps no record of wrong<br>
It keeps no record, record, record<br>
<br>
Oh,<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record of wrong<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
We're never too far gone<br>
<br>
<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record of wrong<br>

Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
We're never too far gone<br>

At the end of August 2022, my family was also remembering and appreciating a great song that came out many years ago by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the lyrics to an older song by Phil Wickham.<br>
As of August 2022, Phil Wickham has released nine albums.<br>
His album, The Ascension, his fifth commercial studio album, was released on<br>
24 September 2013.<br>
The standard edition contained just the regular, studio recordings,<br>
and the Deluxe edition also included an acoustic recording of all of the tracks as well.<br>
<br>
From this 2013 album, The Ascension, we will now be looking at the song, titled, Over All.<br>
Here are the words to the 2013 song, Over All, by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Micah 7: 7-20 (NIV)<br>
7<br>
But as for me, I watch in hope for the Lord,<br>
I wait for God my Saviour;<br>
my God will hear me.<br>
8<br>
Do not gloat over me, my enemy!<br>
Though I have fallen, I will rise.<br>
Though I sit in darkness,<br>
the Lord will be my light.<br>
9<br>
Because I have sinned against him,<br>
I will bear the Lord's wrath,<br>
until he pleads my case<br>
and upholds my cause.<br>
He will bring me out into the light;<br>
I will see his righteousness.<br>
10<br>
Then my enemy will see it<br>
and will be covered with shame,<br>
she who said to me,<br>
"Where is the Lord your God?"<br>
My eyes will see her downfall;<br>
even now she will be trampled underfoot<br>
like mire in the streets.<br>
11<br>
The day for building your walls will come,<br>
the day for extending your boundaries.<br>
12<br>
In that day people will come to you<br>
from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,<br>
even from Egypt to the Euphrates<br>
and from sea to sea<br>
and from mountain to mountain.<br>
13<br>
The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants,<br>
as the result of their deeds.<br>
14<br>
Shepherd your people with your staff,<br>
the flock of your inheritance,<br>
which lives by itself in a forest,<br>
in fertile pasturelands.<br>
(in the middle of Carmel)<br>
Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead<br>
as in days long ago.<br>
15<br>
"As in the days when you came out of Egypt,<br>
I will show them my wonders."<br>
16<br>
Nations will see and be ashamed,<br>
deprived of all their power.<br>
They will put their hands over their mouths<br>
and their ears will become deaf.<br>
17<br>
They will lick dust like a snake,<br>
like creatures that crawl on the ground.<br>
They will come trembling out of their dens;<br>
they will turn in fear to the Lord our God<br>
and will be afraid of you.<br>
18<br>
Who is a God like you,<br>
who pardons sin and forgives the transgression<br>
of the remnant of his inheritance?<br>
You do not stay angry forever<br>
but delight to show mercy.<br>
19<br>
You will again have compassion on us;<br>
you will tread our sins underfoot<br>
and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.<br>
20<br>
You will be faithful to Jacob,<br>
and show love to Abraham,<br>
as you pledged on oath to our ancestors<br>
in days long ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 7-20 (KJV)<br>
7:7 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.<br>
7:8 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.<br>
7:9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgement for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.<br>
<br>
<br>
(And thou wilt see her that is mine enemy and cover her with shame which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now she shall be for a treading down as the mire of the streets.)<br>
7:10 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.<br>
<br>
7:11 In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed.<br>
<br>
(In that day also he shall come even to thee, even to Assyria, and even to the fortified cities, and even to the fortress, even to the river, and even to sea to sea, and even to mountain to mountain.)<br>
7:12 In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.<br>
<br>
(After that it hath been the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.)<br>
7:13 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.<br>
<br>
(Rule thy people with thy rod,)<br>
7:14 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them Feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.<br>
<br>
7:15 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things.<br>
7:16 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.<br>
<br>
7:17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent,<br>
(they shall move out of their holes like creeping things of the earth)<br>
they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.<br>
<br>
7:18 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.<br>
7:19 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<br>
7:20 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 7-20 (NLT)<br>
7<br>
As for me, I look to the Lord for help.<br>
I wait confidently for God to save me,<br>
and my God will certainly hear me.<br>
8<br>
Do not gloat over me, my enemies!<br>
For though I fall, I will rise again.<br>
Though I sit in darkness,<br>
the Lord will be my light.<br>
9<br>
I will be patient as the Lord punishes me,<br>
for I have sinned against him.<br>
But after that, he will take up my case<br>
and give me justice for all I have suffered from my enemies.<br>
The Lord will bring me into the light,<br>
and I will see his righteousness.<br>
10<br>
Then my enemies will see that the Lord is on my side.<br>
They will be ashamed that they taunted me, saying,<br>
"So where is the Lord --<br>
that God of yours?"<br>
With my own eyes I will see their downfall;<br>
they will be trampled like mud in the streets.<br>
11<br>
In that day, Israel, your cities will be rebuilt,<br>
and your borders will be extended.<br>
12<br>
People from many lands will come and honour you --<br>
from Assyria all the way to the towns of Egypt,<br>
from Egypt all the way to (the river,) the Euphrates River,<br>
and from distant seas and mountains.<br>
13<br>
But (the earth and) the land will become empty and desolate<br>
because of the wickedness of those who live there.<br>
14<br>
O Lord, protect your people with your shepherd's staff;<br>
lead your flock, your special possession.<br>
Though they live alone in a thicket<br>
(surrounded by a fruitful land)<br>
on the heights of Mount Carmel,<br>
let them graze in the fertile pastures of Bashan and Gilead<br>
as they did long ago.<br>
15<br>
"Yes," says the Lord,<br>
"I will do mighty miracles for you,<br>
like those I did when I rescued you<br>
from slavery in Egypt."<br>
16<br>
All the nations of the world will stand amazed<br>
at what the Lord will do for you.<br>
They will be embarrassed<br>
at their feeble power.<br>
They will cover their mouths in silent awe,<br>
deaf to everything around them.<br>
17<br>
Like snakes crawling from their holes,<br>
they will come out to meet the Lord our God.<br>
They will fear him greatly,<br>
trembling in terror at his presence.<br>
18<br>
Where is another God like you,<br>
who pardons the guilt of the remnant,<br>
overlooking the sins of his special people?<br>
You will not stay angry with your people forever,<br>
because you delight in showing unfailing love.<br>
19<br>
Once again you will have compassion on us.<br>
You will trample our sins under your feet<br>
and throw them into the depths of the ocean!<br>
20<br>
You will show us your faithfulness and unfailing love<br>
as you promised to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob long ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 5-20 (TS2009)<br>
5 Trust no friend, rely on no companion, guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom.<br>
6 For son is despising father, daughter rises up against her mother, daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, the enemies of a man are the men of his own house.<br>
7 As for me, I look to Yah-Who-Wah, I wait for the ELL-Low-Heem of my deliverance, my ELL-Low-Heem does hear me.<br>
8 Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy. When I have fallen I have risen, when I sit in darkness Yah-Who-Wah is a light to me.<br>
9 I bear the displeasure of Yah-Who-Wah, for I have sinned against Him, until He pleads my case, and shall execute right-ruling for me, until He brings me out into the light and I look on His righteousness.<br>
10 And let my enemy see it, and let shame cover her who said to me, "Where is Yah-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem?" Let my eyes look on her: now she is trampled down like mud in the streets.<br>
<br>
(Siege could be another name for Mitsrayim.)<br>
<br>
11 The day for building your walls! Let the law go far and wide in that day  --<br>
12 that day when they come to you from Ashshur and the besieged cities of Mitsrayim, (from Mitsrayim to the River) and from the siege to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.<br>
13 But the earth shall become a waste because of those who dwell in it, and for the fruit of their deeds.<br>
14 Shepherd Your people with Your rod, the flock of Your inheritance, who dwell alone in a forest, in the midst of Karmel (Care-Mel). Let them feed in Bashan and Gill-Odd, as in days of old.<br>
15 "As in the days when you came out of the land of Mitsrayim, I shall let him see wonders."<br>
16 Let the nations see and be ashamed of all their might, let them put their hand over their mouth, let their ears be deaf.<br>
17 Let them lick the dust like a serpent, let them come trembling from their strongholds like snakes of the earth, let them be afraid of Yah-Who-Wah our ELL-Low-Heem and fear because of You.<br>
18 Who is an ELL-Low-Heem like You  --  taking away crookedness and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance? He shall not retain His wrath forever, for He Himself delights in loving-commitment.<br>
19 He shall turn back, He shall have compassion on us, He shall trample upon our crookednesses! And You throw all our sins into the depths of the sea!<br>
20 You give truth to Yah-Coab, loving-commitment to Ah-Vrah-Hahm, which You swore to our fathers from the days of old!<br>
<br>
