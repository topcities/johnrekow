Let's take a moment to read the lyrics to a few interesting Christian songs.<br>
<br>
At the end of August 2022, my family was enjoying two new songs from TobyMac's latest album, which had just been released.<br>
<br>
One of those songs featured TobyMac with his mates from DC Talk, basically performing what could be thought of as a brand new song from DC Talk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TobyMac was originally a member of DC Talk from 1987 to 2001.<br>
Since 2001, TobyMac has released eight studio albums, two Christmas albums, five remix albums, three live albums, and three extended plays as a solo artist.<br>
<br>
<br>
His eighth studio album, Life After Death<br>
was released on<br>
Friday 19 August 2022<br>
and is available as a digital download, a physical Audio CD, or as an analogue, vinyl long-playing record.<br>
<br>
<br>
The title of this album, and some of the content in his recent songs may be influenced by the tragic death of his son.<br>
TobyMac has five children, and it was his firstborn son,<br>
Truett McKeehan, that was found dead at his home in Nashville on 23 October 2019, at age 21,<br>
of what appears to be, or what has been said to be,<br>
an accidental drug overdose of fentanyl and amphetamines.<br>
<br>
One of the songs on the Life After Death album is titled, Faithfully.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2022 song, Faithfully, by TobyMac...<br>
<br>
<br>
It's been a long year<br>
It almost took me down, I swear<br>
Life was so good<br>
I'm not so sure we knew what we had<br>
I'll never be the same man<br>
I'll never feel like I felt before<br>
like I felt before<br>
It's been a hard year<br>
It almost took me down<br>
<br>
<br>
But when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
I've had a hard time<br>
Findin' the blue in the skies above me<br>
And if I'm keepin' it real<br>
I've been half-fakin' the happy they'd see<br>
I may look like the same man<br>
But I'm half the man I was (Half the man I was)<br>
It's been a hard year<br>
It almost took me down<br>
<br>
<br>
But when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
In my darkest hour, You met me<br>
So quietly, so gently<br>
You said You'd never leave<br>
And you stood by Your word<br>
So quietly, so gently<br>
In all my pain, You met me<br>
You said You'd never leave<br>
And you stood by Your word<br>
<br>
<br>
'Cause when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

DC Talk is a Christian rap and rock trio.<br>
They have been together since 1987.<br>
They have released five DC Talk studio albums, from 1989 through 1998.<br>
Their most recent album was a live concert album, that came out in 2021.<br>
They are still occasionally active, and recently created a new song together, titled, Space, that appears on<br>
TobyMac's 2022 album, Life After Death.<br>
<br>
TobyMac is the stage name for Toby McKeehan, and it is he, along with Kevin Max and Michael Tait, that form the band, DC Talk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Other artists featured on the Life After Death album, include<br>
Blessing Offor<br>
Tauren Wells<br>
Jon Reddick<br>
Sheryl Crow<br>
Marlee<br>
Sarah Reeves<br>
Zach Williams<br>
Terrian<br>
Wande<br>
Cory Asbury, and<br>
Gabe Real<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2022 song, titled, Space, featuring DC Talk, available on<br>
TobyMac's album, Life After Death.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I've replayed it like a thousand times, I rewind it in my head<br>
I can tell you that I lost my mind, or what I should've done instead<br>
'Cause the way that I felt when we parted ways<br>
Got me all in my head, got me countin' the days<br>
Got me hopin', got me prayin'<br>
You are in my heart<br>
<br>
<br>
But what do we do with this space<br>
What do we do with this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
How can we start to erase<br>
space, space<br>
How can we start to erase this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>
Would you step across a party line?<br>
Would you walk into my cold cell?<br>
Can you see me in a different light?<br>
Would you meet me at the well?<br>
Would you?<br>
<br>
<br>
'Cause the way that I feel when you look my way<br>
Got me all in my head, got me starting to think<br>
Is it too far? Are we too scarred?<br>
too scarred?<br>
Yeah the heart is there, but what do we do with this space<br>
<br>
<br>
Space, space<br>
What do we do with this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
How can we start to erase<br>
space, space<br>
How can we start to erase this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>

Yeah, I've got nothing but love for you<br>
Nothing but my love for you<br>
And I know you feel the same way too<br>
know you feel the same way too<br>
But this space, what do we do with this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>
What do we do with this space<br>
This space<br>
Oh, Oh. Woah!<br>
<br>
It keeps no record, it keeps no record of wrong<br>
It keeps no record, record, record<br>
<br>
Oh,<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record of wrong<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
We're never too far gone<br>
<br>
<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record of wrong<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
We're never too far gone<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
No record<br>
Love keeps no record of wrong<br>
It keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
We're never too far gone<br>

At the end of August 2022, my family was also remembering and appreciating a great song that came out many years ago by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the lyrics to an older song by Phil Wickham.<br>
As of August 2022, Phil Wickham has released nine albums.<br>
His album, The Ascension, his fifth commercial studio album, was released on<br>
24 September 2013.<br>
The standard edition contained just the regular, studio recordings,<br>
and the Deluxe edition also included an acoustic recording of all of the tracks as well.<br>
<br>
From this 2013 album, The Ascension, we will now be looking at the song, titled, Over All.<br>
Here are the words to the 2013 song, Over All, by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Over our hopes, over our fear<br>
God, you are over all<br>
Over our joy; over our tears<br>
God, you are over all<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Over our hopes, over our fear<br>
God, you are over all<br>
Over our joy; over our tears<br>
God, you are over all<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Over the earth, over the sky<br>
God, you are over all<br>
Over the dark; over the light<br>
God, you are over all<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Over the earth, over the sky<br>
God, you are over all<br>
Whatever may come in this life<br>
God, you are over all<br>
<br>
<br>
Great in power,<br>
Exalted and lifted high<br>
God, you will reign forever,<br>
Forever we will glorify<br>
The God over all,<br>
