Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

Let's take a moment to read the lyrics to a few interesting Christian songs.<br>
<br>
At the end of August 2022, my family was enjoying two new songs from TobyMac's latest album, which had just been released.<br>
<br>
One of those songs featured TobyMac with his mates from DC Talk, basically performing what could be thought of as a brand new song from DC Talk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TobyMac was originally a member of DC Talk from 1987 to 2001.<br>
Since 2001, TobyMac has released eight studio albums, two Christmas albums, five remix albums, three live albums, and three extended plays as a solo artist.<br>
<br>
<br>
His eighth studio album, Life After Death<br>
was released on<br>
Friday 19 August 2022<br>
and is available as a digital download, a physical Audio CD, or as an analogue, vinyl long-playing record.<br>
<br>
<br>
The title of this album, and some of the content in his recent songs may be influenced by the tragic death of his son.<br>
TobyMac has five children, and it was his firstborn son,<br>
Truett McKeehan, that was found dead at his home in Nashville on 23 October 2019, at age 21,<br>
of what appears to be, or what has been said to be,<br>
an accidental drug overdose of fentanyl and amphetamines.<br>
<br>
One of the songs on the Life After Death album is titled, Faithfully.<br>
<br>
In 2023, this song was slightly remixed into a Single Version and released as a single.<br>
The main difference in this remixed Single Version, is that this remix does not quiet down in the middle, at the bridge.<br>
<br>
The Single Version was released for promotional use to radio stations on 29 September 2023,<br>
and the Music Video for the Single Version premiered on 27 October 2023.<br>
By Mid-November, the Single Version of this song, Faithfully, was one of the top 20 most popular Christian Songs throughout November 2023.<br>
<br>
<br>
At the end of December of 2024, "20 The Countdown Magazine" reported that their<br>
Number Two most popular Christian Song for the year of 2024 was<br>
TobyMac, and his song, Faithfully (2023 Single Version).<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, the Number One most popular Christian Song for the year of 2024<br>
at "20 The Countdown Magazine" was the song,<br>
Praise<br>
by<br>
Elevation Worship.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
From his album, Life After Death, here are the words to the 2022 song, Faithfully, by TobyMac...<br>
<br>
<br>
It's been a long year<br>
It almost took me down, I swear<br>
Life was so good<br>
I'm not so sure we knew what we had<br>
I'll never be the same man<br>
I'll never feel like I felt before<br>
like I felt before<br>
It's been a hard year<br>
It almost took me down<br>
<br>
<br>
But when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
I've had a hard time<br>
Findin' the blue in the skies above me<br>
And if I'm keepin' it real<br>
I've been half-fakin' the happy they'd see<br>
I may look like the same man<br>
But I'm half the man I was (Half the man I was)<br>
It's been a hard year<br>
It almost took me down<br>
<br>
<br>
But when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
In my darkest hour, You met me<br>
So quietly, so gently<br>
You said You'd never leave<br>
And you stood by Your word<br>
So quietly, so gently<br>
In all my pain, You met me<br>
You said You'd never leave<br>
And you stood by Your word<br>
<br>
<br>
'Cause when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>

at the Cross Rhythms Christian radio network in Stoke-on-Trent, England,<br>
which is about 170 miles north west of London,<br>
or about 53 miles south of Manchester.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2022 song, titled, Space, featuring DC Talk, available on<br>
TobyMac's album, Life After Death.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I've replayed it like a thousand times, I rewind it in my head<br>
I can tell you that I lost my mind, or what I should've done instead<br>
'Cause the way that I felt when we parted ways<br>
Got me all in my head, got me countin' the days<br>
Got me hopin', got me prayin'<br>
You are in my heart<br>
<br>
<br>
But what do we do with this space<br>
What do we do with this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
How can we start to erase<br>
space, space<br>
How can we start to erase this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>
Would you step across a party line?<br>
Would you walk into my cold cell?<br>
Can you see me in a different light?<br>
Would you meet me at the well?<br>
Would you?<br>
<br>
<br>
'Cause the way that I feel when you look my way<br>
Got me all in my head, got me starting to think<br>
Is it too far? Are we too scarred?<br>
too scarred?<br>
Yeah the heart is there, but what do we do with this space<br>
<br>
<br>
Space, space<br>
What do we do with this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
How can we start to erase<br>
space, space<br>
How can we start to erase this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>

Yeah, I've got nothing but love for you<br>
Nothing but my love for you<br>
And I know you feel the same way too<br>
know you feel the same way too<br>
But this space, what do we do with this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>
What do we do with this space<br>
This space<br>
Oh, Oh. Woah!<br>

It keeps no record, it keeps no record of wrong<br>

At the end of August 2022, my family was also remembering and appreciating a great song that came out many years ago by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the lyrics to an older song by Phil Wickham.<br>
As of August 2022, Phil Wickham has released nine albums.<br>
His album, The Ascension, his fifth commercial studio album, was released on<br>
24 September 2013.<br>
The standard edition contained just the regular, studio recordings,<br>
and the Deluxe edition also included an acoustic recording of all of the tracks as well.<br>
<br>
From this 2013 album, The Ascension, we will now be looking at the song, titled, Over All.<br>
Here are the words to the 2013 song, Over All, by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Micah 7: 7-20 (NIV)<br>
7<br>
But as for me, I watch in hope for the Lord,<br>
I wait for God my Saviour;<br>
my God will hear me.<br>
8<br>
Do not gloat over me, my enemy!<br>
Though I have fallen, I will rise.<br>
Though I sit in darkness,<br>
the Lord will be my light.<br>
9<br>
Because I have sinned against him,<br>
I will bear the Lord's wrath,<br>
until he pleads my case<br>
and upholds my cause.<br>
He will bring me out into the light;<br>
I will see his righteousness.<br>
10<br>
Then my enemy will see it<br>
and will be covered with shame,<br>
she who said to me,<br>
"Where is the Lord your God?"<br>
My eyes will see her downfall;<br>
even now she will be trampled underfoot<br>
like mire in the streets.<br>
11<br>
The day for building your walls will come,<br>
the day for extending your boundaries.<br>
12<br>
In that day people will come to you<br>
from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,<br>
even from Egypt to the Euphrates<br>
and from sea to sea<br>
and from mountain to mountain.<br>
13<br>
The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants,<br>
as the result of their deeds.<br>
14<br>
Shepherd your people with your staff,<br>
the flock of your inheritance,<br>
which lives by itself in a forest,<br>
in fertile pasturelands.<br>
(in the middle of Carmel)<br>
Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead<br>
as in days long ago.<br>
15<br>
"As in the days when you came out of Egypt,<br>
I will show them my wonders."<br>
16<br>
Nations will see and be ashamed,<br>
deprived of all their power.<br>
They will put their hands over their mouths<br>
and their ears will become deaf.<br>
17<br>
They will lick dust like a snake,<br>
like creatures that crawl on the ground.<br>
They will come trembling out of their dens;<br>
they will turn in fear to the Lord our God<br>
and will be afraid of you.<br>
18<br>
Who is a God like you,<br>
who pardons sin and forgives the transgression<br>
of the remnant of his inheritance?<br>
You do not stay angry forever<br>
but delight to show mercy.<br>
19<br>
You will again have compassion on us;<br>
you will tread our sins underfoot<br>
and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.<br>
20<br>
You will be faithful to Jacob,<br>
and show love to Abraham,<br>
as you pledged on oath to our ancestors<br>
in days long ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 7-20 (KJV)<br>
7:7 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.<br>
7:8 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.<br>
7:9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgement for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.<br>
<br>
<br>
(And thou wilt see her that is mine enemy and cover her with shame which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now she shall be for a treading down as the mire of the streets.)<br>
7:10 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.<br>
<br>
7:11 In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed.<br>
<br>
(In that day also he shall come even to thee, even to Assyria, and even to the fortified cities, and even to the fortress, even to the river, and even to sea to sea, and even to mountain to mountain.)<br>
7:12 In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.<br>
<br>
(After that it hath been the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.)<br>
7:13 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.<br>
<br>
(Rule thy people with thy rod,)<br>
7:14 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them Feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.<br>
<br>
7:15 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things.<br>
7:16 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.<br>
<br>
7:17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent,<br>
(they shall move out of their holes like creeping things of the earth)<br>
they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.<br>
<br>
7:18 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.<br>
7:19 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<br>
7:20 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 7-20 (NLT)<br>
7<br>
As for me, I look to the Lord for help.<br>
I wait confidently for God to save me,<br>
and my God will certainly hear me.<br>
8<br>
Do not gloat over me, my enemies!<br>
For though I fall, I will rise again.<br>
Though I sit in darkness,<br>
the Lord will be my light.<br>
9<br>
I will be patient as the Lord punishes me,<br>
for I have sinned against him.<br>
But after that, he will take up my case<br>
and give me justice for all I have suffered from my enemies.<br>
The Lord will bring me into the light,<br>
and I will see his righteousness.<br>
10<br>
Then my enemies will see that the Lord is on my side.<br>
They will be ashamed that they taunted me, saying,<br>
"So where is the Lord --<br>
that God of yours?"<br>
With my own eyes I will see their downfall;<br>
they will be trampled like mud in the streets.<br>
11<br>
In that day, Israel, your cities will be rebuilt,<br>
and your borders will be extended.<br>
12<br>
People from many lands will come and honour you --<br>
from Assyria all the way to the towns of Egypt,<br>
from Egypt all the way to (the river,) the Euphrates River,<br>
and from distant seas and mountains.<br>
13<br>
But (the earth and) the land will become empty and desolate<br>
because of the wickedness of those who live there.<br>
14<br>
O Lord, protect your people with your shepherd's staff;<br>
lead your flock, your special possession.<br>
Though they live alone in a thicket<br>
(surrounded by a fruitful land)<br>
on the heights of Mount Carmel,<br>
let them graze in the fertile pastures of Bashan and Gilead<br>
as they did long ago.<br>
15<br>
"Yes," says the Lord,<br>
"I will do mighty miracles for you,<br>
like those I did when I rescued you<br>
from slavery in Egypt."<br>
16<br>
All the nations of the world will stand amazed<br>
at what the Lord will do for you.<br>
They will be embarrassed<br>
at their feeble power.<br>
They will cover their mouths in silent awe,<br>
deaf to everything around them.<br>
17<br>
Like snakes crawling from their holes,<br>
they will come out to meet the Lord our God.<br>
They will fear him greatly,<br>
trembling in terror at his presence.<br>
18<br>
Where is another God like you,<br>
who pardons the guilt of the remnant,<br>
overlooking the sins of his special people?<br>
You will not stay angry with your people forever,<br>
because you delight in showing unfailing love.<br>
19<br>
Once again you will have compassion on us.<br>
You will trample our sins under your feet<br>
and throw them into the depths of the ocean!<br>
20<br>
You will show us your faithfulness and unfailing love<br>
as you promised to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob long ago.<br>
<br>

Micah 7: 5-20 (TS2009)<br>
5 Trust no friend, rely on no companion, guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom.<br>
6 For son is despising father, daughter rises up against her mother, daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, the enemies of a man are the men of his own house.<br>
7 As for me, I look to Yah-Who-Wah, I wait for the ELL-Low-Heem of my deliverance, my ELL-Low-Heem does hear me.<br>
8 Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy. When I have fallen I have risen, when I sit in darkness Yah-Who-Wah is a light to me.<br>
9 I bear the displeasure of Yah-Who-Wah, for I have sinned against Him, until He pleads my case, and shall execute right-ruling for me, until He brings me out into the light and I look on His righteousness.<br>
10 And let my enemy see it, and let shame cover her who said to me, "Where is Yah-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem?" Let my eyes look on her: now she is trampled down like mud in the streets.<br>
<br>
(Siege could be another name for Mitsrayim.)<br>
<br>
11 The day for building your walls! Let the law go far and wide in that day  --<br>
12 that day when they come to you from Ashshur and the besieged cities of Mitsrayim, (from Mitsrayim to the River) and from the siege to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.<br>
13 But the earth shall become a waste because of those who dwell in it, and for the fruit of their deeds.<br>
14 Shepherd Your people with Your rod, the flock of Your inheritance, who dwell alone in a forest, in the midst of Karmel (Care-Mel). Let them feed in Bashan and Gill-Odd, as in days of old.<br>
15 "As in the days when you came out of the land of Mitsrayim, I shall let him see wonders."<br>
16 Let the nations see and be ashamed of all their might, let them put their hand over their mouth, let their ears be deaf.<br>
17 Let them lick the dust like a serpent, let them come trembling from their strongholds like snakes of the earth, let them be afraid of Yah-Who-Wah our ELL-Low-Heem and fear because of You.<br>
18 Who is an ELL-Low-Heem like You  --  taking away crookedness and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance? He shall not retain His wrath forever, for He Himself delights in loving-commitment.<br>
19 He shall turn back, He shall have compassion on us, He shall trample upon our crookednesses! And You throw all our sins into the depths of the sea!<br>
20 You give truth to Yah-Coab, loving-commitment to Ah-Vrah-Hahm, which You swore to our fathers from the days of old!<br>

Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what it MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

Revelation 15: 2-5 KJV<br>
15:2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.<br>
15:3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.<br>
15:4 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgements are made manifest.<br>
15:5 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:<br>
<br>
Revelation 15: 2-5 NLT<br>
2 I saw before me what seemed to be a glass sea mixed with fire. And on it stood all the people who had been victorious over the beast and his statue and the number representing his name. They were all holding harps that God had given them.<br>
3 And they were singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb:<br>
"Great and marvellous are your works,<br>
O Lord God, the Almighty.<br>
Just and true are your ways,<br>
O King of the nations.<br>
(King of the ages.)<br>
<br>
4<br>
Who will not fear you, Lord,<br>
and glorify your name?<br>
For you alone are holy.<br>
All nations will come and worship before you,<br>
for your righteous deeds have been revealed."<br>
5 Then I looked and saw that the Temple in heaven, God's Tabernacle, was thrown wide open.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 15: 2-5 TS2009<br>
2 And I saw like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those overcoming the beast and his image and his mark and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
3 And they sing the song of Moe-Shay the servant of ELL-Low-Heem, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvellous are Your works, Yaw-Who-Wah ELL Shuh-Dye! Righteous and true are Your ways, O Sovereign of the set-apart ones!<br>
4 "Who shall not fear You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, and esteem Your Name? Because You alone are kind. Because all nations shall come and worship before You, for Your righteousnesses have been made manifest."<br>
5 And after this I looked and saw the Dwelling Place of the Tent of Witness in the heaven was opened.<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ten Per Cent<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's start with a quick review of some Scripture.<br>
<br>
Romans 12:2 (KJV)<br>
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 12:2 (NLT)<br>
Don't copy the behaviour and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 2:8 (KJV)<br>
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.<br>
<br>
Colossians 2:8 (NLT)<br>
Don't let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense that come from human thinking (and from the spiritual principles of this world,) and from the spiritual powers of this world, rather than from Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 15:24 KJV<br>
And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 15:24 NLT<br>
Then Saul admitted to Samuel, "Yes, I have sinned. I have disobeyed your instructions and the Lord's command, for I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded.<br>
<br>
Let's recall again a snip of a Commentary from a study, titled, Better Than Sacrifice,<br>
which was back in Christian Essays 20...<br>
Commentary:<br>
Why did King Saul disobey the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah?<br>
King Saul tells us why, in Verse 24.<br>
I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.<br>
I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded.<br>
Are we talking about King Saul, or are we talking about Christian Church Services on Sunday?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 1:14 (NLT)<br>
They must stop listening to Jewish myths and the commands of people who have turned away from the truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is something that was looked at, back when we did the Bible study,<br>
titled, Doctrine,<br>
which was back in Christian Essays 16,<br>
also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 16.<br>
Let's look at this little bit, again...<br>
<br>
Isaiah 29: verse 13 KJV of the Hebrew Version:<br>
...their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 29: verse 13 NLT of the Hebrew Version:<br>
...their worship of me<br>
is nothing but man-made rules learned by rote.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 29: verse 13 NLT of the Greek Version:<br>
Their worship is a farce,<br>
for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 29: verses 12 & 13, the Greek version also gets quoted in the book of Mark 7.<br>
<br>
Here in Mark 7, Jesus is talking to some Pharisees and teachers of religious law<br>
about Inner Purity...<br>
<br>
Mark 7: 8 & 9 (NLT)<br>
8 For you ignore God's law and substitute your own tradition."<br>
9 Then he said, "You skilfully sidestep God's law in order to hold on to your own tradition.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 7: 6-9 (KJV)<br>
6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.<br>
7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<br>
8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.<br>
9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 7: 6-9 -- NLT<br>
6 Jesus replied, "You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, for he wrote,<br>
'These people honour me with their lips,<br>
but their hearts are far from me.<br>
7<br>
Their worship is a farce,<br>
for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.'<br>
8 For you ignore God's law and substitute your own tradition."<br>
9 Then he said, "You skilfully sidestep God's law in order to hold on to your own tradition.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Many pastors of many churches and mega-churches may have, at one time or another,<br>
said something to this effect...<br>
<br>
The brothers are now going to come forward and collect the tithes and offerings.<br>
The first ten per cent of your income belongs to God.<br>
You are to give the first 10% of your income to the church.<br>
Any donation amount above that first 10% is optional, and that it known as an offering.<br>
You can choose to take the offering and have it designated to go towards a particular area of the church,<br>
or have it go towards a mission or a certain ministry of the church, if you want to, or you can leave that choice up to the church,<br>
based on where we have the greatest need.<br>
<br>
<br>
That might sound good, but is it really true?<br>
<br>
When someone says something that sounds true and good, we can search it out in the Bible, and we will likely come to one of three possible conclusions...<br>
1. It matches what the Bible says, and so it is true. Bible verses say it and support it and agree with what was said.<br>
2. It is not found in the Bible, which may indicate that it may not be true, and may, most likely be not true.<br>
3. the Bible says the opposite of that,<br>
there are Bible verses that say the opposite of that, and they are in direct opposition to what someone said,<br>
and so what that person said is absolutely not true, indicating that the person is a liar and an anti-christ.<br>
Or, maybe they are just making it all up, and they don't really care if it's true or not.<br>
They might just be making it up so that they can take your money.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, is this tithing to the church message true or not true?<br>
Let's find out here in just a moment.<br>
<br>
Tithing mainly had to do with the Temple of God.<br>
Where is this temple?<br>
The temple used to be right next to the spot where we see today a yellow building with a yellow dome roof.<br>
Since tithing is strongly associated with the temple, let's first consider something in Revelation 11.<br>
Whilst we are here in this chapter 11, let's also study the information about the two witnesses, and the end times,<br>
and then we will go back to our study about tithes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 10:11 (KJV) -- the last verse at the end of Chapter 10,<br>
and we keep on reading right into most of Chapter 11,<br>
stopping when we get to<br>
Revelation 11:14 (KJV)<br>
We now begin at Revelation 10:11 (KJV)<br>
10:11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.<br>
11:1 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.<br>
<br>
(But the court which is without the temple cast out, and measure it not;)<br>
11:2 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.<br>
<br>
(I will give unto my two witnesses that they may prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days)<br>
11:3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.<br>
11:4 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.<br>
11:5 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.<br>
11:6 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.<br>
11:7 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.<br>
11:8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.<br>
11:9 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.<br>
11:10 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.<br>
11:11 And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.<br>
11:12 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.<br>
11:13 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell,<br>
(and in the earthquake were slain names of men seven thousand)<br>
and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.<br>
11:14 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 10:11 (NLT) -- the last verse at the end of Chapter 10,<br>
and we keep on reading right into most of Chapter 11,<br>
stopping again when we get to<br>
Revelation 11:14 (NLT)<br>
11 Then I was told, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."<br>
1 Then I was given a measuring stick, and I was told, "Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the number of worshippers.<br>
2 But do not measure the outer courtyard, for it has been turned over to the nations. They will trample the holy city for 42 months.<br>
3 And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will be clothed in burlap and will prophesy during those 1,260 days."<br>
4 These two prophets are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of all the earth.<br>
5 If anyone tries to harm them, fire flashes from their mouths and consumes their enemies. This is how anyone who tries to harm them must die.<br>
6 They have power to shut the sky so that no rain will fall for as long as they prophesy. And they have the power to turn the rivers and oceans into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish.<br>
<br>
(When they complete their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss, or, the underworld, will declare war against them,)<br>
7 When they complete their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the bottomless pit will declare war against them, and he will conquer them and kill them.<br>
8 And their bodies will lie in the main street of (the great city) Jerusalem, the city that is figuratively called "Sodom" and "Egypt," the city where their Lord was crucified.<br>
9 And for three and a half days, all peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will stare at their bodies. No one will be allowed to bury them.<br>
10 All the people who belong to this world will gloat over them and give presents to each other to celebrate the death of the two prophets who had tormented them.<br>
11 But after three and a half days, God breathed life into them, and they stood up! Terror struck all who were staring at them.<br>
12 Then a loud voice from heaven called to the two prophets, "Come up here!" And they rose to heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched.<br>
13 At the same time there was a terrible earthquake that destroyed a tenth of the city. Seven thousand people died in that earthquake, and everyone else was terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.<br>
14 The second terror is past, but look, the third terror is coming quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What brought us here was the measuring of the temple in Revelation 11:2.<br>
<br>
Revelation 11:2 (KJV)<br>
But the court which is without the temple (cast out and) leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.<br>
<br>
That word there, that says, Gentiles...<br>
Gentiles are<br>
the nations, heathen world,<br>
foreign (non-Jewish, usually, by implication, pagan)<br>
<br>
Commentary: If we go to the place known today as the Temple Mount, and measure the area, we do not measure the area given unto the Gentiles.<br>
At this area today sits a yellow building with a big yellow dome on its roof.<br>
We could thus say that the yellow building is heathen, foreign, non-Jewish, and pagan.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's now go to the very popular verse that talks about tithes.<br>
<br>
Malachi 3:10 (KJV)<br>
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.<br>
<br>
What are tithes, and what is a storehouse?<br>
<br>
Let's take a quick look at these words, using our usual reference materials, which, of course, includes the Strong's concordance.<br>
<br>
tithes<br>
a tenth, a tenth part, payment of a tenth part, which would be ten per cent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
storehouse<br>
a depository<br>
an armoury, cellar, garner, the store (store-house), the treasure (treasure-house), treasury<br>
store<br>
supplies of food or drink<br>
magazine of weapons, God's armoury<br>
Can also be used to talk about storehouses of God, where the rain, snow, hail, the wind, and the sea are stored.<br>
May also be known as chambers in the book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
and the Hebrew word that gets translated into meat, is a word that generally refers to prey, food, and leaf.<br>
So, that can mean, prey as in animals caught and stored for food, food in general, including bread, seeds and grains, and foods harvested from plants and trees that have leaves on them, like fruits and vegetables, nuts and herbs and such.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Malachi 2:17 (KJV) - The last verse at the end of Chapter 2<br>
and we keep reading into Chapter 3, until we get to<br>
Malachi 3:12 (KJV)<br>
2:17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgement?<br>
3:1 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
3:2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:<br>
3:3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.<br>
3:4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former (ancient) years.<br>
3:5 And I will come near to you to judgement; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress (or defraud) the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
3:6 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.<br>
3:7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?<br>
3:8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.<br>
3:9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.<br>
3:10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, (and empty out a blessing) and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.<br>
3:11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground (or corrupt the fruits of your ground); neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
3:12 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Malachi 2:17 (NLT) - The last verse at the end of Chapter 2<br>
and we keep reading into Chapter 3, until we get to<br>
Malachi 3:12 (NLT)<br>
17 You have wearied the Lord with your words.<br>
"How have we wearied him?" you ask.<br>
You have wearied him by saying that all who do evil are good in the Lord's sight, and he is pleased with them. You have wearied him by asking, "Where is the God of justice?"<br>
1 "Look! I am sending my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. Then the Lord you are seeking will suddenly come to his Temple. The messenger of the covenant, whom you look for so eagerly, is surely coming," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
2 "But who will be able to endure it when he comes? Who will be able to stand and face him when he appears? For he will be like a blazing fire that refines metal, or like a strong soap that bleaches clothes.<br>
3 He will sit like a refiner of silver, burning away the dross. He will purify the Levites, refining them like gold and silver, so that they may once again offer acceptable sacrifices to the Lord.<br>
4 Then once more the Lord will accept the offerings brought to him by the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as he did in the past.<br>
5 "At that time I will put you on trial. I am eager to witness against all sorcerers and adulterers and liars. I will speak against those who cheat employees of their wages, who oppress widows and orphans, or who deprive the foreigners living amongst you of justice, for these people do not fear me," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
6 "I am the Lord, and I do not change. That is why you descendants of Jacob are not already destroyed.<br>
7 Ever since the days of your ancestors, you have scorned my decrees and failed to obey them. Now return to me, and I will return to you," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
"But you ask, 'How can we return when we have never gone away?'<br>
8<br>
"Should people cheat God? Yet you have cheated me!<br>
"But you ask, 'What do you mean? When did we ever cheat you?'<br>
"You have cheated me of the tithes and offerings due to me.<br>
9<br>
You are under a curse, for your whole nation has been cheating me.<br>
10 Bring all the tithes into the storehouse so there will be enough food in my Temple. If you do," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies, "I will open the windows of heaven for you. I will pour out a blessing so great you won't have enough room to take it in! Try it! Put me to the test!<br>
11 Your crops will be abundant, for I will guard them from insects and disease.<br>
(Your crops will be abundant, for I will guard them from the devourer.)<br>
Your grapes will not fall from the vine before they are ripe," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
12 "Then all nations will call you blessed, for your land will be such a delight," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
<br>

Malachi 2:17 is pointing to a kind of message, a false message, that churches preach even to this day...<br>
<br>
Malachi 2:17 (NLT)<br>
You have wearied the Lord with your words. "How have we wearied him?" you ask. You have wearied him by saying that all who do evil are good in the Lord's sight, and he is pleased with them. You have wearied him by asking, "Where is the God of justice?"<br>
<br>
(Malachi) 2:17 (TS2009)<br>
You have wearied Yaw-Who-Wah with your words, and you have said, "In what way have we wearied Him?" In that you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the eyes of Yaw-Who-Wah, and He is delighting in them," or, "Where is the ELL-Low-Heem of right-ruling?"<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Many churches teach and preach that, Jesus Loves You, and just believe and have faith,<br>
but they refuse to teach that, having the Fear of the Lord means that you are to hate sin, not accept sin and tolerate sin.<br>
Many churches refuse to teach and preach about the need to repent, change direction, make a U-Turn with your life, and stop sinning.<br>
Many may also murmur and complain about all of the Satanic activities in the world, and all of the matters in the world that are unfair and unjust.<br>
We have wearied Yaw-Who-Wah with our attitudes and mindsets that creep in from these two issues.<br>
The two issues are,<br>
not teaching about repentance and commandment obedience, and<br>
questioning God's authority, questioning God's awareness and even His presence or actual existence because of the present-day Satanic activities, and the unfair injustices.<br>
The mask, the injections, the empty shelves at the store, the bills and the prices getting higher, and our wages getting lower, and on and on the list goes.<br>
Where is the God of justice? Asking that question, questioning Him like that, it wearies Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's now look at how tithing is something that is submitted to the temple...<br>
<br>
But they did not technically take it to the temple, they took it to the storehouse.<br>
Where is the storehouse, the treasuries?<br>
<br>
Here are some things that we may begin to see in the Bible verses that we are about to read...<br>
So, the first ten per cent of your income should be placed into storage.<br>
If you can't store it all, then sell it and save the money, as tithe money, and give the tithe money to the temple.<br>
Don't save the tithe money longer than three years, because the people that work in the temple depend on it.<br>
Is that something we should do today?<br>
Should we tithe?<br>
Yes. Leviticus 27 gives us the commandment to tithe.<br>
The commandment to tithe is given before the temple existed.<br>
These verses here tell us that the tithe belongs to the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah, but it does not say what to do with it, and it does not say to whom or to where it should be given or submitted to.<br>
The actual temple did not yet exist, other than a tent of meeting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 27: 30-34 (KJV)<br>
27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy unto the LORD.<br>
27:31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.<br>
27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.<br>
27:33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.<br>
27:34 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 27: 30-34 (NLT)<br>
30 "One-tenth of the produce of the land, whether grain from the fields or fruit from the trees, belongs to the Lord and must be set apart to him as holy.<br>
31 If you want to buy back the Lord's tenth of the grain or fruit, you must pay its value, plus 20 per cent.<br>
32 Count off every tenth animal from your herds and flocks and set them apart for the Lord as holy.<br>
33 You may not pick and choose between good and bad animals, and you may not substitute one for another. But if you do exchange one animal for another, then both the original animal and its substitute will be considered holy and cannot be bought back."<br>
34 These are the commands that the Lord gave through Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Deuteronomy 15, the temple also did not yet exist, other than there being a tent of meeting, or tabernacle.<br>
Again, we are given the commandment to tithe, but this time we have some information about what to do with it.<br>
It is to be taken to the location where the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah chooses.<br>
This place is a place that is holy, it is a place where He sets His Name there,<br>
it is a location that He has chosen and that He has blessed.<br>
Now, especially in the NLT, we will see something very interesting.<br>
You save the tithe, you put it into storage.<br>
You sell it and keep the money.  We will call it tithe money.<br>
You take the tithe money to the location where you will feast, and you spend the tithe money on yourself and your household, to buy food for you and your family, your household, to buy food for the feast.<br>
The Levites ran the tent of meeting, and helped do all the offerings and sacrifices, and later would operate the temple.<br>
Let's take a look at this right now in the book of Deuteronomy, in chapters 14 and 15.<br>
<br>
Let's start reading at Deuteronomy 14:21 (KJV)<br>
and we keep on reading into the next chapter,<br>
stopping when we get to Deuteronomy 15:11 (KJV)<br>
14:21 Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.<br>
14:22 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.<br>
14:23 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.<br>
14:24 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:<br>
14:25 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:<br>
<br>
14:26 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, (or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee:) or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,<br>
14:27 And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.<br>
14:28 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:<br>
14:29 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.<br>
15:1 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.<br>
<br>
15:2 And this is the manner of the release:<br>
(Every master of the lending of his hand unto his neighbour shall release it;)<br>
Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD'S release.<br>
15:3 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;<br>
(To the end that there be no poor amongst you)<br>
15:4 Save when there shall be no poor amongst you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:<br>
15:5 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.<br>
15:6 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.<br>
15:7 If there be amongst you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:<br>
15:8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.<br>
(Beware that there be not a word in thy Belial heart,)<br>
15:9 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.<br>
15:10 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.<br>
15:11 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's see what NLT does here.<br>
Again, we start reading at Deuteronomy 14:21 (NLT)<br>
and we keep on reading into the next chapter,<br>
stopping when we get to Deuteronomy 15:11 (NLT)<br>
21 "You must not eat anything that has died a natural death. You may give it to a foreigner living in your town, or you may sell it to a stranger. But do not eat it yourselves, for you are set apart as holy to the Lord your God.<br>
"You must not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.<br>
22 "You must set aside a tithe of your crops -- one-tenth of all the crops you harvest each year.<br>
23 Bring this tithe to the designated place of worship -- the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honoured -- and eat it there in his presence. This applies to your tithes of grain, new wine, olive oil, and the firstborn males of your flocks and herds. Doing this will teach you always to fear the Lord your God.<br>
24 "Now when the Lord your God blesses you with a good harvest, the place of worship he chooses for his name to be honoured might be too far for you to bring the tithe.<br>
25 If so, you may sell the tithe portion of your crops and herds, put the money in a pouch, and go to the place the Lord your God has chosen.<br>
26 When you arrive, you may use the money to buy any kind of food you want -- cattle, sheep, goats, wine, or other alcoholic drink. Then feast there in the presence of the Lord your God and celebrate with your household.<br>
27 And do not neglect the Levites in your town, for they will receive no allotment of land amongst you.<br>
28 "At the end of every third year, bring the entire tithe of that year's harvest and store it in the nearest town.<br>
29 Give it to the Levites, who will receive no allotment of land amongst you, as well as to the foreigners living amongst you, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, so they can eat and be satisfied. Then the Lord your God will bless you in all your work.<br>
1 "At the end of every seventh year you must cancel the debts of everyone who owes you money.<br>
2 This is how it must be done. Everyone must cancel the loans they have made to their fellow Israelites. They must not demand payment from their neighbours or relatives, for the Lord's time of release has arrived.<br>
3 This release from debt, however, applies only to your fellow Israelites -- not to the foreigners living amongst you.<br>
4 "There should be no poor amongst you, for the Lord your God will greatly bless you in the land he is giving you as a special possession.<br>
5 You will receive this blessing if you are careful to obey all the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today.<br>
6 The Lord your God will bless you as he has promised. You will lend money to many nations but will never need to borrow. You will rule many nations, but they will not rule over you.<br>
7 "But if there are any poor Israelites in your towns when you arrive in the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted toward them.<br>
8 Instead, be generous and lend them whatever they need.<br>
9 Do not be mean-spirited and refuse someone a loan because the year for cancelling debts is close at hand. If you refuse to make the loan and the needy person cries out to the Lord, you will be considered guilty of sin.<br>
10 Give generously to the poor, not grudgingly, for the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.<br>
11 There will always be some in the land who are poor. That is why I am commanding you to share freely with the poor and with other Israelites in need.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, if we try to summarise all of that...<br>
Tithe.<br>
Save the tithe money for spending on food for one of the Lord's seven feasts, or when you gather together and feast together in a fellowship meal.<br>
When you gather together in a solemn assembly of fellow believers, use your tithe money to buy the food for your family.<br>
Give to the Levites.<br>
Give generously to the poor. None of the fellow believers should be poor. We have here a commandment that commands us to make sure none of the fellowship believers are poor.<br>
We will receive a blessing if we obey all of these commandments.<br>
We are to share and give to the poor, especially the fellowship believers.<br>
Any debt owed to a fellowship believer must be forgiven, cancelled, cleared, erased and deleted once the debt is more than seven years old.<br>
Every three years, all of the tithe is given to the Levites, and is also given to the foreigners living amongst you, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, so they can eat and be satisfied.<br>
So far, we do not see anything about giving this to a church.<br>
It goes to yourself and your family for having food for doing one of the Lord's feasts and fellowship meals.<br>
It is used to help the Levites, the poor, the foreigners living amongst you, the orphans, and the widows.<br>
Every three years the tithe of that year goes into some kind of local, community central storage facility or storehouse of some kind.<br>
From that central storage unit facility location, it is given to the Levites, the poor, the foreigners living amongst you, the orphans, and the widows.<br>
The foreigners? Those are the Gentiles, the heathen, the nations, the people living amongst you.<br>
That's everyone. All nations and people. Israel, non-Hebrew people, descendants of Abraham, those of foreign nations, the Gentiles.<br>
That Hebrew word being used right there can be used to identify all of those nations that we have just described.<br>
Since the Levites had the full time job of operating the tent of meeting, or tabernacle, and later, they operated and ran the temple building, they should also have tithe given to them, because that is their only source of income.<br>
They got their food from the tithe, the sacrifices and offerings brought to the temple.<br>
That's seems to be the part where we later get the idea of tithing to a church building, and the people that run the church building.<br>
But, as we can see, there is so much more to it than just that.<br>
<br>
Again, there was no temple building when this commandment to tithe was given.<br>
In the book of Malachi, he talks about a storehouse.<br>
We do see something in what we just read in the NLT...<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 14:28 (NLT)<br>
"At the end of every third year, bring the entire tithe of that year's harvest and store it in the nearest town.<br>
<br>
That would cause there to be a need of some kind of storehouse. That Hebrew word also gets translated into the word, Chamber.<br>
You may really see it be the word, chamber, in the book of Enoch, depending on which English translation you read.<br>
We really see the need of the tithe having a storehouse or storage building in 2 Chronicles.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the book of 2 Chronicles,<br>
we see moments when one king is disobedient, and another king decides to be obedient again,<br>
and there is this going back and forth between different kings.<br>
In chapter 28,<br>
Ahaz Rules in Judah, and he did not do what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, as his ancestor David had done.<br>
Ahaz Closes the Temple. Then, the next king,<br>
Hezekiah Rules in Judah, and he did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight, just as his ancestor David had done.<br>
Hezekiah Reopens the Temple in chapter 29, and we read in there about The Temple Rededication.<br>
They start doing the feasts again, and we see them doing the Celebration of Passover in chapter 30.<br>
and that brings us to chapter 31.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 31 is where we see them decide to go back to doing tithes again,<br>
and with such a large amount coming in, being piled in heaps,<br>
that they decide to build chambers, or storehouses, as a place for storage of the tithes.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 31: 2-14 (KJV)<br>
31:2 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.<br>
31:3 He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.<br>
31:4 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.<br>
(And as soon as the commandment brought forth, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and dates,)<br>
31:5 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.<br>
<br>
31:6 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.<br>
(The Hebrew wording at the end of verse 6 literally says, and laid them heaps heaps.)<br>
<br>
31:7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.<br>
31:8 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.<br>
31:9 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.<br>
31:10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.<br>
(Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare storehouses in the house of the LORD;)<br>
31:11 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,<br>
31:12 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.<br>
31:13 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.<br>
31:14 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We will again start reading at<br>
2 Chronicles 31:2 (NLT)<br>
and we keep reading this time until we get to the first verse of the next chapter.<br>
stopping at 2 Chronicles 32:1 (NLT)<br>
2 Hezekiah then organised the priests and Levites into divisions to offer the burnt offerings and peace offerings, and to worship and give thanks and praise to the Lord at the gates of the Temple.<br>
3 The king also made a personal contribution of animals for the daily morning and evening burnt offerings, the weekly Sabbath festivals, the monthly new moon festivals, and the annual festivals as prescribed in the Law of the Lord.<br>
4 In addition, he required the people in Jerusalem to bring a portion of their goods to the priests and Levites, so they could devote themselves fully to the Law of the Lord.<br>
5 When the people of Israel heard these requirements, they responded generously by bringing the first share of their grain, new wine, olive oil, honey, and all the produce of their fields. They brought a large quantity -- a tithe of all they produced.<br>
6 The people who had moved to Judah from Israel, and the people of Judah themselves, brought in the tithes of their cattle, sheep, and goats and a tithe of the things that had been dedicated to the Lord their God, and they piled them up in great heaps.<br>
7 They began piling them up in late spring, and the heaps continued to grow until early autumn.<br>
8 When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw these huge piles, they thanked the Lord and his people Israel!<br>
9 "Where did all this come from?" Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites.<br>
10 And Azariah the high priest, from the family of Zadok, replied, "Since the people began bringing their gifts to the Lord's Temple, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare. The Lord has blessed his people, and all this is left over."<br>
11 Hezekiah ordered that storerooms be prepared in the Temple of the Lord. When this was done,<br>
12 the people faithfully brought all the gifts, tithes, and other items dedicated for use in the Temple. Conaniah the Levite was put in charge, assisted by his brother Shimei.<br>
13 The supervisors under them were Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath, and Benaiah. These appointments were made by King Hezekiah and Azariah, the chief official in the Temple of God.<br>
14 Kore son of Imnah the Levite, who was the gatekeeper at the East Gate, was put in charge of distributing the voluntary offerings given to God, the gifts, and the things that had been dedicated to the Lord.<br>
15 His faithful assistants were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah. They distributed the gifts amongst the families of priests in their towns by their divisions, dividing the gifts fairly amongst old and young alike.<br>
16 They distributed the gifts to all males three years old or older, regardless of their place in the genealogical records. The distribution went to all who would come to the Lord's Temple to perform their daily duties according to their divisions.<br>
17 They distributed gifts to the priests who were listed by their families in the genealogical records, and to the Levites twenty years old or older who were listed according to their jobs and their divisions.<br>
18 Food allotments were also given to the families of all those listed in the genealogical records, including their little babies, wives, sons, and daughters. For they had all been faithful in purifying themselves.<br>
19 As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who were living in the open villages around the towns, men were appointed by name to distribute portions to every male amongst the priests and to all the Levites listed in the genealogical records.<br>
20 In this way, King Hezekiah handled the distribution throughout all Judah, doing what was pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord his God.<br>
21 In all that he did in the service of the Temple of God and in his efforts to follow God's laws and commands, Hezekiah sought his God wholeheartedly. As a result, he was very successful.<br>
1 After Hezekiah had faithfully carried out this work, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified towns, giving orders for his army to break through their walls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Here is another example of bad stuff happening to people even when they did not do anything wrong.<br>
King Hezekiah tries to do his very best to follow God's laws and commands, doing what was pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord his God.<br>
Hezekiah sought his God wholeheartedly. As a result, he was very successful.<br>
And with all of that good going on, as soon as we go the very next chapter, instant war and trouble, as Assyria Invades Judah.<br>
<br>
Well, the story goes on from there, in this book, and in other books in your Bible, and in books that are not in your Bible. However, you can at least see that, even when you do all of this Bible stuff perfectly right, it does not guarantee that everything will be good and easy all the time. There is no guarantee about how long the times and seasons last. It is false to think that it only gets better and better every day. Sometimes it does seem better for a while, but then, sometimes it does not.<br>
<br>
The Bible clearly indicates, in many places, that, some days of trouble, stress, and spiritual battles of one kind or another, will come along, even if you try your best to do and obey the commandments in your Bible. Why?  For now, this is the wrong floor. Do you ever step into a lift or an elevator, you get in, you push a button, you wait, you stand there, you wait, and then the door opens, you get out, and after the door closes, you realise, that you are on the wrong floor?  Does your entire life feel like that? We are a strange and peculiar people. We are in the world, but we are not of this world. This is not my home, at least, not yet.<br>
<br>
Someday, Yaw-Who-Wah will take all that is wrong, and He will make it right and perfect, with a new heaven, a new earth, and a perfect kingdom, called, the New Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
But, in the meanwhile, for now, again I say that there will be some days of trouble, stress and battles of one kind or another. Those kinds of days will happen, even if you try your best to do and obey the commandments in your Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even King Hezekiah, great as he was, makes a stupid mistake later on in life, giving a prideful, grand tour of all his riches to some Babylon spies, showing the spies why it would be really good for them to attack and invade his land.<br>
The spies called themselves, ambassadors.<br>
There are other books in your Bible that tell this story in greater detail.<br>
There are some other books that are not in your Bible anymore that also provide details about the story of King Hezekiah, including some material that King Hezekiah wrote himself.<br>
We can get a quick, little snip about this story in the book of 2 Chronicles.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 32: 24 & 25 (NLT)<br>
24 ...Hezekiah became deathly ill. He prayed to the Lord, who healed him and gave him a miraculous sign.<br>
25 But Hezekiah did not respond appropriately to the kindness shown him, and he became proud. So the Lord's anger came against him and against Judah and Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 32:31 (NLT)<br>
...when ambassadors arrived from Babylon to ask about the remarkable events that had taken place in the land, God withdrew from Hezekiah in order to test him and to see what was really in his heart.<br>
<br>
And guess what nation shows up later to invade Judah? Babylon. What a surprise.<br>
<br>
Let's now go back to our study about tithes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Here is another Summary of some more things that we have learnt so far.<br>
Looking at all of this, and trying to ascertain the heart of the Lord in all of this.<br>
Tithe. Yes, we Tithe.<br>
Tithe first, and he will show you later where to send or submit the tithe.<br>
Put it in storage.<br>
If there is too much to store, sell it and save the money.<br>
(I would recommend not keeping it in a bank, and not keeping it stored in an electronic form, but it should be a physical form of money that you can save and touch and physically possess and control without the need for electricity or some kind of internet connection.)<br>
(If the electricity goes down, and your phone stops working, and there is no internet service, can you still access and touch and use your money?)<br>
The Lord will show you when and where to submit and give the tithe.<br>
Do not keep the tithe longer than three years.<br>
Every three years the tithe was gathered into a central storage facility.<br>
Again, tithe is given to the Levites, the poor, the foreigners living amongst you, the orphans, and the widows.<br>
Tithe money is for you to use to buy food for the the Lord's feasts and fellowship meals, when fellowship believers gather together and feast together, whether or not it is or is not one of the seven feasts.<br>
Tithe and Tithe money is especially used to help support those that run and operate the gathering place that the Lord has chosen for his people to gather at.<br>
If a believer owes you a debt, forgive and release the debt after seven years.<br>
With everyone doing the tithe and debt forgiveness, there should not be anyone poor amongst the believers.<br>
Some people say that the tithe was only for the temple, and the temple no longer exists, but that is not what we just saw in the scriptures.<br>
Let's think about this temple building, what it was, what happened to the building, and would be the "temple" today.<br>
If your own body is the temple, and the body of believers is the temple, we should still tithe to this temple as it is today.<br>
You are the temple today. We are. The group of believers gathering together in a solemn assembly is the body, and the body is the temple today.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 13:2 (NLT)<br>
Jesus replied, "Yes, look at these great buildings. But they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!"<br>
<br>
Luke 21:6 (NLT)<br>
"The time is coming when all these things will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!"<br>
<br>
Matthew 24:2 (NLT)<br>
But he responded, "Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!"<br>
<br>
At the website, Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, let's gather some information about the Temple Mount.<br>
Here are some selected details, all being quoted from this webpage...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount</a><br>
<br>
Here are some things that were found on that webpage, back in October 2022.<br>
<br>
The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism.<br>
According to Jewish tradition and scripture, the First Temple was built by King Solomon, the son of King David, in 957 BC,<br>
and was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BC.<br>
As no scientific excavations have ever been conducted on the site, no archaeological evidence has been found to verify this.<br>
The Second Temple was constructed under the auspices of Zerubbabel in 516 BC,<br>
was renovated by King Herod, and was destroyed by the Roman Empire in 70 AD.<br>
Orthodox Jewish tradition maintains it is here that the third and final Temple will be built when the Messiah comes.<br>
The Temple Mount is the place Jews turn towards during prayer.<br>
Jewish attitudes towards entering the site vary. Due to its extreme sanctity, many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself,<br>
to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the Holy of Holies stood, since, according to (not in the Bible) rabbinical law, there is still some aspect of the divine presence at the site.<br>
<br>
In October 2022, there was also found some commentary from a sermon by Ray Stedman.<br>
<br>
Ray Stedman was born in the year 1917, and he passed away in 1992.<br>
Ray Stedman was an evangelical Christian pastor, and author of several books.<br>
After working with J. Vernon McGee, he became a pastor in 1950, and went to<br>
The San Francisco Bay Area, to the city of Palo Alto, California,<br>
and it was there at Peninsula Bible Church, that Ray Stedman was a pastor there for 40 years.<br>
<br>
We will now read a selected portion from the Ray Stedman Ministries webpage as it was in October of 2022.<br>
The webpage was found at...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.raystedman.org/new-testament/matthew/the-long-look-ahead">https://www.raystedman.org/new-testament/matthew/the-long-look-ahead</a><br>
<br>
From the series, What on Earth's Going To Happen, Olivet Discourse,<br>
This quoted material is from the sermon, titled, The Long Look Ahead.<br>
Ray C. Stedman is the author of this Message transcript and recording<br>
that was first published on 01 January 1970.<br>
And is made available on the webpage mentioned previously,<br>
by Ray Stedman Ministries,<br>
<br>
Here is a quotation from this Message transcript...<br>
(Some Dictionary word definitions are inserted in round brackets.)
<br>
So Jesus predicts the downfall of the Temple in the near future as a sign that all else he includes in this discourse is true. This is what lay behind the request of the disciples for a sign associated with his coming.<br>
<br>
In Luke 21:20, we have other details of this predicted overthrow of the city and the Temple.<br>
There Jesus adds, "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near." Forty years later, the Roman armies under Titus came in and fulfilled the prediction to the very letter.<br>
With Titus was a Jewish historian named Josephus who recorded the terrible story in minute detail.<br>
It was one of the most ghastly sieges in all history.<br>
When the Romans came the city was divided amongst three warring factions of Jews, who were so at each others' throats that they paid no heed to the approach of the Romans.<br>
Thus, Titus came up and surrounded the city whilst it was distracted by its own internecine warfare.<br>
(They were too distracted fighting amongst themselves to notice the attack.)<br>
The Romans assaulted the walls again and again, and gave every opportunity to the Jews to surrender and save their capital destruction.<br>
<br>
During the long siege a terrible famine raged in the city and the bodies of the inhabitants of the city were literally stacked like cordwood in the streets.<br>
Mothers ate their own children to preserve their own strength. The toll of Jewish suffering was horrible but they would not surrender the city.<br>
Again and again they attempted to trick the Romans through guile and perfidy (disloyalty, betraying the Romans). When at last the walls were breached Titus tried to preserve the Temple by giving orders to his soldiers not to destroy or burn it.<br>
But the anger of the soldiers against the Jews was so intense that, maddened by the resistance they encountered, they disobeyed the order of their general and set fire to the temple. There were great quantities of gold and silver which had been placed in the Temple for safekeeping.<br>
This melted and ran down between the rocks and into the cracks of the stones that formed the Temple and the wall around it. When the Roman soldiers finally took the city, in their greed to obtain this gold and silver, they took long bars and pried apart these massive stones.<br>
Thus, quite literally, not one stone was left standing upon another. The Temple itself was totally destroyed though the wall supporting the area upon which the Temple was built was left partially intact and a portion of it remains to this day, called the Western Wall.<br>
<br>
And that is the end of the words quoted from the 1970 Message transcript, The Long Look Ahead, by Ray Stedman Ministries.<br>
<br>
Commentary: This quote points a book written by Josephus.<br>
Josephus is mainly known for writing two books. One is titled, The Jewish War, published in the year 75 AD, and the other book is titled, Antiquities of the Jews, published in the year 93 or 94 AD.<br>
There is an argument about the factual truthfulness of this story, about the gold melting into the stones making them want to literally disassemble the temple so completly so that not one stone was not left on top of another.<br>
Some who have tried to verify this and research this out, by finding physical evidence or other solid historical documentation,<br>
have concluded that there is no solid evidence or historical documented facts that can verify or prove all of the details that Ray Stedman describes to us here in his 1970 sermon.<br>
It's an interesting story, but we can't really seem to prove if these details are really historically true.<br>
<br>
The fact is this:<br>
The temple was destroyed by the Roman Empire in the year 70 AD.<br>
<br>
The commandment to tithe was to submit your tithe to the temple?<br>
The temple was destroyed in the the year 70 AD, and was never rebuilt.<br>
So, you cannot send your tithe to the temple, and the temple's storehouse, in Jerusalem, because it does not exist anymore.<br>
The temple and its storehouse did exist when the book of Malachi was written.<br>
<br>
Malachi does not say to tithe to the temple; he said, storehouse.<br>
So, the concept of tithing and storing the tithe in some kind of storage facility, storage room, storage unit, storage building, storage house or storehouse, is seen there in the book of Malachi,<br>
but it does not say where or which one.<br>
It does not say that it was only for the temple in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Back in 2 Chronicles 31, we saw, in the KJV and in the NLT, that the king had them do this...<br>
<br>
prepare chambers in the house of the LORD;<br>
prepare storehouses in the house of the LORD;<br>
storerooms be prepared in the Temple of the Lord.<br>
The Hebrew word that is being used there for house or Temple, that word can have a few different meanings.<br>
Let's insert those various meanings into the sentence.<br>
<br>
the house of the LORD Yaw-Who-Wah; can also be...<br>
<br>
the temple of the LORD;<br>
the body of the LORD;<br>
the place of the LORD;<br>
the family of the LORD;<br>
household, family<br>
those belonging to the same household<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 6:19 (KJV)<br>
What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 6:19 (NLT)<br>
Don't you realise that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself,<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3:16 (KJV)<br>
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3:16 (NLT)<br>
Don't you realise that all of you together are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God lives in you?<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2:21 (KJV)<br>
in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2:21 (NLT)<br>
We are carefully joined together in him, becoming a holy temple for the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The tithe is for the temple, and the temple still exists today. You are the temple! We are the temple! Your family of fellowship beleivers are all part of this temple that still exists today!<br>
The church body of fellowship believers is the temple. The Hebrew word for temple also means, house and family.<br>
Church body, church temple, church family, same thing.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 15:11 (KJV)<br>
...I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 15:11 (NLT)<br>
...I am commanding you to share freely with the poor and with other Israelites in need.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 15: 10 & 11 (NLT)<br>
10 Give generously to the poor, not grudgingly, for the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.<br>
11 There will always be some in the land who are poor. That is why I am commanding you to share freely with the poor and with other Israelites in need.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3: 27 & 28 (KJV)<br>
(Withhold not good from them the owners thereof, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.)<br>
3:27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.<br>
3:28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3: 27 & 28 (NLT)<br>
27<br>
Do not withhold good from those who deserve it<br>
when it's in your power to help them.<br>
28<br>
If you can help your neighbour now, don't say,<br>
"Come back tomorrow, and then I'll help you."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In conclusion, we can see that tithing is a commandment, and was not just for one certain temple in one certain city, a temple that no longer exists.<br>
The tithe was for us, to buy us food to eat at our next time of gathering together, at the gathering location that Yaw-Who-Wah chooses, where He has us gather together and have a feast together, whether just another weekly gathering, or one of the seven feasts.<br>
<br>
<br>
First priority is to make sure the tithe goes to those that work or volunteer to help at the gathering location.<br>
Make sure that their needs are being met.<br>
How can you know what someone's needs are, if you don't make the effort to communicate with them?<br>
How can other people know about your needs if you don't make the effort to communicate those needs to others?<br>
How can I pray for you, if you do not take the time to honestly communicate and fellowship with me?<br>
How can you pray for me, if I do not take the time, spending time with you, to honestly communicate and fellowship with you?<br>
Do you think that the definition of the assembling of ourselves together, gathering together as a group of believers, is simply making or watching videos, and sending text messages back and forth?<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:25 (KJV)<br>
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together...<br>
<br>
It can not be just a coincidence that the command to tithe is right next to the commandment to give generously in order to make sure that no one is allowed to be poor amongst the fellowship of believers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bring this tithe to the designated place of worship -- the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honoured.<br>
Use your tithe money to buy food to eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there.<br>
Go to the place the Lord your God has chosen.<br>
<br>
Again, the storehouse is<br>
your own personal storage unit or storage room, or, a storeroom or storage room placed inside the place where the fellowship believers gather together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Churches never want to teach you the secret of how to fellowship because the churches would not get your money if you knew how to fellowship without them.<br>
Fellowship requires communication between believers and those believers sharing their needs.<br>
We need to communicate our list of needs so that we know how to share and help those who have need.<br>
<br>
The Book of Acts, the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 2: verses 44 and 45 (NLT)<br>
44 And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had.<br>
45 They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Could you imagine the pastor of a mega-church ever making this announcement?<br>
I have decided to sell my home and live in a spare room in the back of the church, using all of that money from selling my house, to help those of you in need, to help you pay your rent and your bills, so you don't have to be without food and heat, and so you don't have to be evicted and homeless and hungry.<br>
We have decided to sell our family campground beach property and use all of that money to help those of you in need, to help you pay your rent and your bills, so you don't have to be without food and heat, and so you don't have to be evicted and homeless and hungry.<br>
We have decided to take half of our empty car park, our parking lot, which is bigger than the car park or parking lot at the shopping mall, and sell half of that land, and use all of that money to help those of you in need, to help you pay your rent and your bills, so you don't have to be without food and heat, and so you don't have to be evicted and homeless and hungry.<br>
<br>
What do we see instead?  Pastors demanding to buy their own private jet.<br>
<br>
Pastors travelling around, blowing their money on airfare, plane tickets, hiring cars, car rentals, taxis, expensive restaurants, hotels, travelling around, filling their car with petrol or gasoline, whilst the people going to their church find out what it's like to sleep in their car each night.<br>
<br>
I am not making this up! In 2018 and 2019, it was in the news that televangelist, Kenneth Copeland must have a fifty-four million dollar private jet, and Jesse Duplantis needed four of those jets, to do their job as a pastor.<br>
$54 million dollars multiplied five times or more.<br>
In October of 2022, that would be almost £49 million British pounds. Times that by five.<br>
That comes to $270 million dollars, or £245 million pounds.<br>
How many meals would that buy? How many hungry, homeless children have those private jets flown over since 2018?<br>
<br>
The tithe does not go into a basket, it does not go into a carpet bag, or cloth sack, it does not go into a pretty metal dish or a wooden tray, it does not go into a box,<br>
it goes to a person or it goes into a storehouse or storage room.<br>
The tithe is used to buy food for yourself and your family to eat at the next fellowship gathering assembly location.<br>
It is used to buy food to share and give to others at the next feast or fellowship gathering assembly location.<br>
The people that run, operate and maintain the fellowship gathering assembly location need the giving of tithes.<br>
The poor, the hungry, the widows and the orphans need the giving of tithes.<br>
Should you use the tithe for yourself, your family, another person, or put it into a storehouse?<br>
May the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah give us direction and wisdom on how to properly direct the tithe to the person or place where He tells us to send it, according to His perfect will.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 9:7 (KJV)<br>
Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.<br>
<br>
We consult once again our usual reference materials, which mainly include...<br>
Strong's Greek Dictionary provided by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen from Michael Grier's e-text,<br>
Public Domain Greek-English lexicon by John Jeffrey Dodson (2010),<br>
Thayer's Lexicon prepared by Alan Bunning, from the Centre for New Testament Restoration,<br>
and the Tyndale Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Greek - from Tyndale House, in Cambridge.<br>
<br>
in 2 Corinthians 9:7<br>
the Greek word for, cheerful, is pronounced, EE-Lad-Dose<br>
according to those reference materials, EE-Lad-Dose, means,<br>
cheerful, merry, joyous<br>
propitious or merry<br>
hilarious<br>
prompt or willing<br>
prompt to do anything<br>
<br>
Commentary: What is a so-called, cheerful giver?<br>
When you give, you are so happy to give that you almost want to laugh when you do!<br>
Be a hilarious giver, giving joyfully as you do.<br>
If we look at our usual dictionaries, which we did back in August of 2023, and combine their word definitions for the word, Prompt,<br>
Prompt means that you do give like this...<br>
immediate; quick; punctual<br>
instantly willing; ready<br>
unhesitating<br>
done quickly and without delay<br>
acting quickly or arriving at the arranged time<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Do not tithe and do not give unless you feel cheerful about doing so,<br>
and you feel so cheerful that you might feel hilarious, almost doing so with laughing,<br>
because you are so happy to be able to give,<br>
and you do it promptly, quickly and without delay or hesitation.<br>
If you feel the opposite of this way as described, grudgingly, then do not tithe and do not give<br>
because your heart is not right and your words may misrepresent the Heavenly Father<br>
and his only begotten Son in your wrong attitude.<br>
<br>
<br>
Our usual dictionaries that we were using back in August of 2023 were the<br>
Chambers, Cambridge, Collins, and Oxford dictionaries.<br>
(The Longman Dictionary website was malfunctioning on the day of our visit, and was not included.)<br>
<br>
Let's combine the word definitions for the word, grudging...<br>
grudging means,<br>
resentful, unwilling<br>
<br>
If you have or bear a grudge against someone, you have unfriendly feelings towards them because of something they did in the past.<br>
Grudging means, a persistent feeling of resentment, especially one due to some cause, such as an insult or injury,<br>
to give or allow unwillingly<br>
to feel resentful or envious about (someone else's success, possessions, etc)<br>
from the Old French word, grouchier, which means to grumble<br>
Giving grudgingly is when you give in a way that is given or done unwillingly.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 9: 6 & 7 (KJV)<br>
9:6 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.<br>
9:7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 9: 6-13 (NLT)<br>
6 Remember this -- a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop. But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop.<br>
7 You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure. "For God loves a person who gives cheerfully."<br>
8 And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others.<br>
9<br>
As the Scriptures say,<br>
"They share freely and give generously to the poor.<br>
Their good deeds will be remembered forever."<br>
(quoting from Psalms 112:9)<br>
10 For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat.<br>
In the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you.<br>
(In the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of righteousness in you.)<br>
<br>
11 Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous. And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God.<br>
12 So two good things will result from this ministry of giving --<br>
the needs of the believers in Jerusalem will be met,<br>
(the needs of God's holy people will be met,)<br>
and they will joyfully express their thanks to God.<br>
13 As a result of your ministry, they will give glory to God. For your generosity to them and to all believers will prove that you are obedient to the Good News of Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 9: 6-14 (TS2009)<br>
6 And this: He who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly, and he who sows on blessing shall also reap on blessing.<br>
7 Let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not of grief or of necessity, for ELL-Low-Heem loves a joyous giver.<br>
8 And ELL-Low-Heem is able to make all favour overflow toward you, that you, always having all you need in every way, have plenty for every good work.<br>
9 As it has been written, "He scattered abroad, He gave to the poor, His righteousness remains forever."<br>
(quoting from Psalms 112:9)<br>
10 And He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, shall supply and increase the seed you have sown and increase the fruit of your righteousness,<br>
11 being enriched in every way for all simplicity, which works out thanksgiving to ELL-Low-Heem through us.<br>
12 Because the rendering of this service not only supplies the needs of the set-apart ones, but also is overflowing through many thanksgivings to ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
13 Through the proof of this service, they esteem ELL-Low-Heem on the submission of your confession to the Good News of Messiah, and generosity in sharing with them and all men,<br>
14 and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the exceeding favour of ELL-Low-Heem in you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We will now end this study with a prayer. Let us pray.<br>
<br>
Dear Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, I confess that, in the past, I have not done tithing, and the thought of tithing was just not really on my mind. And, there are times even very recently when many of us are very poor, and it sounds fearful and scary to set aside ten per cent of our income to do this tithe.<br>
<br>
But you promise a blessing if we do tithe. Help us set aside the tithe and help us save and store the tithe, even if it only is used to help us buy our own food for the next time we gather together as a group of fellowship believers. May with learn to faithfully tithe, even if that fellowship is just my family, and our gathering together is just going to be this next Saturday Sabbath day of rest. May we save or give the tithe according to your directions and your perfect will. Cast out the fear of doing the tithe and the fear of obeying your commandments.  Enter into us and fill us with your Spirit that is Holy, so we can have the power and the ability to delightfully obey all of your commandments, all of your Torah, because you live inside of us, making our hearts your forever home.<br> 
<br>
Help us learn how to tithe, how to accomplish the definition of fellowship, how to pray for one another, how to actively and honestly communicate with one another, and help us generously give to one another, making sure that we help each other with our lists of needs. We will all have something to share and something to give if everyone in the fellowship were to obey this commandment to tithe and save and store the first ten per cent of our income, so that you can direct us on what to do with it, and, where it should go, and to whom it should go.<br>
<br>
Give us instruction, knowledge, direction and wisdom on saving and sharing the tithe, and to not be afraid about trusting in you and obeying your commandments.<br>
We thankfully receive your mercy, your grace and your forgiveness, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>
<br>

Leviticus 18: 1-5 (KJV)<br>
18:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
18:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.<br>
18:3 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.<br>
18:4 Ye shall do my judgements, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.<br>
18:5 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgements: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 18: 1-5 (NLT)<br>
1 Then the Lord said to Moses,<br>
2 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. I am the Lord your God.<br>
3 So do not act like the people in Egypt, where you used to live, or like the people of Canaan, where I am taking you. You must not imitate their way of life.<br>
4 You must obey all my regulations and be careful to obey my decrees, for I am the Lord your God.<br>
5 If you obey my decrees and my regulations, you will find life through them. I am the Lord.<br>

3 'Do not do as they do in the land of Meets-Rye-EEM, where you dwelt. And do not do as they do in the land of Kay-Nan, where I am bringing you, and do not walk in their laws.<br>
4 'Do My right-rulings and guard My laws, to walk in them. I am Yaw-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem.<br>

He said this when you were few in number,<br>
a tiny group of strangers in Canaan.<br>
20<br>
They wandered from nation to nation,<br>
from one kingdom to another.<br>
21<br>
Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.<br>
He warned kings on their behalf:<br>

"Do not touch my chosen people,<br>
and do not hurt my prophets."<br>

18 Saying, "To you I give the land of Kay-Nan, The portion of your inheritance,"<br>
19 When you were but few in number, Few indeed, and sojourners in it.<br>
20 And they went up and down, From one nation to another, And from one reign to another people.<br>
21 He allowed no one to oppress them, And He reproved sovereigns for their sakes, saying:<br>

Jeremiah 32: 38-41 (KJV)<br>
32:38 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:<br>

that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:<br>
32:40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them,<br>
(that I will not turn away from after them,)<br>
that I will not turn away from them,<br>
to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.<br>
<br>
32:41 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good,<br>

40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good for them. I will put a desire in their hearts to worship me, and they will never leave me.<br>
41 I will find joy doing good for them and will faithfully and wholeheartedly replant them in this land.<br>

40 And I shall make an everlasting covenant with them, that I do not turn back from doing good to them. And I shall put My fear in their hearts so as not to turn aside from Me.<br>
41 And I shall rejoice over them to do good to them, and shall plant them in this land in truth, with all My heart and with all My being.'<br>
42 "For thus said Yaw-Who-Wah, 'As I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I am bringing on them all the good that I am speaking to them.<br>

Isaiah 25: 4 & 5 (NLT)<br>
4<br>
But you are a tower of refuge to the poor, O Lord,<br>
a tower of refuge to the needy in distress.<br>
You are a refuge from the storm<br>
and a shelter from the heat.<br>
For the oppressive acts of ruthless people<br>
are like a storm beating against a wall,<br>
5<br>
or like the relentless heat of the desert.<br>
But you silence the roar of foreign nations.<br>
As the shade of a cloud cools relentless heat,<br>
so the boastful songs of ruthless people are stilled.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 25: 4 & 5 (TS2009)<br>
4 For You shall be a refuge to the poor, a refuge to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat. For the spirit of the ruthless is like a storm against a wall.<br>
5 You subdue the noise of foreigners, as heat in a dry place; as heat in the shadow of a cloud, the singing of the ruthless is subdued.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 25: 4 & 5 (KJV)<br>
25:4 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.<br>
25:5 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, in the KJV, verse 5 mentions the noise of strangers.<br>
Have you ever found some unfocused non-believers to be somewhat noisy in their meaningless conversations?<br>
<br>
<br>
The word, noise, is a French word, that comes from the Latin word, nausea, as what one feels when he or she has sea-sickness.<br>
<br>
Here are a few selected and interesting Definitions of the word, noise, being quoted from four different dictionaries.<br>
Here are some of the things that they said back in October of 2022...<br>
<br>
<br>
Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English<br>
a noise is a sound, especially one that is loud, unpleasant, or frightening;<br>
unwanted signals produced by an electrical circuit;<br>
pieces of unwanted information that can prevent a computer from working effectively.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chambers 21st Century Dictionary<br>
noise can sometimes be...<br>
interference in a signal,<br>
irrelevant or meaningless material appearing in output,<br>
to talk or complain a great deal.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary & Thesaurus...<br>
noise can also be known as unnecessary information or activity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Collins Cobuild Advanced Learner's Dictionary,<br>
and the Collins English Dictionary<br>
by HarperCollins Publishers...<br>
The Noise within an electric circuit are unwanted electrical signals.<br>
Noise refers to the unwanted parts of a situation, especially ones that make it more difficult for you to do or understand something.<br>
any undesired electrical disturbance in a circuit, degrading the useful information in a signal,<br>
undesired or irrelevant elements in a visual image,<br>
any unwanted electrical signal, especially within a communication system, that interferes with the sound or image being communicated.<br>

2 Corinthians 10: 3-6 (KJV)<br>
10:3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:<br>
(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God to the pulling down of strong holds;)<br>
10:4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)<br>
(Casting down reasonings,)<br>
10:5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;<br>
10:6 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.<br>
<br>
Here in 2 Corinthians 10, please note that English Bible translations divide verses 4 and 5 in various ways.<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 10: 3-5 (NLT)<br>
3 We are human, but we don't wage war as humans do.<br>
4 We use God's mighty weapons, not worldly weapons, to knock down the strongholds of human reasoning and to destroy false arguments.<br>
5 We destroy every proud obstacle that keeps people from knowing God. We capture their rebellious thoughts and teach them to obey Christ.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Could that mean that believers and followers might have some kind of spiritual noise cancellation?<br>
Is that truth and wisdom, or just meaningless noise? Does it have vanity or value? May Yaw-Who-Wah give us discernment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, moving on to something else random...<br>
The very short book of Obadiah mainly talks about Edom's Judgement being Announced, and the Reasons for Edom's Punishment.<br>
There is something interesting to think about, hiding there in verse 12...<br>
<br>
<br>
Obadiah 1:12 (KJV)<br>
(But do not behold the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have magnified thy mouth in the day of distress.)<br>
1:12 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.<br>
<br>
<br>
Obadiah 1:12 (NLT)<br>
"You should not have gloated<br>
when they exiled your relatives to distant lands.<br>
You should not have rejoiced<br>
when the people of Judah suffered such misfortune.<br>
You should not have spoken arrogantly<br>
in that terrible time of trouble.<br>
<br>
<br>
Obadiah 1:12 (TS2009)<br>
12 "And you should not have looked on your brother's day in the day of his estrangement, nor rejoiced over the children of Yeh-Who-Duh in the day of their destruction, nor made your mouth great in the day of distress,<br>
<br>
Commentary:  This reminds me of a little random verse that we looked at back in Christian Essays 8...<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24: 17 & 18 KJV<br>
17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:<br>
18 Lest the Lord see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.<br>
(Lest the Lord see it, and it be evil in his eyes, and he turn away his wrath from him.)<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24: 17 & 18 NLT<br>
17<br>
Don't rejoice when your enemies fall;<br>
don't be happy when they stumble.<br>
18<br>
For the Lord will be displeased with you<br>
and will turn his anger away from them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24: 17 & 18 NIV<br>
17<br>
Do not gloat when your enemy falls;<br>
when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice,<br>
18<br>
or the Lord will see and disapprove<br>
and turn his wrath away from them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24: 15 & 16 (NLT)<br>
15 Don't wait in ambush at the home of the godly, and don't raid the house where the godly live.<br>
16 The godly may trip seven times, but they will get up again. But one disaster is enough to overthrow the wicked.<br>

Proverbs 24: 14-20 (TS2009)<br>
14 Know that wisdom is thus to your being; If you have found it, there is a future, And your expectancy is not cut off.<br>
15 Do not lie in wait, O wrong one, Against the dwelling of the righteous; Do not ravage his resting place;<br>
16 For seven times a righteous man falls and rises, But the wrong one stumbles into evil.<br>
17 Do not exult when your enemy falls, And let not your heart rejoice when he stumbles;<br>
18 Lest Yaw-Who-Wah see and it be evil in His eyes, And He turn away His wrath from him.<br>
19 Do not fret because of evil-doers, And do not envy the wrong;<br>
20 For there is no future for the evil-doer; The lamp of the wrongdoers is put out.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 81:3 (KJV)<br>
Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, In the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The trumpet in Numbers 10 is not the same Hebrew word as the trumpet in Psalms 81:3.<br>
In Numbers 10, that English word for trumpet is an English translation from the Hebrew word,<br>
Hat-So-Sah-Raw.<br>
which is a trumpet or clarion.<br>
A clarion is an old kind of trumpet with a shrill sound, used to call men to arms.<br>
It may also be described as a high-pitched, small-bore trumpet.<br>
It was used as a communication device in battle, to transmit a very clear message or instruction about what action is needed.<br>
Trumpet and Bugle calls relayed commanders' orders on the battlefield, signalling the troops to Go Forward, To the Left, To the Right, About, Rally on the Chief, Trot, Gallop, Rise up, Lay down, Commence Firing, Cease Firing, Disperse, and other specific actions.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Psalms 81:3, that English word for trumpet is an English translation from the Hebrew word, Show-Far.<br>
This means, a cornet, a trumpet, a curved horn, or a ram's horn, giving a clear sound.<br>
A cornet is a musical instrument made from metal, usually brass, and is like a small trumpet.<br>
We're not talking about an ice cream cornet, which, in the United States, is known as an ice cream cone, which you may know is a soft thin biscuit, or a thin dry biscuit, shaped like a cone with scoops of ice cream held in it.<br>
<br>
In the Old Testament Hebrew,<br>
Hat-So-Sah-Raw is found 29 times, especially in 1st and 2nd Chronicles<br>
and is found only one time is Psalms, in Psalms 98:6.<br>
Show-Far is found 72 times.<br>
So, when you see the word, trumpet, in the Old Testament, chances are, it is more likely to be an English translation from the Hebrew word, Show-Far.<br>
<br>
Here are some more examples of some verses that mention a trumpet...<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 4:5 (KJV)<br>
Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.<br>
<br>
Joel 2:1 (KJV)<br>
Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;<br>
<br>
Psalms 150:3 (KJV)<br>
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: Praise him with the psaltery and harp.<br>
<br>
Nehemiah 4:20 (KJV)<br>
In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 33:5 (KJV)<br>
He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.<br>
<br>
Matthew 24:31 (KJV)<br>
And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.<br>
<br>
Joshua 6:20 (KJV)<br>
So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.<br>

<br>
Tenth Avenue North was an American contemporary Christian Music (CCM)<br>
band from West Palm Beach, Florida,<br>
that was active for about twenty-one years, from 2000 to 2021.<br>
<br>
The band released a total of fifteen original music projects,<br>
including eight full-length studio albums.<br>
<br>
Tenth Avenue North was founded in 2000<br>
by Mike Donehey, the lead singer,<br>
and Jason Jamison, the drummer.<br>
About eight other bandmates came and went during those 21 years.<br>
<br>
According to Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, in December of 2022,<br>
Mike Donehey said that the name, Tenth Avenue North was meant to be temporary because they were scheduled to play at a conference and could not agree on a name; they chose the name of the street they lived on in West Palm Beach and never changed it.<br>
<br>
They were famous for having the hit, "By Your Side",<br>
which was released in late August 2008 and<br>
eventually reached No. 1 on Christian contemporary hit radio in 2009.<br>
<br>
The Struggle is the name of the third studio album<br>
from the American contemporary Christian music band<br>
Tenth Avenue North. The Struggle was released on 21 August 2012<br>
and reached No. 1 on Billboard's Christian and rock charts.<br>
<br>
From this album is an interesting song, titled, Worn.<br>
It is spelled, W O R N.<br>
"Worn" was released as a single in 2013, with a music video.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
From their third album, The Struggle, here are the words to the 2012 song, "Worn,"<br>
by Tenth Avenue North.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm Tired I'm worn<br>
My heart is heavy<br>
From the work it takes<br>
to keep on breathing<br>
I've made mistakes<br>
I've let my hope fail<br>
My soul feels crushed<br>
by the weight of this world<br>
<br>
And I know that you can give me rest<br>
<br>
So I cry out with all that I have left<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me see redemption win<br>
Let me know the struggle ends<br>
That you can mend a heart<br>
that's frail and torn<br>
I wanna know the sun can rise<br>
from the ashes of a broken life<br>
And all that's dead inside<br>
can be reborn<br>
Cause I'm worn<br>
<br>
<br>
I know I need<br>
to lift my eyes up<br>
But I'm too weak<br>
Life just won't let up<br>
<br>
And I know that you can give me rest<br>
<br>
So I cry out with all that I have left<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me see redemption win<br>
Let me know the struggle ends<br>
That you can mend a heart<br>
that's frail and torn<br>
I wanna know a sun can rise from the ashes of a broken life<br>
And all that's dead inside<br>
can be reborn<br>
Cause I'm worn<br>
<br>
<br>
My prayers are wearing thin<br>
And I'm worn<br>
Even before the day begins<br>
<br>
Yeah, I'm worn<br>
I've lost my will to fight<br>
I'm worn<br>
So Heaven come and flood my eyes<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me see redemption win<br>
Let me know the struggle ends<br>
That you can mend a heart<br>
that's frail and torn<br>
I wanna know a sun can rise from the ashes of a broken life<br>
And all that's dead inside can be reborn<br>
Yes all that's dead inside will be reborn<br>
<br>
<br>
Though I'm worn<br>
Yeah I'm worn<br>
<br>

Back in December of 2022, there were a few webpages,<br>
at the website, Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia,<br>
that tell us about Christ Embassy<br>
(also known as LoveWorld Incorporated or Believers' Loveworld)<br>
The Christ Embassy LoveWorld Church is a megachurch and Christian denomination<br>
founded by Pastor Chris Oyakhilome in 1987.<br>
The Church, with the headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria,<br>
has since become a global network of churches,<br>
with congregations in many countries, and, back in December of 2022, they had<br>
approximately 13 million followers all over the world.<br>
The LoveWorld Church has ministries in Canada, Nigeria, South Africa,<br>
the United States and the United Kingdom,<br>
which is a total of 145 branches, in five continents.<br>
<br>
Osinachi Kalu Okoro Egbu<br>
known professionally as Sinach,<br>
is a Nigerian singer and songwriter,<br>
and was a senior worship leader at<br>
Christ Embassy<br>
(also known as LoveWorld Incorporated or Believers' Loveworld)<br>
and she was a senior worship leader there until 2021.<br>
<br>
Speaking on how she came by her stage name Sinach,<br>
she said: "I chose that from my name Osinachi<br>
because it is easy to pronounce and catchy".<br>
<br>
<br>
Sinach is most famous for her song, Way Maker.<br>
"Way Maker" is a contemporary worship song<br>
written by Nigerian gospel singer Sinach,<br>
and released as a single on 30 December 2015.<br>
The song has been covered by over 60 Christian music artists<br>
worldwide including Michael W. Smith, Mandisa, Leeland,<br>
Christafari, Passion, Darlene Zschech, Levistance and Bethel Music.<br>
<br>
Her song "Way Maker" received three nominations and<br>
won the Song of the Year at the 51st annual Gospel Music Association (GMA) Dove Awards,<br>
making her the first Nigerian to win the Award.<br>
<br>
The nominations were announced by the GMA on 13 August 2020.<br>
The awards show aired on the Trinity Broadcasting Network on Friday 30 October 2020.<br>
<br>
Interesting how a song that was released in 2015 did not win this Song of the Year award<br>
until 2020.<br>
<br>
<br>
As of December 2022, the videos for Way Maker<br>
are some of the most watched Nigerian music videos on YouTube,<br>
with the original, official music video, having over 215 million views.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2015 song, Way Maker, from Sinach.<br>

There has recently been another TobyMac song which has become important and meaningful to my family.<br>
<br>
<br>
According to Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, in January of 2023,<br>
<br>
TobyMac was originally a member of DC Talk from 1988 to 2001.<br>
Since 2001, he has released nine studio albums, two Christmas albums, five remix albums, three live albums, and three extended plays as a solo artist.<br>
<br>
The ninth studio album by American singer TobyMac,<br>
is titled, Life After Death,<br>
and the album was released on 19 August 2022.<br>
<br>
The album's lead single, "Help Is On the Way (Maybe Midnight)",<br>
peaked at number three on the Hot Christian Songs chart, which is a music chart published weekly by Billboard magazine in the United States.<br>
The song was released as a single on 19 February 2021.<br>
The music video was released on the same day, 19 February 2021.<br>
In other words, after that single was released,<br>
exactly one and a half years went by before the album was released.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2021 song,<br>
"Help Is On The Way (Maybe Midnight)"<br>
by TobyMac.<br>
<br>
<br>
May be midnight or mid-day<br>
Never early, never late<br>
He gonna stand by what He claimed<br>
Lived enough life to say<br>
<br>
I heard your heart, I see your pain<br>
Out in the dark, out in the rain<br>
Feels so alone, feels so afraid<br>
I heard you pray in Jesus' name<br>
<br>
It may be midnight or mid-day<br>
He's never early, never late<br>
He gonna stand by what He claimed<br>
I lived enough life to say (Say, say, say)<br>
<br>
Help is on the way<br>
Roundin' the corner<br>
Help is on the way<br>
Comin' for ya<br>
Help is on the way<br>
Yea-ee-yayy<br>
I lived enough life to say<br>
Help is on the way<br>
<br>
<br>
Sometimes it's days, sometimes it's years (Oh-oh)<br>
Some face a lifetime of fallen tears (Oh-oh)<br>
But He's in the darkness, He's in the cold<br>
Just like the mornin', He always shows (He always shows)<br>
<br>
It may be midnight or mid-day<br>
He's never early, never late<br>
He gon' stand by what He claimed<br>
I lived enough life to say (Say, say, say)<br>

<br>
<br>

Well, I seen my share o' troubles<br>
But the Lord ain't failed me yet<br>
So I'm holdin' on to the promise, y'all<br>
That He's rollin' up His sleeves again<br>
<br>
Said, I seen my share of troubles (Rollin' up, rollin' up)<br>
But the Lord ain't failed me yet (Rollin' up, rollin' up)<br>
We'll keep holdin' on to the promise, y'all (Rollin' up, rollin' up)<br>
That He's rollin' up His sleeves again<br>
<br>
Rollin' up, rollin' up (Don't ya know it?)<br>
Rollin' up His sleeves again (I can see Him rollin')<br>
Rollin' up, rollin' up (Help is comin')<br>
Rollin' up His sleeves again<br>

<br>
Billboard is an American music and entertainment magazine published weekly by Penske Media Corporation.<br>
The Billboard charts tabulate the relative weekly popularity of songs and albums in the United States and elsewhere.<br>

<br>
<br>
When looking at the Year-end charts in Billboard Magazine,<br>
The number one most popular Christian song in the United States for<br>
2019, 2020, and 2021, was the song,<br>
You Say<br>
by Lauren Daigle.<br>
<br>
However, in 2022, that changed.<br>
<br>
When looking at the Year-end charts in Billboard Magazine,<br>
for the end of the year, 2022,<br>
The number one most popular Christian song in the United States for 2022,<br>
was the song, In Jesus Name, by Katy Nichole.<br>
<br>
"In Jesus Name (God Of Possible)" is a song by<br>
American contemporary Christian music singer Katy Nichole,<br>
released on 26 January 2022.<br>
<br>
Her full name is Katy Nichole Litwiller.<br>

Here are the words to the most-popular Christian song of 2022, In Jesus Name (God of Possible)<br>
by Katy Nichole.<br>
<br>
<br>
I speak the name of Jesus over you<br>
In your hurting, in your sorrow<br>
I will ask my God to move<br>
I speak the name 'cause it's all that I can do<br>
In desperation, I'll seek Heaven<br>
And pray this for you<br>
<br>
<br>
I pray for your healing, that circumstances would change<br>
I pray that the fear inside would flee in Jesus' name<br>
I pray that a breakthrough would happen today<br>
I pray miracles over your life in Jesus' name<br>
In Jesus' name<br>
<br>
<br>
I speak the name of all authority<br>
Declaring blessings, every promise<br>
He is faithful to keep<br>
I speak the name no grave could ever hold<br>
He is greater, He is stronger<br>
He's the God of possible<br>
<br>
<br>
I pray for your healing, that circumstances would change<br>
I pray that the fear inside would flee in Jesus' name<br>
I pray that a breakthrough would happen today<br>
I pray miracles over your life in Jesus' name<br>
In Jesus' name, oh!<br>
<br>
<br>
Come believe it, come receive it<br>
Oh, the power of His Spirit is now forever yours<br>
Come believe it, come receive it<br>
In the mighty name of Jesus, all things are possible<br>
<br>
<br>
I pray for your healing, that circumstances will change<br>

According to Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, in January of 2023,<br>
<br>
Walter Stillman Martin (1862 - 1935), was an American Baptist minister<br>
who studied ministry at Harvard University.<br>
But he later switched to the denomination of Disciples of Christ.<br>
He was married to Civilla Durfee Martin (1866 - 1948),<br>
She was a Canadian-American writer of many religious hymns and gospel songs.<br>
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Walter Martin and his wife together<br>
created hymns and songs which have become widely known.<br>
<br>
One song that Civilla Durfee Martin wrote, which is one of her<br>
most popular songs, was titled, "God Will Take Care of You."<br>
<br>
Civilla wrote the words, and Walter wrote the music.<br>
<br>
The song was first published in the songbook,<br>
Songs of Redemption and Praise, which was released in 1905.<br>
The songbook was compiled by Walter Martin<br>
and the President of the Practical Bible Training School<br>
at Lestershire, New York, John A. Davis.<br>
<br>
The Practical Bible Training School, which started in the year 1900,<br>
later changed its name to Practical Bible College,<br>
and now operates today as a private Baptist bible college<br>
in Johnson City, New York,<br>
under the name of Davis College.<br>
<br>
One very interesting recording of this song, is performed by<br>
Tiffany Arbuckle Lee, better known by her stage name, Plumb.<br>
<br>
<br>
Originally signed as a contemporary Christian music recording artist in 1997,<br>
Plumb is now known as well as or better in alternative rock, electronic dance music,<br>
and for the use of her music in film and television<br>
than she is in the contemporary Christian music market.<br>
<br>
As of January 2023, Plumb had released eight albums.<br>
Her album titled, Blink, was the fifth album by Plumb.<br>
Released on 09 October 2007 via Curb Records,<br>
it is a collection of songs inspired by the singer's experiences as a mother.<br>
The album includes the single, "In My Arms."<br>
Her recording of, "God will take care of you," is found on this album.<br>
It was edited and remixed, and released as a promotional single,<br>
but did not achieve any radio popularity.<br>
This remix edit of her recording of, God will take care of you,<br>
is highly recommended, but is difficult to find.<br>
It has better bass and a stronger drum beat and a more prominent rhythm.<br>
The longer pauses in the song were also removed for this remix edit promotional single.<br>
The remix edit is only three minutes and thirty seconds in length,<br>
but, because it is so hard to find, one may only end up encountering the original, longer, album version.<br>
<br>
There are a few other hymns with this same title, and many other recordings that have this same song title,<br>
but the remix edit by Plumb may be one of the most interesting, if you're lucky enough to find it.<br>
If you do a search for, "Plumb God will take care of you"<br>
and you find one version that is only three minutes and thirty seconds in length,<br>
that could be the rare remix edit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
From the songbook, Songs of Redemption and Praise,<br>
here are the words to the 1905 song, God will take care of you,<br>
by Walter and Civilla Martin.<br>

<br>
A Missing Fragment<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 14:33 (KJV)<br>
...whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.<br>
<br>
Luke 14:33 (NLT)<br>
...you cannot become my disciple without giving up everything you own.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus<br>
Luke 16: 19-31 NLT<br>
19 Jesus said, "There was a certain rich man who was splendidly clothed in purple and fine linen and who lived each day in luxury.<br>
20 At his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus who was covered with sores.<br>
21 As Lazarus lay there longing for scraps from the rich man's table, the dogs would come and lick his open sores.<br>
<br>
(Finally, the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom.)<br>
(The rich man also died and was buried, and he went to Hades.)<br>
22 "Finally, the poor man died and was carried by the angels to sit beside Abraham at the heavenly banquet.  The rich man also died and was buried,<br>
23 and he went to the place of the dead. There, in torment, he (the rich man) saw Abraham in the far distance with Lazarus at his side.<br>
24 "The rich man shouted, 'Father Abraham, have some pity! Send Lazarus over here to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue. I am in anguish in these flames.'<br>
25 "But Abraham said to him, 'Son, remember that during your lifetime you had everything you wanted, and Lazarus had nothing. So now he is here being comforted, and you are in anguish.<br>
26 And besides, there is a great chasm separating us. No one can cross over to you from here, and no one can cross over to us from there.'<br>
27 "Then the rich man said, 'Please, Father Abraham, at least send him to my father's home.<br>
28 For I have five brothers, and I want him to warn them so they don't end up in this place of torment.'<br>
29 "But Abraham said, 'Moses and the prophets have warned them. Your brothers can read what they wrote.'<br>
30 "The rich man replied, 'No, Father Abraham! But if someone is sent to them from the dead, then they will repent of their sins and turn to God.'<br>
31 "But Abraham said, 'If they won't listen to Moses and the prophets, they won't be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.'"<br>
<br>
Commentary: The warnings are in the Bible. We all have easy, free access to the entire Bible and these warnings.<br>
The entire Bible and all of its warnings, are all online and can be read for free, without any signup or registration.<br>
That same computer or smart phone that people use all day for social media, streaming videos, porn and gaming,<br>
that same device has total access to the entire Bible and all of its warnings.<br>
If they won't heed and obey and read, study, guard and keep the warnings of the Bible, they won't be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.<br>
Jesus was risen from the dead.<br>
If the devil can't make you bad, he'll make you busy.<br>
How many people could say to themselves, I'm just too busy doing those other things on my phone to actually read the Bible and actually try to obey and do what it says?<br>
This place described here in Luke 16 matches the description of a place mentioned in The Book of 4 Ezra 2nd Esdras, in a section that was deliberately removed and lost for over a thousand years.<br>
It was just recently discovered, and restored, and now we will read this lost and forgotten passage here in just a moment.<br>
<br>
Luke 23:43 (NLT)<br>
And Jesus replied, "I assure you, today you will be with me in paradise."<br>

<br>
In January of 2023, there is an interesting article found at Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia.<br>
<br>
The Wikipedia link at that time was as follows.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sangermanensis_I%23%22The_Missing_Fragment%22_from_II_Esdras">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sangermanensis_I%23%22The_Missing_Fragment%22_from_II_Esdras</a><br>
<br>
The title of this Wikipedia webpage is, Codex Sangermanensis I.<br>
<br>
Here is a short, paraphrased summary about something said on that webpage.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of 4 Ezra 2nd Esdras had a section that was deliberately removed, on purpose.<br>
And then, for several centuries, for over one thousand years, no one seem to notice that it was gone.<br>
The clue was the sudden and strange glitch in the text as it suddenly seemed to cut into a different conversation.<br>
The KJV used to have this book in it, when it was originally released in 1611.<br>
And, in the KJV, the strange skip can be seen in the KJV English translation.<br>
<br>
In 1865, Johann Gildemeister (1812-1890), later Professor of Oriental Languages at the University of Bonn, discovered three clues.<br>
Being suspicious, he got his hands on what was probably the earliest known copy of the book of 4 Ezra 2nd Esdras.<br>
Looking at this book, he saw these three clues.<br>
Clue number 1. The topic of the conversation abruptly changes into the middle of a different subject, as though an unexpected edit or cut had happened.<br>
Clue number 2. The first letter of the new sentence on the next page was not, what we would call today, a capital letter or an uppercase letter.<br>
This would suggest that, that next sentence was not truly the beginning of the sentence, and so the actual start of that sentence is missing.<br>
Clue number 3. A close and careful physical examination of the physical book indicated that an entire page had been cut out of the book.<br>
<br>
<br>
These three clues indicated that a page had been cut out very early in the volume's history, perhaps within a very few decades of its writing of this copy in AD 822.<br>
People had been making copies of this text, not knowing that a page was missing from it.<br>
For the next ten years after 1865, a search was made to see if any other copies might contain the missing verses.<br>
An English orientalist, Robert L. Bensly discovered the Missing Fragment in 1875, but then he died in 1893.<br>
<br>
Additional copies of the Missing Fragment, in different languages and translations, were subsequently found, thereby confirming the accuracy and precision of the recovered text.<br>
<br>
Oxford and Cambridge Universities were working to revise the KJV during these years, and after starting in 1870,<br>
the Cambridge University Press eventually completed and released, in 1895, the translation known today as the<br>
Authorised Revision of KJV -- Revised Version with Apocrypha 1895 (RV1895) (1895)<br>
This release in 1895 contained the missing fragment of 4 Ezra 2nd Esdras, finally restored and put back into the Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
This means, some time shortly after 822, until the year of 1895, this missing chunk of this book was completely lost and forgotten<br>
for as long as one thousand and seventy-three (1073) years!<br>
Why did someone cut this page out of this book?<br>
Perhaps, it is because of it having a very discouraging account of the hideous fate awaiting most people<br>
and its statement that the prayers of others on their behalf would be unavailing.<br>
Maybe there are some religions where people pray certain prayers just before or after someone's death.<br>
And, maybe the people in those certain religions may have felt that doing those kind of prayers might be in direct opposition or violation of what was found on this page<br>
that was cut out of this book.<br>
<br>
For example, if the Catholics have a prayer known as Last Rites, could this missing page be suggesting that there is no such thing as Last Rites and that Last Rites does not actually work?<br>
Are people praying certain kinds of traditional prayers?<br>
Is this missing page telling us that some kinds of prayers like those may not really do anything at all?<br>
<br>
Maybe that is why someone cut this page out of this book.<br>
<br>
Now that the missing fragment has been restored, let's see what it says.<br>
Again, this book was in the KJV when it was first released, but what we are about to read, was missing from the KJV.<br>
This missing page was between verse 36 and verse 37 in the KJV.<br>
We will start in verse 32 and keep reading into the missing fragment.<br>
Before we begin, let's read a bit of the notes about this in the 1895 Apocrypha Preface.<br>
<br>
The Book of 4 Ezra 2nd Esdras<br>
Chapter 7, verses 32 through 105<br>
Authorised Revision of KJV -- Revised Version with Apocrypha 1895 (RV1895) (1895)<br>
The passage from verse 36 to verse 105, formerly missing, has been restored to the text.<br>
<br>
A quoted section from the Apocrypha, Preface (1895)<br>
<br>
After the revision of the Old Testament had been completed, the Old Testament Company (on 9 July 1884) passed the following resolution: --<br>
<br>
'That the Dean of Peterborough (Dr. Perowne), Professor Lumby, Professor Robertson Smith, Mr. Bensly, Mr. Cheyne, and the Secretary (Mr. Aldis Wright) be a Committee to translate the remaining books of the Apocrypha, and That Dr. Field be invited to assist in the formation of the text.'<br>
<br>
The Dean of Peterborough (Dr. Perowne), now Bishop of Worcester, and Mr. (now Professor) Cheyne, found themselves unable to take part in the work, and the Committee were deprived of the assistance of Dr. Field by his death in April, 1885.<br>
<br>
The Books of the Apocrypha which were left for them to revise were 1 and 2 Esdras, the additions to Esther, Baruch, the Song of the Three Holy Children, the History of Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, and the Prayer of Manasses.<br>
<br>
For the text of these portions, with the exception of 2 Esdras, they were entirely dependent upon the inadequate materials already existing, and did not therefore attempt any complete revision. But as the late Professor Bensly had reconstructed the text of the Latin version of 2 Esdras from a full collation of all the independent manuscripts (handwritten documents).<br>
<br>
At present known, the Committee fully availed themselves of the results which he generously placed at their disposal. They were thus able to incorporate the missing fragment, verses 36 through 105, which was edited by Professor Bensly with elaborate care, and published by the Cambridge University Press (1875), and to make use of many improved readings which he proposed to adopt in his critical edition. It is satisfactory to know that this work has been left in a sufficiently forward state to admit of its being easily completed.<br>
<br>
In regard to the language of the Revised Version, the Committee followed the general principles which were observed by the Old Testament Revision Company. In the case of Proper Names it has not been found possible to secure uniformity of plan in the work of the four Committees. In some Books these names appear in their familiar Old Testament forms, after the Hebrew; whilst in others, the forms of the Authorised Version are usually retained, or are but slightly altered, in accordance with the Greek.<br>
<br>
Lists of the Greek readings -- or, in 2 Esdras, the Latin readings  -- adopted by the Committees will shortly be published.* Such is a brief account of the circumstances under which the present work was executed. The Revisers conclude with the hope and the belief that it will be found helpful to the student, and acceptable to the general reader of the Apocrypha.<br>
<br>
This is the end of the quoted section from the Apocrypha, Preface, which was published in January, 1895.<br>
<br>
An updated message was added to the preface three years later, in July of 1898.<br>
<br>
In regards for the previously announced plan to publish the Lists of the Greek readings -- or, in 2 Esdras, the Latin readings  -- adopted by the Committees, the planned publication was cancelled and was never actually completed, because the person working on it had passed away.<br>
<br>
The actual update about this is quoted as saying,<br>
<br>
* The preparation of these lists was undertaken by Dr. Moulton. As however the work was still far from complete at the time of his death in February 1898, the publication of the readings has now been abandoned.<br>
<br>
That is the end of the quoted update, which was added in July, 1898.<br>
<br>
We will now read from...<br>

<br>
The Book of 4 Ezra 2nd Esdras<br>
Chapter 7, verses 32 through 105<br>
Authorised Revision of KJV -- Revised Version with Apocrypha 1895 (RV1895) (1895)<br>
<br>
32 And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her, and so shall the dust those that dwell therein in silence, and the secret places (and the chambers) shall deliver those souls that were committed unto them.<br>
<br>
33 And the Most High shall be revealed upon the seat of judgement, (and the end shall come) and compassion shall pass away, and longsuffering shall be withdrawn:<br>
<br>
34 But judgement only shall remain, truth shall stand, and faith shall wax strong:<br>
35 And the work shall follow, and the reward shall be shewed, and good deeds shall awake, and wicked deeds shall not sleep.<br>
<br>
(And the place of torment shall appear,)<br>
36 And the pit of torment shall appear, and over against it shall be the place of rest: and (Gehenna) the furnace of hell shall be shewed, and over against it the paradise of delight.<br>
37 And then shall the Most High say to the nations that are raised from the dead, See ye and understand whom ye have denied, or whom ye have not served, or whose commandments ye have despised.<br>
<br>
38 Look on this side and on that: here is delight and rest, and there fire and torments.<br>
(Thus shalt thou speak unto them in the day of judgement:)<br>
Thus shall he speak unto them in the day of judgement:<br>
<br>
39 This is a day that hath neither sun, nor moon, nor stars,<br>
40 Neither cloud, nor thunder, nor lightning, neither wind, nor water, nor air, neither darkness, nor evening, nor morning,<br>
<br>
41 Neither summer, nor spring, nor heat, (nor storm,) nor winter, neither frost, nor cold, nor hail, nor rain, nor dew,<br>
42 Neither noon, nor night, nor dawn, neither shining, nor brightness, nor light, save only the splendour of the glory of the Most High, whereby all shall see the things that are set before them:<br>
43 For it shall endure as it were a week of years.<br>
44 This is my judgement and the ordinance thereof; but to thee only have I shewed these things.<br>
45 And I answered, I said even then, O Lord, and I say now: Blessed are they that be now alive and keep the statutes ordained of thee.<br>
46 But as touching them for whom my prayer was made, what shall I say? for who is there of them that be alive that hath not sinned, and who of the sons of men that hath not transgressed thy covenant?<br>
47 And now I see, that the world to come shall bring delight to few, but torments unto many.<br>
48 For an evil heart hath grown up in us, which hath led us astray from these statutes, and hath brought us into corruption and into the ways of death, hath shewed us the paths of perdition and removed us far from life; and that, not a few only, but well nigh all that have been created.<br>
49 And he answered me, and said, Hearken unto me, and I will instruct thee; and I will admonish thee yet again:<br>
50 For this cause the Most High hath not made one world, but two.<br>
51 For whereas thou hast said that the just are not many, but few, and the ungodly abound, hear the answer thereunto.<br>
<br>
<br>
52 If thou have choice stones exceeding few, wilt thou set for thee over against them according to their number things of lead and clay?<br>
<br>
(In the verse that we just read, which is verse 52, The Latin in this verse is corrupt.)<br>
<br>
53 And I said, Lord, how shall this be?<br>
54 And he said unto me, Not only this, but ask the earth, and she shall tell thee; intreat her, and she shall declare unto thee.<br>
55 For thou shalt say unto her, Thou bringest forth gold and silver and brass, and iron also and lead and clay:<br>
56 But silver is more abundant than gold, and brass than silver, and iron than brass, lead than iron, and clay than lead.<br>
57 Judge thou therefore which things are precious and to be desired, whatso is abundant or what is rare.<br>
58 And I said, O Lord that bearest rule, that which is plentiful is of less worth, for that which is more rare is more precious.<br>
<br>
(In the next two verses, verse 59 and verse 60, The Latin in these two verses is corrupt.)<br>
<br>
59 And he answered me, and said, Weigh within thyself the things that thou hast thought, for he that hath what is hard to get rejoiceth over him that hath what is plentiful.<br>
<br>
60 So also is the judgement which I have promised: for I will rejoice over the few that shall be saved, inasmuch as these are they that have made my glory now to prevail, and of whom my name is now named.<br>
61 And I will not grieve over the multitude of them that perish; for these are they that are now like unto vapour, and are become as flame and smoke; they are set on fire and burn hotly, and are quenched.<br>
62 And I answered and said, O thou earth, wherefore hast thou brought forth, if the mind is made out of dust, like as all other created things?<br>
63 For it were better that the dust itself had been unborn, so that the mind might not have been made therefrom.<br>
64 But now the mind groweth with us, and by reason of this we are tormented, because we perish and know it.<br>
65 Let the race of men lament and the beasts of the field be glad; let all that are born lament, but let the fourfooted beasts and the cattle rejoice.<br>
66 For it is far better with them than with us; for they look not for judgement, neither do they know of torments or of salvation promised unto them after death.<br>
67 For what doth it profit us, that we shall be preserved alive, but yet be afflicted with torment?<br>
68 For all that are born are defiled with iniquities, and are full of sins and laden with offences:<br>
<br>
(In the verse that we just read, which is verse 68, The Latin in that verse is corrupt.)<br>
<br>
69 And if after death we were not to come into judgement, peradventure it had been better for us.<br>
70 And he answered me, and said, When the Most High made the world, and Adam and all them that came of him, he first prepared the judgement and the things that pertain unto the judgement.<br>
71 And now understand from thine own words, for thou hast said that the mind groweth with us.<br>
72 They therefore that dwell upon the earth shall be tormented for this reason, that having understanding they have wrought iniquity, and receiving commandments have not kept them, and having obtained a law they dealt unfaithfully with that which they received.<br>
73 What then will they have to say in the judgement, or how will they answer in the last times?<br>
74 For how great a time hath the Most High been longsuffering with them that inhabit the world, and not for their sakes, but because of the times which he hath foreordained!<br>
75 And I answered and said, If I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, shew this also unto thy servant, whether after death, even now when every one of us giveth up his soul, we shall be kept in rest until those times come, in which thou shalt renew the creation, or whether we shall be tormented forthwith.<br>
76 And he answered me, and said, I will shew thee this also; but join not thyself with them that are scorners, nor number thyself with them that are tormented.<br>
77 For thou hast a treasure of good works laid up with the Most High, but it shall not be shewed thee until the last times.<br>
78 For concerning death the teaching is: When the determinate sentence hath gone forth from the Most High that a man should die, as the spirit leaveth the body to return again to him who gave it, it adoreth the glory of the Most High first of all.<br>
<br>
(And if it be one of those that have been scorners and have not kept the way of the Most High, and that have despised his law, and that hate them that fear Him,)<br>
79 And if it be one of those that have been scorners and have not kept the way of the Most High, and that have despised his law, and that hate them that fear God,<br>
<br>
80 These spirits shall not enter into habitations, but shall wander and be in torments forthwith, ever grieving and sad, in seven ways.<br>
81 The first way, because they have despised the law of the Most High.<br>
82 The second way, because they cannot now make a good returning that they may live.<br>
83 The third way, they shall see the reward laid up for them that have believed the covenants of the Most High.<br>
84 The fourth way, they shall consider the torment laid up for themselves in the last days.<br>
85 The fifth way, they shall see the dwelling places of the others guarded by angels, with great quietness.<br>
<br>
(In the next two verses, verse 86 and verse 87, some parts of these two verses are corrupt.)<br>
<br>
86 The sixth way, they shall see how forthwith some of them shall pass into torment.<br>
<br>
(The seventh way, which is greater than all the aforesaid ways,)<br>
87 The seventh way, which is more grievous than all the aforesaid ways, because they shall pine away in confusion and be consumed with shame, and shall be withered up by fears, seeing the glory of the Most High before whom they have sinned whilst living, and before whom they shall be judged in the last times.<br>
88 Now this is the order of those who have kept the ways of the Most High, when they shall be separated from the corruptible vessel.<br>
<br>
(In the next verse, verse 89, The Latin is corrupt.)<br>
<br>
89 In the time that they dwelt therein they painfully served the Most High, and were in jeopardy every hour, that they might keep the law of the lawgiver perfectly.<br>
90 Wherefore this is the teaching concerning them:<br>
91 First of all they shall see with great joy the glory of him who taketh them up, for they shall have rest in seven orders.<br>
92 The first order, because they have striven with great labour to overcome the evil thought which was fashioned together with them, that it might not lead them astray from life into death.<br>
93 The second order, because they see the perplexity in which the souls of the ungodly wander, and the punishment that awaiteth them.<br>
94 The third order, they see the witness which he that fashioned them beareth concerning them, that whilst they lived they kept the law which was given them in trust.<br>
95 The fourth order, they understand the rest which, being gathered in their chambers, they now enjoy with great quietness, guarded by angels, and the glory that awaiteth them in the last days.<br>
<br>
(In the next verse, verse 96, The Latin is corrupt.)<br>
<br>
96 The fifth order, they rejoice, seeing how they have now escaped from that which is corruptible, and how they shall inherit that which is to come, whilst they see moreover the straitness and the painfulness from which they have been delivered, and the large room which they shall receive with joy and immortality.<br>
97 The sixth order, when it is shewed unto them how their face shall shine as the sun, and how they shall be made like unto the light of the stars, being henceforth incorruptible.<br>
98 The seventh order, which is greater than all the aforesaid orders, because they shall rejoice with confidence, and because they shall be bold without confusion, and shall be glad without fear, for they hasten to behold the face of him whom in their lifetime they served, and from whom they shall receive their reward in glory.<br>
<br>
(In the next verse, verse 99, The Latin is corrupt.)<br>
<br>
99 This is the order of the souls of the just, as from henceforth is announced unto them, and aforesaid are the ways of torture which they that would not give heed shall suffer from henceforth.<br>
100 And I answered and said, Shall time therefore be given unto the souls after they are separated from the bodies, that they may see that whereof thou hast spoken unto me?<br>
101 And he said, Their freedom shall be for seven days, that for seven days they may see the things whereof thou hast been told, and afterwards they shall be gathered together in their habitations.<br>
102 And I answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, shew further unto me thy servant whether in the day of judgement the just will be able to intercede for the ungodly or to intreat the Most High for them,<br>
103 Whether fathers for children, or children for parents, or brethren for brethren, or kinsfolk for their next of kin, or friends for them that are most dear.<br>
<br>
104 And he answered me, and said, Since thou hast found favour in my sight, I will shew thee this also:<br>
(The day of judgement is a bold day of decision,)<br>
The day of judgement is a day of decision, and displayeth unto all the seal of truth; even as now a father sendeth not his son, or a son his father, or a master his slave,<br>
(or a friend him that is most dear, that in his stead he may understand)<br>
or a friend him that is most dear, that in his stead he may be sick, or sleep, or eat, or be healed:<br>
<br>
(So never shall any one pray for another, for then shall all bear every one his own righteousness or unrighteousness.)<br>
105 So never shall any one pray for another in that day, neither shall one lay a burden on another, for then shall all bear every one his own righteousness or unrighteousness.<br>

Luke 23:43 (NLT)<br>
And Jesus replied, "I assure you, today you will be with me in paradise."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The name of the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob, the name of the Lord, our heavenly Father, is Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, if spelled using English letters, could possibly be spelled like this: Y a h u a h .<br>
In Hebrew, The Lord of Hosts is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat.<br>
So, every time there was the Hebrew words, Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat, we use the English term, The Lord of Hosts.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat, which is, the Lord of Hosts, can also mean, God of Hosts, Lord Yaw-Who-Wah God of Hosts, The Lord of Armies, The Lord of Heaven's Armies, The Lord of the Angel Armies, the God of Angel Armies, and the God of the Armies of Heaven.<br>
To spell Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat using English letters, it could be spelled like this, Y a h u a h (space) T s e v a (apostrophe) o t h .<br>
<br>
The name of Jesus in Hebrew is pronounced, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, is known as the Elect One in the book of Enoch.<br>
Jesus is Salvation. To say that in Hebrew, we would say, Yaw-Who-Shaw is Yeh-Shoe-Uh.<br>
Yeh-Shoe-Uh means, Salvation, in Hebrew.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hebrew word for God, is, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
To spell ELL-Low-Heem with English letters, it could be spelled like this, E L o h i y m ,<br>
or sometimes, with an I instead of a Y, like this: E l o h i m .<br>
Elohim, with the letter I, is how it is spelled in the TS2009.<br>
In the Eth Cepher, it is spelled with a Y, like this, E L o h i y m .<br>
<br>
<br>
In the Eth Cepher English Translation, we see a Hebrew word that, in English, would be, the Most High God.<br>
In Hebrew, The Most High God, is pronounced, ELL-ELLE-ON.<br>
With English letters, it gets spelled with a letter Y, like this, E L (space) E L y o n .<br>
<br>
The Most High God, El Elyon (EL-ELLE-ON) is mentioned several times in this book.<br>

The Book of 4 Ezra 2nd Esdras<br>
Chapter 7, verses 36 through 105<br>
Eth Cepher English Translation, 2020 edition<br>
<br>
36 Then the pit of torment shall appear, and opposite it shall be the place of rest; and the furnace of She'ol shall be disclosed, and opposite it the paradise of delight.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The paradise of delight, found here in verse 36, sounds like the same paradise that we just looked at<br>
in the book of Luke 23:43.<br>
<br>
Let's read that verse 36 again, and keep going.<br>
<br>
36 Then the pit of torment shall appear, and opposite it shall be the place of rest; and the furnace of She'ol shall be disclosed, and opposite it the paradise of delight.<br>
37 Then The Most High God, El Elyon (EL-ELLE-ON) will say to the nations that have been raised from the dead: Look now, and understand whom ye have denied, whom ye have not served, whose commandments ye have despised!<br>
38 Look on this side and on that; here are delight and rest, and there are fire and torments! Thus, he will speak to them on the day of judgement.<br>
39 A day that has no sun or moon or stars,<br>
40 or cloud or thunder or lightning or wind or water or air, or darkness or evening or morning,<br>
41 or summer or spring or heat or winter or frost or cold or hail or rain or dew,<br>
42 or noon or night, or dawn or shining or brightness or light, but only the splendour of the glory of The Most High God, El Elyon (EL-ELLE-ON), by which all shall see what has been determined for them.<br>
43 For it will last for about a week of years.<br>
44 This is my judgement and its prescribed order; and to you alone have I shown these things.<br>
45 I answered and said: O Yahuah Tseva'oth (Yaw-Who-Wah Save-Ah-Oat, the Lord of Hosts),  I said then and I say now: Blessed are those who are alive and guard your commandments!<br>
46 But what of those for whom I prayed? For who amongst the living is there that has not sinned, or who amongst men that has not transgressed your covenant?<br>
47 And now I see that the world to come will bring delight to few, but torments to many.<br>
48 For an evil heart has grown up in us, which has alienated us from Elohiym (ELL-Low-Heem), and has brought us into corruption and the ways of death and has shown us the paths of perdition and removed us far from life; and that not just a few of us but almost all who have been created!<br>
49 He answered me and said: Listen to me, Ezra, and I will instruct you, and will admonish you yet again.<br>
50 For this reason El Elyon has made not one world but two.<br>
51 For whereas you have said that the righteous are not many but few, whilst the wicked abound, hear the explanation for this.<br>
52 If you have just a few precious stones, will you add to them lead and clay?<br>
53 I said: Yahuah, how could that be?<br>
54 And he said to me: Not only that but ask the earth and she will tell you; defer to her, and she will declare it to you.<br>
55 Say to her: You produce gold and silver and brass, and also iron and lead and clay;<br>
56 but silver is more abundant than gold, and brass than silver, and iron than brass, and lead than iron, and clay than lead.<br>
57 Judge therefore which things are precious and desirable, those that are abundant or those that are rare?<br>
58 I said: O Yahuah Tseva'oth, what is plentiful is of less worth, for what is more rare is more precious.<br>
59 He answered me and said: Weigh within yourself what you have thought, for he who has what is hard to get rejoices more than he who has what is plentiful.<br>
60 So also will be the judgement which I have promised; for I will rejoice over the few who shall be saved, because it is they who have made my glory to prevail now, and through them my name has now been honoured.<br>
61 And I will not grieve over the multitude of those who perish; for it is they who are now like a mist and are similar to a flame and smoke. They are set on fire and burn hotly and are extinguished.<br>
62 I replied and said: O earth, what have you brought forth, if the mind is made out of the dust like the other created things!<br>
63 For it would have been better if the dust itself had not been born, so that the mind might not have been made from it.<br>
64 But now the mind grows with us, and therefore we are tormented, because we perish and know it.<br>
65 Let mankind lament but let the beasts of the field be glad; let all who have been born lament but let the four-footed beasts and the flocks rejoice!<br>
66 For it is much better with them than with us; for they do not look for a judgement, nor do they know of any torment or yeshu'ah (Yeh-Shoe-Uh) promised to them after death.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
What we just saw here in verse 66,<br>
Yeh-Shoe-Uh means, salvation.<br>
That is the Hebrew word for salvation.<br>
Jesus is salvation.<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw is Yeh-Shoe-Uh.<br>
<br>
Let's read verse 66 again with the English word inserted, and then we will keep reading here in the Eth Cepher English Translation, 2020 edition.<br>
(For it is much better with them than with us; for they do not look for a judgement, nor do they know of any torment or salvation promised to them after death.)<br>
67 For what does it profit us that we shall be preserved alive but cruelly tormented?<br>
68 For all who have been born are involved in iniquities and are full of sins and burdened with transgressions.<br>
69 And if we were not to come into judgement after death, perhaps it would have been better for us.<br>
70 He answered me and said: When El Elyon made the world and A'dam and all who have come from him, he first prepared the judgement and the things that pertain to the judgement.<br>
71 And now understand from your own words, for you have said that the mind grows with us.<br>
72 For this reason, therefore, those who dwell on earth shall be tormented, because though they had understanding they committed iniquity, and though they received the commandments they did not guard them, and though they obtained the Torah they dealt unfaithfully with what they received.<br>
73 What, then, will they have to say in the judgement, or how will they answer in the last times?<br>
74 For how long the time is that El Elyon has been patient with those who inhabit the world, and not for their sake, but because of the times which he has foreordained!<br>
75 I answered and said: If I have found favour in your sight, O Yahuah, show this also to your servant: whether after death, as soon as every one of us yields up his soul, we shall be kept in rest until those times come when you will renew the creation, or whether we shall be tormented at once?<br>
76 He answered me and said: I will show you that also, but do not be associated with those who have shown scorn, nor number yourself amongst those who are tormented.<br>
77 For you have a treasure of works laid up with El Elyon; but it will not be shown to you until the last times.<br>
78 Now, concerning death, the teaching is: When the decisive decree has gone forth from El Elyon that a man shall die, as the ruach leaves the body to return again to him who gave it, first of all it adores the glory of El Elyon.<br>
79 And if it is one of those who have shown scorn and have not guarded the Way of El Elyon, and who have despised his Torah, and who have hated those who fear Elohiym;<br>
80 such spirits, (such ROO-Awk,) shall not enter into habitations, but shall immediately wander about in torments, ever grieving and sad, in seven ways.<br>
81 The first way, because they have scorned the Torah of El Elyon.<br>
82 The second way, because they cannot now make a good repentance that they may live.<br>
83 The third way, they shall see the reward laid up for those who have trusted the covenants of El Elyon.<br>
84 The fourth way, they shall consider the torment laid up for themselves in the last days.<br>
85 The fifth way, they shall see how the habitations of the others are guarded by angels in profound quiet.<br>
86 The sixth way, they shall see how some of them will pass over into torments.<br>
87 The seventh way, which is worse than all the ways that have been mentioned, because they shall utterly waste away in confusion and be consumed with shame and shall wither with fear at seeing the glory of El Elyon before whom they sinned whilst they were alive, and before whom they are to be judged in the last times.<br>
88 Now this is the order of those who have guarded the ways of El Elyon, when they shall be separated from their mortal body.<br>
89 During the time that they lived in it, they labouriously served El Elyon, and withstood danger every hour, that they might guard the Torah of the Torah giver perfectly.<br>
90 Therefore this is the teaching concerning them:<br>
91 First of all, they shall see with great joy the glory of him who receives them, for they shall have rest in seven orders.<br>
92 The first order, because they have striven with great effort to overcome the evil thought which was formed with them, that it might not lead them astray from life into death.<br>
93 The second order, because they see the perplexity in which the souls of the wicked wander, and the punishment that awaits them.<br>
94 The third order, they see the witness which he who formed them bears concerning them, that whilst they were alive they guarded the Torah which was given them in trust.<br>
95 The fourth order, they understand the rest which they now enjoy, being gathered into their chambers and guarded by angels in profound quiet, and the glory which awaits them in the last days.<br>
96 The fifth order, they rejoice that they have now escaped what is corruptible and shall inherit what is to come; and besides they see the straits and toil from which they have been delivered, and the spacious liberty which they are to receive and enjoy in immortality.<br>
97 The sixth order, when it is shown to them how their face is to shine like the sun, and how they are to be made like the light of the stars, being incorruptible from then on.<br>
98 The seventh order, which is greater than all that have been mentioned, because they shall rejoice with boldness, and shall be confident without confusion, and shall be glad without fear, for they hasten to behold the face of him whom they served in life and from whom they are to receive their reward when glorified.<br>
99 This is the order of the souls of the righteous, as henceforth is announced; and the aforesaid are the ways of torment which those who would not give heed shall suffer hereafter.<br>
100 I answered and said: Will time therefore be given to the souls, after they have been separated from the bodies, to see what you have described to me?<br>
101 He said to me: They shall have freedom for seven days, so that during these seven days they may see the things of which you have been told, and afterwards they shall be gathered in their habitations.<br>
102 I answered and said: If I have found favour in your sight, show further to me, your servant, whether on the day of judgement the righteous will be able to intercede for the wicked or to pray to El Elyon for them,<br>
103 fathers for sons or sons for parents, brothers for brothers, relatives for their kinsmen, or friends for those who are most dear.<br>
104 He answered me and said: Since you have found favour in my sight, I will show you this also. The day of judgement is decisive and displays to all the seal of truth. Just as now a father does not send his son, or a son his father, or a master his servant, or a friend his dearest friend, to be ill or sleep or eat or be healed in his place,<br>
105 so no one shall ever pray for another on that day, neither shall anyone lay a burden on another; for then everyone shall bear his own righteousness and unrighteousness.<br>
