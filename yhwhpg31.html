Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what is MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>

Let's take a moment to read the lyrics to a few interesting Christian songs.<br>
<br>
At the end of August 2022, my family was enjoying two new songs from TobyMac's latest album, which had just been released.<br>
<br>
One of those songs featured TobyMac with his mates from DC Talk, basically performing what could be thought of as a brand new song from DC Talk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TobyMac was originally a member of DC Talk from 1987 to 2001.<br>
Since 2001, TobyMac has released eight studio albums, two Christmas albums, five remix albums, three live albums, and three extended plays as a solo artist.<br>
<br>
<br>
His eighth studio album, Life After Death<br>
was released on<br>
Friday 19 August 2022<br>
and is available as a digital download, a physical Audio CD, or as an analogue, vinyl long-playing record.<br>
<br>
<br>
The title of this album, and some of the content in his recent songs may be influenced by the tragic death of his son.<br>
TobyMac has five children, and it was his firstborn son,<br>
Truett McKeehan, that was found dead at his home in Nashville on 23 October 2019, at age 21,<br>
of what appears to be, or what has been said to be,<br>
an accidental drug overdose of fentanyl and amphetamines.<br>
<br>
One of the songs on the Life After Death album is titled, Faithfully.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2022 song, Faithfully, by TobyMac...<br>
<br>
<br>
It's been a long year<br>
It almost took me down, I swear<br>
Life was so good<br>
I'm not so sure we knew what we had<br>
I'll never be the same man<br>
I'll never feel like I felt before<br>
like I felt before<br>
It's been a hard year<br>
It almost took me down<br>
<br>
<br>
But when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
I've had a hard time<br>
Findin' the blue in the skies above me<br>
And if I'm keepin' it real<br>
I've been half-fakin' the happy they'd see<br>
I may look like the same man<br>
But I'm half the man I was (Half the man I was)<br>
It's been a hard year<br>
It almost took me down<br>
<br>
<br>
But when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
In my darkest hour, You met me<br>
So quietly, so gently<br>
You said You'd never leave<br>
And you stood by Your word<br>
So quietly, so gently<br>
In all my pain, You met me<br>
You said You'd never leave<br>
And you stood by Your word<br>
<br>
<br>
'Cause when my world broke into pieces<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You made a way for me<br>
I may never be the same man<br>
But I'm a man who still believes<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>
<br>
When I cried out to You, Jesus<br>
You were there faithfully<br>
<br>

Here are the words to the 2022 song, titled, Space, featuring DC Talk, available on<br>
TobyMac's album, Life After Death.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I've replayed it like a thousand times, I rewind it in my head<br>
I can tell you that I lost my mind, or what I should've done instead<br>
'Cause the way that I felt when we parted ways<br>
Got me all in my head, got me countin' the days<br>
Got me hopin', got me prayin'<br>
You are in my heart<br>
<br>
<br>
But what do we do with this space<br>
What do we do with this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
How can we start to erase<br>
space, space<br>
How can we start to erase this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>
Would you step across a party line?<br>
Would you walk into my cold cell?<br>
Can you see me in a different light?<br>
Would you meet me at the well?<br>
Would you?<br>
<br>
<br>
'Cause the way that I feel when you look my way<br>
Got me all in my head, got me starting to think<br>
Is it too far? Are we too scarred?<br>
too scarred?<br>
Yeah the heart is there, but what do we do with this space<br>
<br>
<br>
Space, space<br>
What do we do with this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
How can we start to erase<br>
space, space<br>
How can we start to erase this space between us<br>
this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>

Yeah, I've got nothing but love for you<br>
Nothing but my love for you<br>
And I know you feel the same way too<br>
know you feel the same way too<br>
But this space, what do we do with this space between us<br>
<br>
<br>
What do we do with this space<br>
This space<br>
Oh, Oh. Woah!<br>
<br>
It keeps no record, it keeps no record of wrong<br>
It keeps no record, record, record<br>
<br>
Oh,<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record of wrong<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
We're never too far gone<br>
<br>
<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record of wrong<br>
it keeps no record<br>
Love keeps no record<br>
it keeps no record<br>
We're never too far gone<br>

Love keeps no record<br>

Love keeps no record of wrong<br>

At the end of August 2022, my family was also remembering and appreciating a great song that came out many years ago by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at the lyrics to an older song by Phil Wickham.<br>
As of August 2022, Phil Wickham has released nine albums.<br>
His album, The Ascension, his fifth commercial studio album, was released on<br>
24 September 2013.<br>
The standard edition contained just the regular, studio recordings,<br>
and the Deluxe edition also included an acoustic recording of all of the tracks as well.<br>
<br>
From this 2013 album, The Ascension, we will now be looking at the song, titled, Over All.<br>
Here are the words to the 2013 song, Over All, by Phil Wickham.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Micah 7: 7-20 (NIV)<br>
7<br>
But as for me, I watch in hope for the Lord,<br>
I wait for God my Saviour;<br>
my God will hear me.<br>
8<br>
Do not gloat over me, my enemy!<br>
Though I have fallen, I will rise.<br>
Though I sit in darkness,<br>
the Lord will be my light.<br>
9<br>
Because I have sinned against him,<br>
I will bear the Lord's wrath,<br>
until he pleads my case<br>
and upholds my cause.<br>
He will bring me out into the light;<br>
I will see his righteousness.<br>
10<br>
Then my enemy will see it<br>
and will be covered with shame,<br>
she who said to me,<br>
"Where is the Lord your God?"<br>
My eyes will see her downfall;<br>
even now she will be trampled underfoot<br>
like mire in the streets.<br>
11<br>
The day for building your walls will come,<br>
the day for extending your boundaries.<br>
12<br>
In that day people will come to you<br>
from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,<br>
even from Egypt to the Euphrates<br>
and from sea to sea<br>
and from mountain to mountain.<br>
13<br>
The earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants,<br>
as the result of their deeds.<br>
14<br>
Shepherd your people with your staff,<br>
the flock of your inheritance,<br>
which lives by itself in a forest,<br>
in fertile pasturelands.<br>
(in the middle of Carmel)<br>
Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead<br>
as in days long ago.<br>
15<br>
"As in the days when you came out of Egypt,<br>
I will show them my wonders."<br>
16<br>
Nations will see and be ashamed,<br>
deprived of all their power.<br>
They will put their hands over their mouths<br>
and their ears will become deaf.<br>
17<br>
They will lick dust like a snake,<br>
like creatures that crawl on the ground.<br>
They will come trembling out of their dens;<br>
they will turn in fear to the Lord our God<br>
and will be afraid of you.<br>
18<br>
Who is a God like you,<br>
who pardons sin and forgives the transgression<br>
of the remnant of his inheritance?<br>
You do not stay angry forever<br>
but delight to show mercy.<br>
19<br>
You will again have compassion on us;<br>
you will tread our sins underfoot<br>
and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.<br>
20<br>
You will be faithful to Jacob,<br>
and show love to Abraham,<br>
as you pledged on oath to our ancestors<br>
in days long ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 7-20 (KJV)<br>
7:7 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.<br>
7:8 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.<br>
7:9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgement for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.<br>
<br>
<br>
(And thou wilt see her that is mine enemy and cover her with shame which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now she shall be for a treading down as the mire of the streets.)<br>
7:10 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.<br>
<br>
7:11 In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed.<br>
<br>
(In that day also he shall come even to thee, even to Assyria, and even to the fortified cities, and even to the fortress, even to the river, and even to sea to sea, and even to mountain to mountain.)<br>
7:12 In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.<br>
<br>
(After that it hath been the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.)<br>
7:13 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.<br>
<br>
(Rule thy people with thy rod,)<br>
7:14 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them Feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.<br>
<br>
7:15 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things.<br>
7:16 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.<br>
<br>
7:17 They shall lick the dust like a serpent,<br>
(they shall move out of their holes like creeping things of the earth)<br>
they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.<br>
<br>
7:18 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.<br>
7:19 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<br>
7:20 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 7-20 (NLT)<br>
7<br>
As for me, I look to the Lord for help.<br>
I wait confidently for God to save me,<br>
and my God will certainly hear me.<br>
8<br>
Do not gloat over me, my enemies!<br>
For though I fall, I will rise again.<br>
Though I sit in darkness,<br>
the Lord will be my light.<br>
9<br>
I will be patient as the Lord punishes me,<br>
for I have sinned against him.<br>
But after that, he will take up my case<br>
and give me justice for all I have suffered from my enemies.<br>
The Lord will bring me into the light,<br>
and I will see his righteousness.<br>
10<br>
Then my enemies will see that the Lord is on my side.<br>
They will be ashamed that they taunted me, saying,<br>
"So where is the Lord --<br>
that God of yours?"<br>
With my own eyes I will see their downfall;<br>
they will be trampled like mud in the streets.<br>
11<br>
In that day, Israel, your cities will be rebuilt,<br>
and your borders will be extended.<br>
12<br>
People from many lands will come and honour you --<br>
from Assyria all the way to the towns of Egypt,<br>
from Egypt all the way to (the river,) the Euphrates River,<br>
and from distant seas and mountains.<br>
13<br>
But (the earth and) the land will become empty and desolate<br>
because of the wickedness of those who live there.<br>
14<br>
O Lord, protect your people with your shepherd's staff;<br>
lead your flock, your special possession.<br>
Though they live alone in a thicket<br>
(surrounded by a fruitful land)<br>
on the heights of Mount Carmel,<br>
let them graze in the fertile pastures of Bashan and Gilead<br>
as they did long ago.<br>
15<br>
"Yes," says the Lord,<br>
"I will do mighty miracles for you,<br>
like those I did when I rescued you<br>
from slavery in Egypt."<br>
16<br>
All the nations of the world will stand amazed<br>
at what the Lord will do for you.<br>
They will be embarrassed<br>
at their feeble power.<br>
They will cover their mouths in silent awe,<br>
deaf to everything around them.<br>
17<br>
Like snakes crawling from their holes,<br>
they will come out to meet the Lord our God.<br>
They will fear him greatly,<br>
trembling in terror at his presence.<br>
18<br>
Where is another God like you,<br>
who pardons the guilt of the remnant,<br>
overlooking the sins of his special people?<br>
You will not stay angry with your people forever,<br>
because you delight in showing unfailing love.<br>
19<br>
Once again you will have compassion on us.<br>
You will trample our sins under your feet<br>
and throw them into the depths of the ocean!<br>
20<br>
You will show us your faithfulness and unfailing love<br>
as you promised to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob long ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 7: 5-20 (TS2009)<br>
5 Trust no friend, rely on no companion, guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom.<br>
6 For son is despising father, daughter rises up against her mother, daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, the enemies of a man are the men of his own house.<br>
7 As for me, I look to Yah-Who-Wah, I wait for the ELL-Low-Heem of my deliverance, my ELL-Low-Heem does hear me.<br>
8 Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy. When I have fallen I have risen, when I sit in darkness Yah-Who-Wah is a light to me.<br>
9 I bear the displeasure of Yah-Who-Wah, for I have sinned against Him, until He pleads my case, and shall execute right-ruling for me, until He brings me out into the light and I look on His righteousness.<br>
10 And let my enemy see it, and let shame cover her who said to me, "Where is Yah-Who-Wah your ELL-Low-Heem?" Let my eyes look on her: now she is trampled down like mud in the streets.<br>
<br>
(Siege could be another name for Mitsrayim.)<br>
<br>
11 The day for building your walls! Let the law go far and wide in that day  --<br>
12 that day when they come to you from Ashshur and the besieged cities of Mitsrayim, (from Mitsrayim to the River) and from the siege to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.<br>
13 But the earth shall become a waste because of those who dwell in it, and for the fruit of their deeds.<br>
14 Shepherd Your people with Your rod, the flock of Your inheritance, who dwell alone in a forest, in the midst of Karmel (Care-Mel). Let them feed in Bashan and Gill-Odd, as in days of old.<br>
15 "As in the days when you came out of the land of Mitsrayim, I shall let him see wonders."<br>
16 Let the nations see and be ashamed of all their might, let them put their hand over their mouth, let their ears be deaf.<br>
17 Let them lick the dust like a serpent, let them come trembling from their strongholds like snakes of the earth, let them be afraid of Yah-Who-Wah our ELL-Low-Heem and fear because of You.<br>
18 Who is an ELL-Low-Heem like You  --  taking away crookedness and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance? He shall not retain His wrath forever, for He Himself delights in loving-commitment.<br>
19 He shall turn back, He shall have compassion on us, He shall trample upon our crookednesses! And You throw all our sins into the depths of the sea!<br>
20 You give truth to Yah-Coab, loving-commitment to Ah-Vrah-Hahm, which You swore to our fathers from the days of old!<br>
<br>
<br>

Although they each have their imperfections and their own issues with some areas of translation precision,<br>
The King James Version (KJV) (1st Edition, released in the year 1611) tells us what it SAYS in English,<br>
The New Living Translation (NLT) (5th Edition, 2015) tells us what is MEANS in English,<br>
And The Scriptures 2009 (TS2009) (3rd Edition, 2015) helps us pronounce the names in Hebrew whilst reading the Bible in English.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 15: 2-5 KJV<br>
15:2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.<br>
15:3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.<br>
15:4 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgements are made manifest.<br>
15:5 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:<br>
<br>
Revelation 15: 2-5 NLT<br>
2 I saw before me what seemed to be a glass sea mixed with fire. And on it stood all the people who had been victorious over the beast and his statue and the number representing his name. They were all holding harps that God had given them.<br>
3 And they were singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb:<br>
"Great and marvellous are your works,<br>
O Lord God, the Almighty.<br>
Just and true are your ways,<br>
O King of the nations.<br>
(King of the ages.)<br>
<br>
4<br>
Who will not fear you, Lord,<br>
and glorify your name?<br>
For you alone are holy.<br>
All nations will come and worship before you,<br>
for your righteous deeds have been revealed."<br>
5 Then I looked and saw that the Temple in heaven, God's Tabernacle, was thrown wide open.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 15: 2-5 TS2009<br>
2 And I saw like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those overcoming the beast and his image and his mark and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
3 And they sing the song of Moe-Shay the servant of ELL-Low-Heem, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvellous are Your works, Yaw-Who-Wah ELL Shuh-Dye! Righteous and true are Your ways, O Sovereign of the set-apart ones!<br>
4 "Who shall not fear You, O Yaw-Who-Wah, and esteem Your Name? Because You alone are kind. Because all nations shall come and worship before You, for Your righteousnesses have been made manifest."<br>
5 And after this I looked and saw the Dwelling Place of the Tent of Witness in the heaven was opened.<br>

<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ten Per Cent<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Many pastors of many churches and mega-churches may have, at one time or another,<br>
said something to this effect...<br>
<br>
The brothers are now going to come forward and collect the tithes and offerings.<br>
The first ten per cent of your income belongs to God.<br>
You are to give the first 10% of your income to the church.<br>
Any donation amount above that first 10% is optional, and that it known as an offering.<br>
You can choose to take the offering and have it designated to go towards a particular area of the church,<br>
or have it go towards a mission or a certain ministry of the church, if you want to, or you can leave that choice up to the church,<br>
based on where we have the greatest need.<br>
<br>
<br>
That might sound good, but is it really true?<br>
<br>
When someone says something that sounds true and good, we can search it out in the Bible, and we will likely come to one of three possible conclusions...<br>
1. It matches what the Bible says, and so it is true. Bible verses say it and support it and agree with what was said.<br>
2. It is not found in the Bible, which may indicate that it may not be true, and may, most likely be not true.<br>
3. the Bible says the opposite of that,<br>
there are Bible verses that say the opposite of that, and they are in direct opposition to what someone said,<br>
and so what that person said is absolutely not true, indicating that the person is a liar and an anti-christ.<br>
Or, maybe they are just making it all up, and they don't really care if it's true or not.<br>
They might just be making it up so that they can take your money.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, is this tithing to the church message true or not true?<br>
Let's find out here in just a moment.<br>
<br>
Tithing mainly had to do with the Temple of God.<br>
Where is this temple?<br>
The temple used to be right next to the spot where we see today a yellow building with a yellow dome roof.<br>
Since tithing is strongly associated with the temple, let's first consider something in Revelation 11.<br>
Whilst we are here in this chapter 11, let's also study the information about the two witnesses, and the end times,<br>
and then we will go back to our study about tithes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 10:11 (KJV) -- the last verse at the end of Chapter 10,<br>
and we keep on reading right into most of Chapter 11,<br>
stopping when we get to<br>
Revelation 11:14 (KJV)<br>
We now begin at Revelation 10:11 (KJV)<br>
10:11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.<br>
11:1 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.<br>
<br>
(But the court which is without the temple cast out, and measure it not;)<br>
11:2 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.<br>
<br>
(I will give unto my two witnesses that they may prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days)<br>
11:3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.<br>
11:4 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.<br>
11:5 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.<br>
11:6 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.<br>
11:7 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.<br>
11:8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.<br>
11:9 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.<br>
11:10 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.<br>
11:11 And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.<br>
11:12 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.<br>
11:13 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell,<br>
(and in the earthquake were slain names of men seven thousand)<br>
and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.<br>
11:14 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 10:11 (NLT) -- the last verse at the end of Chapter 10,<br>
and we keep on reading right into most of Chapter 11,<br>
stopping again when we get to<br>
Revelation 11:14 (NLT)<br>
11 Then I was told, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."<br>
1 Then I was given a measuring stick, and I was told, "Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the number of worshippers.<br>
2 But do not measure the outer courtyard, for it has been turned over to the nations. They will trample the holy city for 42 months.<br>
3 And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will be clothed in burlap and will prophesy during those 1,260 days."<br>
4 These two prophets are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of all the earth.<br>
5 If anyone tries to harm them, fire flashes from their mouths and consumes their enemies. This is how anyone who tries to harm them must die.<br>
6 They have power to shut the sky so that no rain will fall for as long as they prophesy. And they have the power to turn the rivers and oceans into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish.<br>
<br>
(When they complete their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss, or, the underworld, will declare war against them,)<br>
7 When they complete their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the bottomless pit will declare war against them, and he will conquer them and kill them.<br>
8 And their bodies will lie in the main street of (the great city) Jerusalem, the city that is figuratively called "Sodom" and "Egypt," the city where their Lord was crucified.<br>
9 And for three and a half days, all peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will stare at their bodies. No one will be allowed to bury them.<br>
10 All the people who belong to this world will gloat over them and give presents to each other to celebrate the death of the two prophets who had tormented them.<br>
11 But after three and a half days, God breathed life into them, and they stood up! Terror struck all who were staring at them.<br>
12 Then a loud voice from heaven called to the two prophets, "Come up here!" And they rose to heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched.<br>
13 At the same time there was a terrible earthquake that destroyed a tenth of the city. Seven thousand people died in that earthquake, and everyone else was terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.<br>
14 The second terror is past, but look, the third terror is coming quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What brought us here was the measuring of the temple in Revelation 11:2.<br>
<br>
Revelation 11:2 (KJV)<br>
But the court which is without the temple (cast out and) leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.<br>
<br>
That word there, that says, Gentiles...<br>
Gentiles are<br>
the nations, heathen world,<br>
foreign (non-Jewish, usually, by implication, pagan)<br>
<br>
Commentary: If we go to the place known today as the Temple Mount, and measure the area, we do not measure the area given unto the Gentiles.<br>
At this area today sits a yellow building with a big yellow dome on its roof.<br>
We could thus say that the yellow building is heathen, foreign, non-Jewish, and pagan.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's now go to the very popular verse that talks about tithes.<br>
<br>
Malachi 3:10 (KJV)<br>
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.<br>
<br>
What are tithes, and what is a storehouse?<br>
<br>
Let's take a quick look at these words, using our usual reference materials, which, of course, includes the Strong's concordance.<br>
<br>
tithes<br>
a tenth, a tenth part, payment of a tenth part, which would be ten per cent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
storehouse<br>
a depository<br>
an armoury, cellar, garner, the store (store-house), the treasure (treasure-house), treasury<br>
store<br>
supplies of food or drink<br>
magazine of weapons, God's armoury<br>
Can also be used to talk about storehouses of God, where the rain, snow, hail, the wind, and the sea are stored.<br>
May also be known as chambers in the book of Enoch.<br>
<br>
and the Hebrew word that gets translated into meat, is a word that generally refers to prey, food, and leaf.<br>
So, that can mean, prey as in animals caught and stored for food, food in general, including bread, seeds and grains, and foods harvested from plants and trees that have leaves on them, like fruits and vegetables, nuts and herbs and such.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Malachi 2:17 (KJV) - The last verse at the end of Chapter 2<br>
and we keep reading into Chapter 3, until we get to<br>
Malachi 3:12 (KJV)<br>
2:17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgement?<br>
3:1 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
3:2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:<br>
3:3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.<br>
3:4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former (ancient) years.<br>
3:5 And I will come near to you to judgement; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress (or defraud) the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
3:6 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.<br>
3:7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?<br>
3:8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.<br>
3:9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.<br>
3:10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, (and empty out a blessing) and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.<br>
3:11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground (or corrupt the fruits of your ground); neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
3:12 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Malachi 2:17 (NLT) - The last verse at the end of Chapter 2<br>
and we keep reading into Chapter 3, until we get to<br>
Malachi 3:12 (NLT)<br>
17 You have wearied the Lord with your words.<br>
"How have we wearied him?" you ask.<br>
You have wearied him by saying that all who do evil are good in the Lord's sight, and he is pleased with them. You have wearied him by asking, "Where is the God of justice?"<br>
1 "Look! I am sending my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. Then the Lord you are seeking will suddenly come to his Temple. The messenger of the covenant, whom you look for so eagerly, is surely coming," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
2 "But who will be able to endure it when he comes? Who will be able to stand and face him when he appears? For he will be like a blazing fire that refines metal, or like a strong soap that bleaches clothes.<br>
3 He will sit like a refiner of silver, burning away the dross. He will purify the Levites, refining them like gold and silver, so that they may once again offer acceptable sacrifices to the Lord.<br>
4 Then once more the Lord will accept the offerings brought to him by the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as he did in the past.<br>
5 "At that time I will put you on trial. I am eager to witness against all sorcerers and adulterers and liars. I will speak against those who cheat employees of their wages, who oppress widows and orphans, or who deprive the foreigners living amongst you of justice, for these people do not fear me," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
6 "I am the Lord, and I do not change. That is why you descendants of Jacob are not already destroyed.<br>
7 Ever since the days of your ancestors, you have scorned my decrees and failed to obey them. Now return to me, and I will return to you," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
"But you ask, 'How can we return when we have never gone away?'<br>
8<br>
"Should people cheat God? Yet you have cheated me!<br>
"But you ask, 'What do you mean? When did we ever cheat you?'<br>
"You have cheated me of the tithes and offerings due to me.<br>
9<br>
You are under a curse, for your whole nation has been cheating me.<br>
10 Bring all the tithes into the storehouse so there will be enough food in my Temple. If you do," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies, "I will open the windows of heaven for you. I will pour out a blessing so great you won't have enough room to take it in! Try it! Put me to the test!<br>
11 Your crops will be abundant, for I will guard them from insects and disease.<br>
(Your crops will be abundant, for I will guard them from the devourer.)<br>
Your grapes will not fall from the vine before they are ripe," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
12 "Then all nations will call you blessed, for your land will be such a delight," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Malachi 2:17 is pointing to a kind of message, a false message, that churches preach even to this day...<br>
<br>
Malachi 2:17 (NLT)<br>
You have wearied the Lord with your words. "How have we wearied him?" you ask. You have wearied him by saying that all who do evil are good in the Lord's sight, and he is pleased with them. You have wearied him by asking, "Where is the God of justice?"<br>
<br>
(Malachi) 2:17 (TS2009)<br>
You have wearied Yaw-Who-Wah with your words, and you have said, "In what way have we wearied Him?" In that you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the eyes of Yaw-Who-Wah, and He is delighting in them," or, "Where is the ELL-Low-Heem of right-ruling?"<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Many churches teach and preach that, Jesus Loves You, and just believe and have faith,<br>
but they refuse to teach that, having the Fear of the Lord means that you are to hate sin, not accept sin and tolerate sin.<br>
Many churches refuse to teach and preach about the need to repent, change direction, make a U-Turn with your life, and stop sinning.<br>
Many may also murmur and complain about all of the Satanic activities in the world, and all of the matters in the world that are unfair and unjust.<br>
We have wearied Yaw-Who-Wah with our attitudes and mindsets that creep in from these two issues.<br>
The two issues are,<br>
not teaching about repentance and commandment obedience, and<br>
questioning God's authority, questioning God's awareness and even His presence or actual existence because of the present-day Satanic activities, and the unfair injustices.<br>
The mask, the injections, the empty shelves at the store, the bills and the prices getting higher, and our wages getting lower, and on and on the list goes.<br>
Where is the God of justice? Asking that question, questioning Him like that, it wearies Him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's now look at how tithing is something that is submitted to the temple...<br>
<br>
But they did not technically take it to the temple, they took it to the storehouse.<br>
Where is the storehouse, the treasuries?<br>
<br>
Here are some things that we may begin to see in the Bible verses that we are about to read...<br>
So, the first ten per cent of your income should be placed into storage.<br>
If you can't store it all, then sell it and save the money, as tithe money, and give the tithe money to the temple.<br>
Don't save the tithe money longer than three years, because the people that work in the temple depend on it.<br>
Is that something we should do today?<br>
Should we tithe?<br>
Yes. Leviticus 27 gives us the commandment to tithe.<br>
The commandment to tithe is given before the temple existed.<br>
These verses here tell us that the tithe belongs to the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah, but it does not say what to do with it, and it does not say to whom or to where it should be given or submitted to.<br>
The actual temple did not yet exist, other than a tent of meeting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 27: 30-34 (KJV)<br>
27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy unto the LORD.<br>
27:31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.<br>
27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.<br>
27:33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.<br>
27:34 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leviticus 27: 30-34 (NLT)<br>
30 "One-tenth of the produce of the land, whether grain from the fields or fruit from the trees, belongs to the Lord and must be set apart to him as holy.<br>
31 If you want to buy back the Lord's tenth of the grain or fruit, you must pay its value, plus 20 per cent.<br>
32 Count off every tenth animal from your herds and flocks and set them apart for the Lord as holy.<br>
33 You may not pick and choose between good and bad animals, and you may not substitute one for another. But if you do exchange one animal for another, then both the original animal and its substitute will be considered holy and cannot be bought back."<br>
34 These are the commands that the Lord gave through Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Deuteronomy 15, the temple also did not yet exist, other than there being a tent of meeting, or tabernacle.<br>
Again, we are given the commandment to tithe, but this time we have some information about what to do with it.<br>
It is to be taken to the location where the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah chooses.<br>
This place is a place that is holy, it is a place where He sets His Name there,<br>
it is a location that He has chosen and that He has blessed.<br>
Now, especially in the NLT, we will see something very interesting.<br>
You save the tithe, you put it into storage.<br>
You sell it and keep the money.  We will call it tithe money.<br>
You take the tithe money to the location where you will feast, and you spend the tithe money on yourself and your household, to buy food for you and your family, your household, to buy food for the feast.<br>
The Levites ran the tent of meeting, and helped do all the offerings and sacrifices, and later would operate the temple.<br>
Let's take a look at this right now in the book of Deuteronomy, in chapters 14 and 15.<br>
<br>
Let's start reading at Deuteronomy 14:21 (KJV)<br>
and we keep on reading into the next chapter,<br>
stopping when we get to Deuteronomy 15:11 (KJV)<br>
14:21 Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.<br>
14:22 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.<br>
14:23 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.<br>
14:24 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:<br>
14:25 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:<br>
<br>
14:26 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, (or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee:) or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,<br>
14:27 And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.<br>
14:28 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:<br>
14:29 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.<br>
15:1 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.<br>
<br>
15:2 And this is the manner of the release:<br>
(Every master of the lending of his hand unto his neighbour shall release it;)<br>
Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD'S release.<br>
15:3 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;<br>
(To the end that there be no poor amongst you)<br>
15:4 Save when there shall be no poor amongst you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:<br>
15:5 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.<br>
15:6 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.<br>
15:7 If there be amongst you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:<br>
15:8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.<br>
(Beware that there be not a word in thy Belial heart,)<br>
15:9 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.<br>
15:10 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.<br>
15:11 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's see what NLT does here.<br>
Again, we start reading at Deuteronomy 14:21 (NLT)<br>
and we keep on reading into the next chapter,<br>
stopping when we get to Deuteronomy 15:11 (NLT)<br>
21 "You must not eat anything that has died a natural death. You may give it to a foreigner living in your town, or you may sell it to a stranger. But do not eat it yourselves, for you are set apart as holy to the Lord your God.<br>
"You must not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.<br>
22 "You must set aside a tithe of your crops -- one-tenth of all the crops you harvest each year.<br>
23 Bring this tithe to the designated place of worship -- the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honoured -- and eat it there in his presence. This applies to your tithes of grain, new wine, olive oil, and the firstborn males of your flocks and herds. Doing this will teach you always to fear the Lord your God.<br>
24 "Now when the Lord your God blesses you with a good harvest, the place of worship he chooses for his name to be honoured might be too far for you to bring the tithe.<br>
25 If so, you may sell the tithe portion of your crops and herds, put the money in a pouch, and go to the place the Lord your God has chosen.<br>
26 When you arrive, you may use the money to buy any kind of food you want -- cattle, sheep, goats, wine, or other alcoholic drink. Then feast there in the presence of the Lord your God and celebrate with your household.<br>
27 And do not neglect the Levites in your town, for they will receive no allotment of land amongst you.<br>
28 "At the end of every third year, bring the entire tithe of that year's harvest and store it in the nearest town.<br>
29 Give it to the Levites, who will receive no allotment of land amongst you, as well as to the foreigners living amongst you, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, so they can eat and be satisfied. Then the Lord your God will bless you in all your work.<br>
1 "At the end of every seventh year you must cancel the debts of everyone who owes you money.<br>
2 This is how it must be done. Everyone must cancel the loans they have made to their fellow Israelites. They must not demand payment from their neighbours or relatives, for the Lord's time of release has arrived.<br>
3 This release from debt, however, applies only to your fellow Israelites -- not to the foreigners living amongst you.<br>
4 "There should be no poor amongst you, for the Lord your God will greatly bless you in the land he is giving you as a special possession.<br>
5 You will receive this blessing if you are careful to obey all the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today.<br>
6 The Lord your God will bless you as he has promised. You will lend money to many nations but will never need to borrow. You will rule many nations, but they will not rule over you.<br>
7 "But if there are any poor Israelites in your towns when you arrive in the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted toward them.<br>
8 Instead, be generous and lend them whatever they need.<br>
9 Do not be mean-spirited and refuse someone a loan because the year for cancelling debts is close at hand. If you refuse to make the loan and the needy person cries out to the Lord, you will be considered guilty of sin.<br>
10 Give generously to the poor, not grudgingly, for the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.<br>
11 There will always be some in the land who are poor. That is why I am commanding you to share freely with the poor and with other Israelites in need.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, if we try to summarise all of that...<br>
Tithe.<br>
Save the tithe money for spending on food for one of the Lord's seven feasts, or when you gather together and feast together in a fellowship meal.<br>
When you gather together in a solemn assembly of fellow believers, use your tithe money to buy the food for your family.<br>
Give to the Levites.<br>
Give generously to the poor. None of the fellow believers should be poor. We have here a commandment that commands us to make sure none of the fellowship believers are poor.<br>
We will receive a blessing if we obey all of these commandments.<br>
We are to share and give to the poor, especially the fellowship believers.<br>
Any debt owed to a fellowship believer must be forgiven, cancelled, cleared, erased and deleted once the debt is more than seven years old.<br>
Every three years, all of the tithe is given to the Levites, and is also given to the foreigners living amongst you, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, so they can eat and be satisfied.<br>
So far, we do not see anything about giving this to a church.<br>
It goes to yourself and your family for having food for doing one of the Lord's feasts and fellowship meals.<br>
It is used to help the Levites, the poor, the foreigners living amongst you, the orphans, and the widows.<br>
Every three years the tithe of that year goes into some kind of local, community central storage facility or storehouse of some kind.<br>
From that central storage unit facility location, it is given to the Levites, the poor, the foreigners living amongst you, the orphans, and the widows.<br>
The foreigners? Those are the Gentiles, the heathen, the nations, the people living amongst you.<br>
That's everyone. All nations and people. Israel, non-Hebrew people, descendants of Abraham, those of foreign nations, the Gentiles.<br>
That Hebrew word being used right there can be used to identify all of those nations that we have just described.<br>
Since the Levites had the full time job of operating the tent of meeting, or tabernacle, and later, they operated and ran the temple building, they should also have tithe given to them, because that is their only source of income.<br>
They got their food from the tithe, the sacrifices and offerings brought to the temple.<br>
That's seems to be the part where we later get the idea of tithing to a church building, and the people that run the church building.<br>
But, as we can see, there is so much more to it than just that.<br>
<br>
Again, there was no temple building when this commandment to tithe was given.<br>
In the book of Malachi, he talks about a storehouse.<br>
We do see something in what we just read in the NLT...<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 14:28 (NLT)<br>
"At the end of every third year, bring the entire tithe of that year's harvest and store it in the nearest town.<br>
<br>
That would cause there to be a need of some kind of storehouse. That Hebrew word also gets translated into the word, Chamber.<br>
You may really see it be the word, chamber, in the book of Enoch, depending on which English translation you read.<br>
We really see the need of the tithe having a storehouse or storage building in 2 Chronicles.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the book of 2 Chronicles,<br>
we see moments when one king is disobedient, and another king decides to be obedient again,<br>
and there is this going back and forth between different kings.<br>
In chapter 28,<br>
Ahaz Rules in Judah, and he did not do what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, as his ancestor David had done.<br>
Ahaz Closes the Temple. Then, the next king,<br>
Hezekiah Rules in Judah, and he did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight, just as his ancestor David had done.<br>
Hezekiah Reopens the Temple in chapter 29, and we read in there about The Temple Rededication.<br>
They start doing the feasts again, and we see them doing the Celebration of Passover in chapter 30.<br>
and that brings us to chapter 31.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 31 is where we see them decide to go back to doing tithes again,<br>
and with such a large amount coming in, being piled in heaps,<br>
that they decide to build chambers, or storehouses, as a place for storage of the tithes.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 31: 2-14 (KJV)<br>
31:2 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.<br>
31:3 He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.<br>
31:4 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.<br>
(And as soon as the commandment brought forth, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and dates,)<br>
31:5 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.<br>
<br>
31:6 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.<br>
(The Hebrew wording at the end of verse 6 literally says, and laid them heaps heaps.)<br>
<br>
31:7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.<br>
31:8 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.<br>
31:9 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.<br>
31:10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.<br>
(Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare storehouses in the house of the LORD;)<br>
31:11 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,<br>
31:12 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.<br>
31:13 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.<br>
31:14 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We will again start reading at<br>
2 Chronicles 31:2 (NLT)<br>
and we keep reading this time until we get to the first verse of the next chapter.<br>
stopping at 2 Chronicles 32:1 (NLT)<br>
2 Hezekiah then organised the priests and Levites into divisions to offer the burnt offerings and peace offerings, and to worship and give thanks and praise to the Lord at the gates of the Temple.<br>
3 The king also made a personal contribution of animals for the daily morning and evening burnt offerings, the weekly Sabbath festivals, the monthly new moon festivals, and the annual festivals as prescribed in the Law of the Lord.<br>
4 In addition, he required the people in Jerusalem to bring a portion of their goods to the priests and Levites, so they could devote themselves fully to the Law of the Lord.<br>
5 When the people of Israel heard these requirements, they responded generously by bringing the first share of their grain, new wine, olive oil, honey, and all the produce of their fields. They brought a large quantity -- a tithe of all they produced.<br>
6 The people who had moved to Judah from Israel, and the people of Judah themselves, brought in the tithes of their cattle, sheep, and goats and a tithe of the things that had been dedicated to the Lord their God, and they piled them up in great heaps.<br>
7 They began piling them up in late spring, and the heaps continued to grow until early autumn.<br>
8 When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw these huge piles, they thanked the Lord and his people Israel!<br>
9 "Where did all this come from?" Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites.<br>
10 And Azariah the high priest, from the family of Zadok, replied, "Since the people began bringing their gifts to the Lord's Temple, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare. The Lord has blessed his people, and all this is left over."<br>
11 Hezekiah ordered that storerooms be prepared in the Temple of the Lord. When this was done,<br>
12 the people faithfully brought all the gifts, tithes, and other items dedicated for use in the Temple. Conaniah the Levite was put in charge, assisted by his brother Shimei.<br>
13 The supervisors under them were Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath, and Benaiah. These appointments were made by King Hezekiah and Azariah, the chief official in the Temple of God.<br>
14 Kore son of Imnah the Levite, who was the gatekeeper at the East Gate, was put in charge of distributing the voluntary offerings given to God, the gifts, and the things that had been dedicated to the Lord.<br>
15 His faithful assistants were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah. They distributed the gifts amongst the families of priests in their towns by their divisions, dividing the gifts fairly amongst old and young alike.<br>
16 They distributed the gifts to all males three years old or older, regardless of their place in the genealogical records. The distribution went to all who would come to the Lord's Temple to perform their daily duties according to their divisions.<br>
17 They distributed gifts to the priests who were listed by their families in the genealogical records, and to the Levites twenty years old or older who were listed according to their jobs and their divisions.<br>
18 Food allotments were also given to the families of all those listed in the genealogical records, including their little babies, wives, sons, and daughters. For they had all been faithful in purifying themselves.<br>
19 As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who were living in the open villages around the towns, men were appointed by name to distribute portions to every male amongst the priests and to all the Levites listed in the genealogical records.<br>
20 In this way, King Hezekiah handled the distribution throughout all Judah, doing what was pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord his God.<br>
21 In all that he did in the service of the Temple of God and in his efforts to follow God's laws and commands, Hezekiah sought his God wholeheartedly. As a result, he was very successful.<br>
1 After Hezekiah had faithfully carried out this work, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified towns, giving orders for his army to break through their walls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Here is another example of bad stuff happening to people even when they did not do anything wrong.<br>
King Hezekiah tries to do his very best to follow God's laws and commands, doing what was pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord his God.<br>
Hezekiah sought his God wholeheartedly. As a result, he was very successful.<br>
And with all of that good going on, as soon as we go the very next chapter, instant war and trouble, as Assyria Invades Judah.<br>
Well, the story goes on from there, in this book and in other books in your Bible and in books that are not in your Bible, but you can at least see that, even when you do all of this Bible stuff perfectly right, it does not guarantee that some days of trouble, stress and battles of one kind or another, will come along, even if you try your best to do and obey the commandments in your Bible.<br>
Even King Hezekiah, great as he was, makes a stupid mistake later on in life, giving a prideful, grand tour of all his riches to some Babylon spies, showing the spies why it would be really good for them to attack and invade his land.<br>
The spies called themselves, ambassadors.<br>
There are other books in your Bible that tell this story in greater detail.<br>
There are some other books that are not in your Bible anymore that also provide details about the story of King Hezekiah, including some material that King Hezekiah wrote himself.<br>
We only get a little snip about this story in this book of 2 Chronicles.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 32: 24 & 25 (NLT)<br>
24 ...Hezekiah became deathly ill. He prayed to the Lord, who healed him and gave him a miraculous sign.<br>
25 But Hezekiah did not respond appropriately to the kindness shown him, and he became proud. So the Lord's anger came against him and against Judah and Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
2 Chronicles 32:31 (NLT)<br>
...when ambassadors arrived from Babylon to ask about the remarkable events that had taken place in the land, God withdrew from Hezekiah in order to test him and to see what was really in his heart.<br>
<br>
And guess what nation shows up later to invade Judah? Babylon. What a surprise.<br>
<br>
Let's now go back to our study about tithes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Here is another Summary of some more things that we have learnt so far.<br>
Looking at all of this, and trying to ascertain the heart of the Lord in all of this.<br>
Tithe. Yes, we Tithe.<br>
Tithe first, and he will show you later where to send or submit the tithe.<br>
Put it in storage.<br>
If there is too much to store, sell it and save the money.<br>
(I would recommend not keeping it in a bank, and not keeping it stored in an electronic form, but it should be a physical form of money that you can save and touch and physically possess and control without the need for electricity or some kind of internet connection.)<br>
(If the electricity goes down, and your phone stops working, and there is no internet service, can you still access and touch and use your money?)<br>
The Lord will show you when and where to submit and give the tithe.<br>
Do not keep the tithe longer than three years.<br>
Every three years the tithe was gathered into a central storage facility.<br>
Again, tithe is given to the Levites, the poor, the foreigners living amongst you, the orphans, and the widows.<br>
Tithe money is for you to use to buy food for the the Lord's feasts and fellowship meals, when fellowship believers gather together and feast together, whether or not it is or is not one of the seven feasts.<br>
Tithe and Tithe money is especially used to help support those that run and operate the gathering place that the Lord has chosen for his people to gather at.<br>
If a believer owes you a debt, forgive and release the debt after seven years.<br>
With everyone doing the tithe and debt forgiveness, there should not be anyone poor amongst the believers.<br>
Some people say that the tithe was only for the temple, and the temple no longer exists, but that is not what we just saw in the scriptures.<br>
Let's think about this temple building, what it was, what happened to the building, and would be the "temple" today.<br>
If your own body is the temple, and the body of believers is the temple, we should still tithe to this temple as it is today.<br>
You are the temple today. We are. The group of believers gathering together in a solemn assembly is the body, and the body is the temple today.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 13:2 (NLT)<br>
Jesus replied, "Yes, look at these great buildings. But they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!"<br>
<br>
Luke 21:6 (NLT)<br>
"The time is coming when all these things will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!"<br>
<br>
Matthew 24:2 (NLT)<br>
But he responded, "Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!"<br>
<br>
At the website, Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopaedia, let's gather some information about the Temple Mount.<br>
Here are some selected details, all being quoted from this webpage...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount</a><br>
<br>
Here are some things that were found on that webpage, back in October 2022.<br>
<br>
The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism.<br>
According to Jewish tradition and scripture, the First Temple was built by King Solomon, the son of King David, in 957 BC,<br>
and was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BC.<br>
As no scientific excavations have ever been conducted on the site, no archaeological evidence has been found to verify this.<br>
The Second Temple was constructed under the auspices of Zerubbabel in 516 BC,<br>
was renovated by King Herod, and was destroyed by the Roman Empire in 70 AD.<br>
Orthodox Jewish tradition maintains it is here that the third and final Temple will be built when the Messiah comes.<br>
The Temple Mount is the place Jews turn towards during prayer.<br>
Jewish attitudes towards entering the site vary. Due to its extreme sanctity, many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself,<br>
to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the Holy of Holies stood, since, according to (not in the Bible) rabbinical law, there is still some aspect of the divine presence at the site.<br>
<br>
In October 2022, there was also found some commentary from a sermon by Ray Stedman.<br>
<br>
Ray Stedman was born in the year 1917, and he passed away in 1992.<br>
Ray Stedman was an evangelical Christian pastor, and author of several books.<br>
After working with J. Vernon McGee, he became a pastor in 1950, and went to<br>
The San Francisco Bay Area, to the city of Palo Alto, California,<br>
and it was there at Peninsula Bible Church, that Ray Stedman was a pastor there for 40 years.<br>
<br>
We will now read a selected portion from the Ray Stedman Ministries webpage as it was in October of 2022.<br>
The webpage was found at...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.raystedman.org/new-testament/matthew/the-long-look-ahead">https://www.raystedman.org/new-testament/matthew/the-long-look-ahead</a><br>
<br>
From the series, What on Earth's Going To Happen, Olivet Discourse,<br>
This quoted material is from the sermon, titled, The Long Look Ahead.<br>
Ray C. Stedman is the author of this Message transcript and recording<br>
that was first published on 01 January 1970.<br>
And is made available on the webpage mentioned previously,<br>
by Ray Stedman Ministries,<br>
<br>
Here is a quotation from this Message transcript...<br>
(Some Dictionary word definitions are inserted in round brackets.)
<br>
So Jesus predicts the downfall of the Temple in the near future as a sign that all else he includes in this discourse is true. This is what lay behind the request of the disciples for a sign associated with his coming.<br>
<br>
In Luke 21:20, we have other details of this predicted overthrow of the city and the Temple.<br>
There Jesus adds, "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near." Forty years later, the Roman armies under Titus came in and fulfilled the prediction to the very letter.<br>
With Titus was a Jewish historian named Josephus who recorded the terrible story in minute detail.<br>
It was one of the most ghastly sieges in all history.<br>
When the Romans came the city was divided amongst three warring factions of Jews, who were so at each others' throats that they paid no heed to the approach of the Romans.<br>
Thus, Titus came up and surrounded the city whilst it was distracted by its own internecine warfare.<br>
(They were too distracted fighting amongst themselves to notice the attack.)<br>
The Romans assaulted the walls again and again, and gave every opportunity to the Jews to surrender and save their capital destruction.<br>
<br>
During the long siege a terrible famine raged in the city and the bodies of the inhabitants of the city were literally stacked like cordwood in the streets.<br>
Mothers ate their own children to preserve their own strength. The toll of Jewish suffering was horrible but they would not surrender the city.<br>
Again and again they attempted to trick the Romans through guile and perfidy (disloyalty, betraying the Romans). When at last the walls were breached Titus tried to preserve the Temple by giving orders to his soldiers not to destroy or burn it.<br>
But the anger of the soldiers against the Jews was so intense that, maddened by the resistance they encountered, they disobeyed the order of their general and set fire to the temple. There were great quantities of gold and silver which had been placed in the Temple for safekeeping.<br>
This melted and ran down between the rocks and into the cracks of the stones that formed the Temple and the wall around it. When the Roman soldiers finally took the city, in their greed to obtain this gold and silver, they took long bars and pried apart these massive stones.<br>
Thus, quite literally, not one stone was left standing upon another. The Temple itself was totally destroyed though the wall supporting the area upon which the Temple was built was left partially intact and a portion of it remains to this day, called the Western Wall.<br>
<br>
And that is the end of the words quoted from the 1970 Message transcript, The Long Look Ahead, by Ray Stedman Ministries.<br>
<br>
Commentary: This quote points a book written by Josephus.<br>
Josephus is mainly known for writing two books. One is titled, The Jewish War, published in the year 75 AD, and the other book is titled, Antiquities of the Jews, published in the year 93 or 94 AD.<br>
There is an argument about the factual truthfulness of this story, about the gold melting into the stones making them want to literally disassemble the temple so completly so that not one stone was not left on top of another.<br>
Some who have tried to verify this and research this out, by finding physical evidence or other solid historical documentation,<br>
have concluded that there is no solid evidence or historical documented facts that can verify or prove all of the details that Ray Stedman describes to us here in his 1970 sermon.<br>
It's an interesting story, but we can't really seem to prove if these details are really historically true.<br>
<br>
The fact is this:<br>
The temple was destroyed by the Roman Empire in the year 70 AD.<br>
<br>
The commandment to tithe was to submit your tithe to the temple?<br>
The temple was destroyed in the the year 70 AD, and was never rebuilt.<br>
So, you cannot send your tithe to the temple, and the temple's storehouse, in Jerusalem, because it does not exist anymore.<br>
The temple and its storehouse did exist when the book of Malachi was written.<br>
<br>
Malachi does not say to tithe to the temple; he said, storehouse.<br>
So, the concept of tithing and storing the tithe in some kind of storage facility, storage room, storage unit, storage building, storage house or storehouse, is seen there in the book of Malachi,<br>
but it does not say where or which one.<br>
It does not say that it was only for the temple in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Back in 2 Chronicles 31, we saw, in the KJV and in the NLT, that the king had them do this...<br>
<br>
prepare chambers in the house of the LORD;<br>
prepare storehouses in the house of the LORD;<br>
storerooms be prepared in the Temple of the Lord.<br>
The Hebrew word that is being used there for house or Temple, that word can have a few different meanings.<br>
Let's insert those various meanings into the sentence.<br>
<br>
the house of the LORD Yaw-Who-Wah; can also be...<br>
<br>
the temple of the LORD;<br>
the body of the LORD;<br>
the place of the LORD;<br>
the family of the LORD;<br>
household, family<br>
those belonging to the same household<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 6:19 (KJV)<br>
What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 6:19 (NLT)<br>
Don't you realise that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself,<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3:16 (KJV)<br>
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 3:16 (NLT)<br>
Don't you realise that all of you together are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God lives in you?<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2:21 (KJV)<br>
in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2:21 (NLT)<br>
We are carefully joined together in him, becoming a holy temple for the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The tithe is for the temple, and the temple still exists today. You are the temple! We are the temple! Your family of fellowship beleivers are all part of this temple that still exists today!<br>
The church body of fellowship believers is the temple. The Hebrew word for temple also means, house and family.<br>
Church body, church temple, church family, same thing.<br>

(Withhold not good from them the owners thereof, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.)<br>

<br>
Proverbs 3: 27 & 28 (NLT)<br>
27<br>
Do not withhold good from those who deserve it<br>
when it's in your power to help them.<br>
28<br>
If you can help your neighbour now, don't say,<br>
"Come back tomorrow, and then I'll help you."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In conclusion, we can see that tithing is a commandment, and was not just for one certain temple in one certain city, a temple that no longer exists.<br>
The tithe was for us, to buy us food to eat at our next time of gathering together, at the gathering location that Yaw-Who-Wah chooses, where He has us gather together and have a feast together, whether just another weekly gathering, or one of the seven feasts.<br>
First priority is to make sure the tithe goes to those that work or volunteer to help at the gathering location,<br>
It can not be just a coincidence that the command to tithe is right next to the commandment to give generously in order to make sure that no one is allowed to be poor amongst the fellowship of believers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bring this tithe to the designated place of worship -- the place the Lord your God chooses for his name to be honoured.<br>
Use your tithe money to buy food to eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there.<br>
Go to the place the Lord your God has chosen.<br>
<br>
Again, the storehouse is<br>
your own personal storage unit or storage room, or, a storeroom or storage room placed inside the place where the fellowship believers gather together.<br>
<br>
<br>
Churches never want to teach you the secret of how to fellowship because the churches would not get your money if you knew how to fellowship without them.<br>
Fellowship requires communication between believers and those believers sharing their needs.<br>
We need to communicate our list of needs so that we know how to share and help those who have need.<br>
<br>
The Book of Acts, the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 2: verses 44 and 45 (NLT)<br>
44 And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had.<br>
45 They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Could you imagine the pastor of a mega-church ever making this announcement?<br>
I have decided to sell my home and live in a spare room in the back of the church, using all of that money from selling my house, to help those of you in need, to help you pay your rent and your bills, so you don't have to be without food and heat, and so you don't have to be evicted and homeless and hungry.<br>
We have decided to sell our family campground beach property and use all of that money to help those of you in need, to help you pay your rent and your bills, so you don't have to be without food and heat, and so you don't have to be evicted and homeless and hungry.<br>
We have decided to take half of our empty car park, our parking lot, which is bigger than the car park or parking lot at the shopping mall, and sell half of that land, and use all of that money to help those of you in need, to help you pay your rent and your bills, so you don't have to be without food and heat, and so you don't have to be evicted and homeless and hungry.<br>
<br>
What do we see instead?  Pastors demanding to buy their own private jet.<br>
<br>
Pastors travelling around, blowing their money on airfare, plane tickets, hiring cars, car rentals, taxis, expensive restaurants, hotels, travelling around, filling their car with petrol or gasoline, whilst the people going to their church find out what it's like to sleep in their car each night.<br>
<br>
I am not making this up! In 2018 and 2019, it was in the news that televangelist, Kenneth Copeland must have a fifty-four million dollar private jet, and Jesse Duplantis needed four of those jets, to do their job as a pastor.<br>
$54 million dollars multiplied five times or more.<br>
In October of 2022, that would be almost £49 million British pounds. Times that by five.<br>
That comes to $270 million dollars, or £245 million pounds.<br>
How many meals would that buy? How many hungry, homeless children have those private jets flown over since 2018?<br>
<br>
The tithe does not go into a basket, it does not go into a carpet bag, or cloth sack, it does not go into a pretty metal dish or a wooden tray, it does not go into a box,<br>
it goes to a person or it goes into a storehouse or storage room.<br>
The tithe is used to buy food for yourself and your family to eat at the next fellowship gathering assembly location.<br>
It is used to buy food to share and give to others at the next feast or fellowship gathering assembly location.<br>
The people that run, operate and maintain the fellowship gathering assembly location need the giving of tithes.<br>
The poor, the hungry, the widows and the orphans need the giving of tithes.<br>
Should you use the tithe for yourself, your family, another person, or put it into a storehouse?<br>
May the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah give us direction and wisdom on how to properly direct the tithe to the person or place where He tells us to send it, according to His perfect will.<br>
<br>
<br>
We will now end this study with a prayer. Let us pray.<br>
<br>
Dear Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, I confess that, in the past, I have not done tithing, and the thought of tithing was just not really on my mind. And, there are times even very recently when many of us are very poor, and it sounds fearful and scary to set aside ten per cent of our income to do this tithe.<br>
<br>
But you promise a blessing if we do tithe. Help us set aside the tithe and help us save and store the tithe, even if it only is used to help us buy our own food for the next time we gather together as a group of fellowship believers. May with learn to faithfully tithe, even if that fellowship is just my family, and our gathering together is just going to be this next Saturday Sabbath day of rest. May we save or give the tithe according to your directions and your perfect will. Cast out the fear of doing the tithe and the fear of obeying your commandments.  Enter into us and fill us with your Spirit that is Holy, so we can have the power and the ability to delightfully obey all of your commandments, all of your Torah, because you live inside of us, making our hearts your forever home.<br> 
<br>
Help us learn how to tithe, how to accomplish the definition of fellowship, how to pray for one another, how to actively and honestly communicate with one another, and help us generously give to one another, making sure that we help each other with our lists of needs. We will all have something to share and something to give if everyone in the fellowship were to obey this commandment to tithe and save and store the first ten per cent of our income, so that you can direct us on what to do with it, and, where it should go, and to whom it should go.<br>
<br>
Give us instruction, knowledge, direction and wisdom on saving and sharing the tithe, and to not be afraid about trusting in you and obeying your commandments.<br>
We thankfully receive your mercy, your grace and your forgiveness, in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main.<br>
