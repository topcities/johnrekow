This is an electronic version of a Christian Church Service. This is a Bible Study, where we study and learn about our Father in Heaven, our Dear Heavenly Father, Almighty, Holy God, Messiah, Lord, Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Because we study the entire Bible, including all of the Old Testament, and all of the New Testament, praying in the name of Jesus Christ, in the name of Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, Yeh-Shew-Uh, the following warning may be applicable on some occasions.<br>
<br>
Warning. Discretion is advised.<br>
The Bible verses that we read, and the comments and opinions shared, may not be appropriate for all audiences.<br>
Non-Christian audiences may be offended.<br>

Some content is intended only for mature Christians.<br>
Some of this content may sometimes be inappropriate, objectionable or offensive to non-Christians, or audiences of other religions.<br>
Some studies may possibly contain, mature subject matter, Adult Content, offensive content, sexually explicit content, and explicit content that may be disturbing or upsetting, especially for children and non-Christians.<br>
Some studies may contain opinions, comments and views that are in opposition to other religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
Warning!<br>
Some parts of the Bible contain mature subject matter, adult themes, strong adult content and sexual content that may not be suitable for young children.<br>
Some people may find Bible studies to be offensive, and those people may respond with legal persecutions, including lawsuits, or illegal, criminal actions.<br>
Caution. Christians meeting together, and gathering together as a group of people, Bible ownership, Bible reading, and Christian Church services may be illegal in certain areas, possibly resulting in arrest, torture, imprisonment or death.<br>
Some governments in some countries may have passed laws that make owning or reading a Bible to be illegal in certain places, and make take actions against those participants, resulting in prison, torture or death.<br>
Some of the content in a Bible study may contain Bible verse readings, quotations, commentaries, details and descriptions that may be considered graphic, sexually-explicit, disturbing or upsetting.<br>
<br>
This is an English Bible study, with readings from English Bibles.<br>
We may sometimes attempt to pray and speak the name of the Heavenly Father and His only begotten Son in the original, ancient Hebrew language.<br>
We usually like to read verses from the King James Version (KJV) (1611), and the fifth edition of the New Living Translation (NLT) (2015).<br>

<a name="JAH17GIDESUGGREAD"></a><h2>Gideon Prayer</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Gideon Prayer<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah had blessed me for many years with an amazing and loving family.<br>
One of our many favourite family moments, was when we spent a week going on holiday, in July of 2020, by enjoying a week along Oregon's sea side.<br>
The area is known as the Central Oregon Coast, and the week was very blessed, with many loving and peaceful memories and moments.<br>
<br>
It was almost strange how we got along so well, all week long. There were, of course, walks along the beach, the fresh ocean wind, the very bright, deep blue ocean waves, the continual roar of the sea, looking out at the Pacific Ocean as the sun would set, the seagulls, and going for walks in places that had little shops of souvenirs, and gifts of odds and ends.<br>
<br>
Each morning, we would enjoy a big, iced coffee with chocolate and caramel mixed in, and on one day, my wife and I were watching my daughter have a go at surfing down a big sand dune, we were all eating exotic flavours of ice cream, enjoying dozens of flavours of salt water taffy, having the freedom of driving and travelling in our van, as we pleased, and discovering hidden, old roads, with beautiful, purple flowers growing just right there and no place else.<br>
<br>
The scenes, the ocean views, the moments and the memories, were beautifully blessed and protected with massive amounts of love and peace.<br>
<br>
The Bible study we are about to begin, here, next, reminds me of this special time.<br>
<br>
One day, as we were exploring some small shops along the highway, we found ourselves in the area of downtown Newport, Oregon.  There was a used bookshop there, and so we popped in for a quick browse.<br>
<br>
I found a sparkly gold, hardcover Gideon's Bible.<br>
There was handwriting inside that indicated that it used to be in one of the hotel rooms at the Waldport Hotel. The city of Waldport is about 15 miles south of Newport, Oregon.<br>
<br>
There was an interesting study in the front of this Bible, and so, I seem to recall that they gave it to me for free, and by looking at the material found in this Bible, we now have the Bible study that we are about to begin right now.<br>
<br>
So, even though it is mainly just a good Bible study to enjoy here, this indirectly reminds me, personally, of that special week of being with my family, enjoying the Oregon Coast in July of 2020. In fact, many of these Bible studies are inspired by people and events of things learnt by the people and the situations that we have gone through over the years.<br>
<br>
So, let's begin. First of all, what is a Gideons Bible?  It is a Bible that is published by Gideons International.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Gideons International publishes a hardcover NKJV Bible that they distribute for free.<br>
<br>
They have made some extra pages to assist in locating some main topics and teachings in the Bible.<br>
<br>
One of them is very interesting, and would be a great tool for sending up a powerful prayer.<br>
<br>
That is what we will look at here shortly.<br>
<br>
Their operations are primarily in the United States.<br>
Their main website in the United States is at<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.gideons.org/">http://www.gideons.org/</a><br>
<br>
All of these extra pages were mainly known as Suggested Readings.<br>
<br>
All of the Suggested Readings content used to be easily available on their United States website that we just mentioned,<br>
Unfortunately, in September 2016, they re-designed the USA website and removed all of the Suggested Readings content.<br>
<br>
If the Suggested Readings content is not online, then, the only other way to access it would be to get your hands on a physical, hardcover, paper Bible book from The Gideons.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the Suggested Readings content is still online, but not on their main, United States website.<br>
<br>
In July 2020, we can find it still online, if we go to Ireland.<br>
<br>
The Gideons International (Ireland): Gideon Bible helps.<br>
You are not allowed to have spaces in a website address.<br>
So, each spacebar character has to be replaced with the code, per cent, two, zero, or, per cent, twenty, ( %20 ) to make the website address work.<br>
<br>
So, as of July 2020, if you want to read the Suggested Readings content online,<br>
you will find it at the following Gideons International website in Ireland...<br>
The dot I E, indicates that the website is in Ireland...<br>
<a href="http://gideons.ie/read%20the%20bible/helps.html">http://gideons.ie/read%20the%20bible/helps.html</a><br>
<br>
The only disappointment about the Gideons International website in Ireland,<br>
is that, instead of the New King James Version (NKJV) being quoted throughout the website, they instead quote from the<br>
English Standard Version 2016 (ESV) translation, which may not be a trusted and accurate translation.<br>
That translation is not recommended at this time, as of July 2020.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's learn a little bit more about Gideons International.<br>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia<br>
Gideons International is an evangelical Christian association founded in 1899 in Wisconsin. The Gideons' primary activity is distributing copies of the Bible free of charge.<br>
The association is most widely known for its Bibles placed in lodging rooms. The Gideons also distribute to hospitals and other medical offices, schools and colleges, military bases, as well as jails and prisons. The association takes its name from the Biblical figure Gideon depicted in the book of Judges 6.<br>
<br>
The Gideons began distributing free Bibles in 1908.<br>
As of July 2020, the headquarters of Gideons International is in Nashville, Tennessee.<br>
<br>
That information comes from Wikipedia.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many of the common places of lodging in the United States are known as motels and hotels. Traditionally, in the side table drawer next to the bed would be a hardcover Bible book.  It contained the NKJV of the Bible without any extra notes or footnotes.<br>
Many motels and hotels might still have this Bible in their rooms today.<br>
<br>
What made their NKJV Bible unique, besides their name in the corner of the front cover, was that they provided some additional pages of Bible study material at the beginning of the book, before the start of the actual NKJV Bible.  The pages basically covered various topics and subjects, and told where to go and read about those topics in the Bible.  It might reference the Bible verse and give the paper page number to turn to, and in some cases they even quoted the verse on the page.  The names of these extra pages may have had some variations over the years, and in different geographical areas of the world.  These extra pages were known as, Suggested Readings, and usually were divided into sections known as,<br>
<br>
Historical Highlights<br>
Spiritual Standards<br>
Dynamic Doctrines, and<br>
Practical Precepts.<br>
<br>
Here is the list of the Historical Highlights, along with a few of the Dynamic Doctrines added mainly at the end, to give you a sample of this material.<br>

The Last Judgement -- Revelation 20:10-15<br>
The New Heaven and New Earth -- Revelation 21 and 22<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In my opinion, I feel that the most interesting and most powerful page that The Gideons added, is on the very first paper page, inside the front cover.  It's called, Help in Time of Need.  It lists some main topics and a few Bible verses that you can read on those topics.  For example, the first item says, The Way of Salvation, and it suggests that you read John 14:6, Acts 16:31, and Romans 10:9.<br>
<br>
If we take this list, and not look at the suggested Bible verses, we come up with a list that would make for a very powerful prayer.  That is what we are going to do here in just a moment.  For now, take a look at this list without the suggested Bible verses.  Here is what it says,<br>
<br>
<br>
Help in Time of Need<br>
The Way of Salvation<br>
Comfort in Time of Loneliness<br>
Comfort in Time of Sorrow<br>
Relief in Time of Suffering<br>
Guidance in Time of Decision<br>
Protection in Time of Danger<br>
Courage in Time of Fear<br>
Peace in Time of Turmoil<br>
Rest in Time of Weariness<br>
Strength in Time of Temptation<br>
Warning in Time of Indifference<br>
Forgiveness in Time of Conviction<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What does the word, Indifference, mean?<br>
<br>
Indifference definitions from the<br>
Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English,<br>
the Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, and the<br>
Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary...<br>
Indifference is a<br>
lack of interest or concern<br>
lack of quality, lack of importance.<br>
lack of interest, feeling or reaction<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look at some Bible verses that talk and teach about these main points in this list.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14:6<br>
6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Comfort in Time of Loneliness<br>
<br>
Psalms 23: 3 & 4<br>
3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.<br>
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me;<br>
<br>
<br>
We just read Isaiah 41:10 just a moment ago. Let's look at it again.<br>
Isaiah 41: 9-11<br>
I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.<br>
10 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.<br>
11 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and (the men of thy strife shall perish,) they that strive with thee shall perish.<br>

Psalms 25:14-21 NLT<br>
14<br>
The Lord is a friend to those who fear him.<br>
He teaches them his covenant.<br>
15<br>
My eyes are always on the Lord,<br>
for he rescues me from the traps of my enemies.<br>

Turn to me and have mercy,<br>
for I am alone and in deep distress.<br>

My problems go from bad to worse.<br>
Oh, save me from them all!<br>
18<br>
Feel my pain and see my trouble.<br>
Forgive all my sins.<br>
19<br>
See how many enemies I have<br>
and how viciously they hate me!<br>

Protect me! Rescue my life from them!<br>
Do not let me be disgraced, for in you I take refuge.<br>

May integrity and honesty protect me,<br>
for I put my hope in you.<br>

Romans 8: 38 & 39<br>
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>

Comfort in Time of Sorrow<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 2-6<br>
2 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
3 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;<br>
4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.<br>
5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.<br>
6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.<br>
<br>
Relief in Time of Suffering<br>
2 Corinthians 12:8-10<br>
8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.<br>
9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br>
10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12:3-14 KJV<br>
3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.<br>
4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.<br>
5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:<br>
6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.<br>
7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?<br>
8 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.<br>
9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?<br>
10 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.<br>
11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.<br>
12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;<br>
13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.<br>
14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12:2-15 NLT<br>
<br>
(Instead of the joy awaiting him, he endured the cross, disregarding its shame.)<br>
...Because of the joy awaiting him, he endured the cross, disregarding its shame. Now he is seated in the place of honour beside God's throne.<br>
<br>
(Think of how people hurt themselves by opposing him; then you won't become weary and give up.)<br>
3 Think of all the hostility he endured from sinful people; then you won't become weary and give up.<br>
4 After all, you have not yet given your lives in your struggle against sin.<br>
5 And have you forgotten the encouraging words God spoke to you as his children? He said,<br>
"My child, don't make light of the Lord's discipline,<br>
and don't give up when he corrects you.<br>
6<br>
For the Lord disciplines those he loves,<br>
and he punishes each one he accepts as his child."<br>
(quoting from Proverbs 3: 11 & 12, Greek Version)<br>
7 As you endure this divine discipline, remember that God is treating you as his own children. Who ever heard of a child who is never disciplined by its father?<br>
8 If God doesn't discipline you as he does all of his children, it means that you are illegitimate and are not really his children at all.<br>
9 Since we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us, shouldn't we submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits, (and really live,) and live forever?<br>
10 For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how. But God's discipline is always good for us, so that we might share in his holiness.<br>
11 No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening -- it's painful! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.<br>
12 So take a new grip with your tired hands and strengthen your weak knees.<br>
13 Mark out a straight path for your feet so that those who are weak and lame will not fall but become strong.<br>
14 Work at living in peace with everyone, and work at living a holy life, for those who are not holy will not see the Lord.<br>
15 Look after each other so that none of you fails to receive the grace of God. Watch out that no poisonous root of bitterness grows up to trouble you, corrupting many.<br>

Protection in Time of Danger<br>
<br>
Psalms 91: 7-16 KJV<br>
7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.<br>
8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.<br>
9 Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;<br>
10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.<br>
11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.<br>
12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.<br>
13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder (thou shalt tread upon the lion and asp, or serpent): the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.<br>
14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.<br>
15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.<br>
16 With long life (with length of days) will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.<br>

Psalms 121: 7 & 8 KJV<br>

Courage in Time of Fear<br>
Hebrews 13:5-6<br>
5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.<br>

Ephesians 6:10-13 KJV<br>
10<br>
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.<br>
11<br>
Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.<br>
12<br>
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>
13<br>
Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<br>
<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
Ephesians 6: 10 - 19 NLT<br>
10 A final word: Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.<br>
11 Put on all of God's armour so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil.<br>
<br>
(For you are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies,)<br>
12 For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places.<br>
<br>
13 Therefore, put on every piece of God's armour so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm.<br>
14 Stand your ground, putting on the belt of truth and the body armour of God's righteousness.<br>
<br>
<br>
15 For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you will be fully prepared.<br>

16 In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil.<br>
(Hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the evil one.)<br>

17 Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<br>

(Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all of God's holy people.)<br>

19 And pray for me, too. Ask God to give me the right words so I can boldly explain God's mysterious plan that the Good News is for Jews and Gentiles alike.<br>

<br>
Philippians 4:7 KJV<br>

Rest in Time of Weariness<br>
Matthew 11:28-30 NLT<br>
28 Then Jesus said, "Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.<br>
29 Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls.<br>
30 For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light."<br>

Matthew 11:28 KJV<br>
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<br>

Strength in Time of Temptation<br>
1 Corinthians 10:13 KJV<br>
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 10:13 (NLT)<br>
The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure.<br>

Warning in Time of Indifference<br>
Jeremiah 25: 3-5 KJV<br>
...the word of the Lord hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.<br>
4 And the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.<br>
5 They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings....<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 25: 3-5 NLT<br>
...the Lord has been giving me his messages. I have faithfully passed them on to you, but you have not listened.<br>
4 "Again and again the Lord has sent you his servants, the prophets, but you have not listened or even paid attention.<br>
5 Each time the message was this: 'Turn from the evil road you are travelling and from the evil things you are doing....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Malachi 3:13 through Malachi 4:4 KJV<br>
13 Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?<br>
<br>
14 Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept (his observation,) his ordinance, and (that we have walked in black,) that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?<br>
<br>
15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, (they that work wickedness are built;)<br>
<br>
they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.<br>
<br>
<br>
16 Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.<br>
<br>
(And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my special treasure; and I will spare them)<br>
17 And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.<br>
<br>
18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.<br>
1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.<br>
2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.<br>
3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts.<br>
4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgements.<br>
<br>
In the Hebrew text, all of Malachi 4 was originally numbered as part of Malachi 3, verses 19-24.<br>
So, if you encounter a Hebrew text that shows only three chapters of the book of Malachi,<br>
verses 19-24 in chapter 3 were later made into what we now call Malachi chapter 4.<br>
Also, in the original, ancient Hebrew, mount Horeb was another name for mount Sinai.<br>
<br>
Malachi 3:13 through Malachi 4:4 NLT<br>
13 "You have said terrible things about me," says the Lord.<br>
"But you say, 'What do you mean? What have we said against you?'<br>
14 "You have said, 'What's the use of serving God? What have we gained by obeying his commands or by trying to show the Lord of Heaven's Armies that we are sorry for our sins?<br>
15 From now on we will call the arrogant blessed. For those who do evil get rich, and those who dare God to punish them suffer no harm.'"<br>
16 Then those who feared the Lord spoke with each other, and the Lord listened to what they said. In his presence, a scroll of remembrance was written to record the names of those who feared him and always thought about the honour of his name.<br>
17 "They will be my people," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies. "On the day when I act in judgement, they will be my own special treasure. I will spare them as a father spares an obedient child.<br>
18 Then you will again see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not."<br>
1 The Lord of Heaven's Armies says, "The day of judgement is coming, burning like a furnace. On that day the arrogant and the wicked will be burned up like straw. They will be consumed -- roots, branches, and all.<br>
2 "But for you who fear my name, the Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in his wings. And you will go free, leaping with joy like calves let out to pasture.<br>
3 On the day when I act, you will tread upon the wicked as if they were dust under your feet," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
4 "Remember to obey the Law of Moses, my servant -- all the decrees and regulations that I gave him on (Mount Horeb, also known as) Mount Sinai for all Israel.<br>
<br>

Revelation 2: 2-5 KJV<br>
2 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:<br>
3 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.<br>
4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.<br>
5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works....<br>
<br>
Revelation 2: 2-5 NLT<br>
2 "I know all the things you do. I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance. I know you don't tolerate evil people. You have examined the claims of those who say they are apostles but are not. You have discovered they are liars.<br>
3 You have patiently suffered for me without quitting.<br>
<br>
("But I have this complaint against you. You have lost your first love.)<br>
4 "But I have this complaint against you. You don't love me or each other as you did at first!<br>
5 Look how far you have fallen! Turn back to me and do the works you did at first.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 3 talks about a lukewarm church.<br>
Commentary:<br>
Is it possible to be a lukewarm person?  The Bible is talking about a lukewarm church, not a lukewarm person.<br>
But if there is such a thing as a lukewarm person, what would they be like?<br>
Are you a lukewarm person?  How can I tell if I might be lukewarm?<br>
Well, a lukewarm person, like those in a lukewarm church, would think and say stuff like this...<br>
'I am rich. I have everything I want. I don't need a thing!'<br>
Is that what you say about yourself and your finances?<br>
If you cannot say that about your financial situation, then you are not lukewarm, and that's a good thing!<br>
I usually think, say and pray stuff like, 'Save me Lord, I need your help! I am poor and needy, and I don't know how to make it through this day without you.'<br>
That's a better situation to be in, than being a lukewarm person in a lukewarm church.<br>
<br>
Here is a beautiful Warning in Time of Indifference, and the NLT here even uses the word, Indifference!<br>
Revelation 3: 14-19 NLT<br>
This is the message from the one who is the Amen -- the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's new creation:<br>
(the ruler of God's new creation)<br>
(the source of God's new creation)<br>
<br>
15 "I know all the things you do, that you are neither hot nor cold. I wish that you were one or the other!<br>
16 But since you are like lukewarm water, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth!<br>
17 You say, 'I am rich. I have everything I want. I don't need a thing!' And you don't realise that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.<br>
18 So I advise you to buy gold from me -- gold that has been purified by fire. Then you will be rich. Also buy white garments from me so you will not be shamed by your nakedness, and ointment for your eyes so you will be able to see.<br>
19 I correct and discipline everyone I love. So be diligent and turn from your indifference.<br>

17 asking God, the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to give you spiritual wisdom and insight so that you might grow in your knowledge of God.<br>

Matthew 24:34-42 KJV<br>
34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.<br>
35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.<br>
36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.<br>
37 But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.<br>
38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,<br>
39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.<br>
40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.<br>
41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.<br>
42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.<br>

Matthew 24:34-42 NLT<br>
34 I tell you the truth, (this age, this nation,) this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things take place.<br>
35 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.<br>
36 "However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows.<br>
37 "When the Son of Man returns, it will be like it was in Noah's day.<br>
38 In those days before the flood, the people were enjoying banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat.<br>
39 People didn't realise what was going to happen until the flood came and swept them all away. That is the way it will be when the Son of Man comes.<br>
40 "Two men will be working together in the field; one will be taken, the other left.<br>
41 Two women will be grinding flour at the mill; one will be taken, the other left.<br>
42 "So you, too, must keep watch! For you don't know what day your Lord is coming.<br>

No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<br>
<br>
Matthew 6: 24 & 25 (NLT)<br>
"No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be enslaved to money.<br>
25 "That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life -- whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn't life more than food, and your body more than clothing?<br>

Forgiveness in Time of Conviction<br>
1 John 1:9 KJV<br>
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:32 KJV<br>
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take this Help in Time of Need page, and turn this list into a prayer.<br>
<br>
<br>
In English, we pray and call upon the name of our Father in Heaven, our dear Heavenly Father, Almighty, Holy God, The Lord Jesus Christ.  In the original, ancient Hebrew, we call upon your name as well as we can, calling upon your name, the name of Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, we thank you for being our very present Help in Time of Need. You know all about all of the things that we are in need of every day, and we thankfully receive your forgiveness, your mercy and grace and your provision.  Save us now and help us now with all that we need.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, continue to help us walk in The Way of Salvation.  Help us to walk in the way that you want us to go every day.<br>
Show us how to get on and stay on the right path, the best path to walk on every day, according to your perfect will.<br>
It's not the path that I say that is right; it is the path that you say that is right.<br>
I do not want to ever accidentally step off of the path the you want us to remain upon.  Thank you for your path of Salvation, forgiveness, righteousness, wisdom and truth.  Thank you for continuing to show us the way that we should go, in our hearts, minds, and souls.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, Comfort me in Time of Loneliness. I stand alone on the Word of God. Though none go with me, still I will follow. I know that I am never alone, and that you are with me, you go before me, and you surround me and protect me at all times, and you never sleep.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, Comfort us in Time of Sorrow. When we are faced with sadness, with loss, with mourning, sorrow and weeping, that you will comfort us with your comforter, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit that is Holy, the Hawk-Oh-Desh Roo-awk,  Roo-awk Hawk-Oh-Desh, the set-apart breath of Yaw.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give us Relief in Time of Suffering. Cast out pain, give us strength, and deliver us from sufferings and persecutions, and lead us to a secret, private hiding place of safety, security and protection, and peace.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give us wisdom and Guidance in Time of Decision. Be our good shepherd and guide us to safety and provision so that we can rest in safety and peace. Help us be bold, brave and courageous in battle, in spiritual warfare, in prayer, and in the actions that we need to take for your kingdom, for your purposes and for your glory. May our decisions and actions always be in alignment and agreement with your perfect will.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give us Protection in Time of Danger. Be our strength, our shield, our covering, our strong fortress, our strong, high tower. Put us in the right place at the right time around the right people, and help us stay far away from the wrong place at the wrong time and the wrong people.  Do not let us be the victim of someone else's sins, delusions and deceptions.  Do not let us be deceived, but guide us into all truth, all good wisdom from above, and your knowledge and understanding, revelation and discernment. Cast out of us all lies and all sin. Cast out from us and around us and our home all evil, unclean spirits. Cast out of us all evil spiritual strongholds.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give us Courage in Time of Fear. Let us not be given in to a spirit of fear, but instead, power, love and a sound mind.  Give us your perfect love, because perfect love casts out all fear. Be our light and our salvation, be the strength of our life, help us make decisions and operate and execute your plan and your will. Give us your good wisdom from above.  Help us walk the path carefully.  Don't let us run towards something or someone that we should be staying far away from, and don't let us run away from something or someone that we should be running towards.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give your Peace in Time of Turmoil. We want your peace that you give to us.  We don't want the world's peace that is false.  We want you to give us your peace that is true. Help us keep our minds stayed on you, help us keep our minds, hearts and souls fixed on you and stayed on you, help us keep our ears and eyes fixed on you and stayed on you, and give us your perfect peace, and your good, pleasing and perfect will. Help us always be watching and listening for your directions and your instructions, and help us smartly carry them out.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, help us Rest in Time of Weariness. Help us guard and keep your seven feasts and your Sabbath days of rest. Help us not give up, help us not faint, help us run the race with patience and not be weary, help us walk through the valley of the shadow of death, and not faint. Restore my soul. Restore our souls. Restore unto me the joy of your salvation. When the time is right and the place is safe, make the place be safe, and give us good rest in a place of safety and provision.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give us Strength in Time of Temptation.  Help us always quickly escape from temptation. Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  Don't let us give way to temptation.  Do not let us give any provision for the flesh.  Do not let us be deceived. Help us fear you, obey you, and follow you alone.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, may we quickly receive, perceive and correctly respond to your Warning in Time of Indifference.  Do not let me feel or become lukewarm.  Do not let the church or Bible study group or fellowship that we are a part of become lukewarm. Whatever church, or fellowship or Bible study group or family that we are a part of, don't let us become Loveless. Don't let our love for you and our love for one another grow cold.  Don't let us be Persecuted. Save us and deliver us from sufferings, persecutions, troubles, trials and tribulations. Save us from our own inadequacies, weaknesses, limitations and imperfections.  Don't let us be Compromising.  May we always be passionate about faithfully following and obeying you.  Don't let us be Corrupt.  Don't let us become corrupt.  Don't let us become a Dead Church.  Don't let us have faith without works. Breathe life into us.  Help us study your word and your scriptures and your Torah.  Help us do the Bible and do what it says.<br>
<br>
May we always be on fire and passionate towards you and doing what the scriptures say to do.  Don't let us be Lukewarm and do not let us have indifference, but don't let us make emotional decisions and make decisions based on anger and emotions. But don't let us be indifferent when we need to take action, but let us make and take the wise and correct actions, and make the wise and correct decisions. Since there can be strong delusions and deceptions around us, what we should actually do, and what appears to be physically, visually right, may not actually be the right thing to actually do. Just because it appears to be right, visually, does not mean it is right, spiritually. Satan can appear as an angel of light. So, give us your good instruction, direction and wisdom which is always good and always better than what the world might be telling us or showing us. Thank you for being Faithful to us.  Your love for us and your faithfulness reaches to the skies.  Help us be faithful.  Help us be the faithful church, the faithful family, the faithful fellowship. Help us fellowship faithfully.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, give us Forgiveness in Time of Conviction. Help us love each other and forgive each other.  We thankfully receive the work that you did on the cross.  We believe and receive your forgiveness, your righteousness, and your salvation and deliverance. Help us now and save us now.  We believe that Yaw-Who-Wah is Yaw-Who-Shaw, and that Yaw-Who-Shaw is Yaw-Who-Wah. In English, we would say that we believe that Jesus Christ is the Lord God, and that the Lord God is Jesus Christ, one and the same. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is our messiah, and our saviour. Give us your mercy and grace, and give us your love, your joy, your peace and your healing and your strength.<br>
<br>
We pray for all of these things in the name of Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, Aw-Main, Amen, so be it, let it become true.  Hallelujah!<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Scared,<br>
oh I thought I knew scared<br>
But I'm so filled with fear<br>
I can barely<br>
move<br>
<br>
<br>
Doubt,<br>
I've had my share of doubt<br>
But never more than right now<br>
I'm wondering where are You<br>
<br>
<br>
Here on the edge of fall apart<br>
Somehow Your promises<br>
Find my troubled heart<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the truth I'm standing on<br>
Even when all my strength is gone<br>
You are faithful forever<br>
And I know You'll never<br>
Let me fall<br>
<br>
<br>
Right now I'm choosing to believe<br>
Someday soon I'll look back and see<br>
All the pain had a purpose<br>
Your plan was perfect all along<br>
This is the truth I'm standing on<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Good,<br>
I believe You're still good<br>
Even when life's not good<br>
I will not lose this hope<br>
<br>
<br>
That the God who parts the sea<br>
Promises He's gonna<br>
Make a way for me<br>
<br>
Oh, This is the truth I'm standing on<br>
Even when all my strength is gone<br>
You are faithful forever<br>
And I know You'll never<br>
Let me fall<br>
<br>
Right now I'm choosing to believe<br>
Someday soon I'll look back and see<br>
All the pain had a purpose<br>
Your plan was perfect all along<br>
This is the truth I'm standing on<br>
<br>
<br>
My rock my shield my firm foundation<br>
I know I will not be shaken<br>
You remind me<br>
Where my help comes from<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the truth I'm standing on<br>
Even when all my strength is gone<br>
You are faithful forever<br>
And I know You'll never<br>
Let me fall<br>
<br>
Right now I'm choosing to believe<br>
Someday soon I'll look back and see<br>
All the pain had a purpose<br>
Because your plan was perfect<br>
all along<br>
This is the truth I'm standing on<br>

<br>
<br>
Redeeming The Time<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 22:3 (KJV)<br>
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 22:3 NLT<br>
A prudent person foresees danger and takes precautions.<br>
The simpleton goes blindly on and suffers the consequences.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 27:12 (KJV)<br>
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 27:12 NLT<br>
A prudent person foresees danger and takes precautions.<br>
The simpleton goes blindly on and suffers the consequences.<br>
<br>
Both of the above verses use the same Hebrew word that means, prudent.<br>
It is the Hebrew word, that is pronounced, Ah-Room.<br>
Another way of saying it is like this, Ay-Room.<br>
It is this word, Ah-Room, or, Ay-Room, that is being translated into the English word, prudent.<br>
<br>
This Hebrew word for, prudent, means that, a prudent person is<br>
subtle, shrewd, crafty, sly, and sensible.<br>
<br>
Here is what, prudent, means today, according to a few Dictionaries...<br>
<br>
Longman Dictionary:<br>
prudent is being sensible and careful, especially by trying to avoid unnecessary risks<br>
<br>
Chambers Dictionary:<br>
prudent is being wise or careful in conduct, shrewd or thrifty in planning ahead, being wary; discreet.<br>
<br>
Cambridge Dictionary:<br>
prudent is being careful and avoiding risks<br>
<br>
Collins Dictionary:<br>
Someone who is prudent is sensible and careful.<br>
<br>
Oxford Dictionary:<br>
prudent is being sensible and careful when you make judgements and decisions; avoiding unnecessary risks<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 2:4 (KJV)<br>
Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 2:4 is what we see being quoted a few times in the New Testament...<br>
<br>
Romans 1:17 (KJV)<br>
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:38 (KJV)<br>
Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.<br>
<br>
Galatians 2:20 (KJV)<br>
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 3:11 (KJV)<br>
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 3:13 KJV<br>
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 3: 9-14 KJV<br>
9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.<br>
<br>
10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.<br>
<br>
11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.<br>
<br>
12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.<br>
<br>
13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:<br>
<br>
14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 3: 9-14 NLT<br>
9 So all who put their faith in Christ share the same blessing Abraham received because of his faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
10 But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, "Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God's Book of the Law."<br>
(from Deuteronomy 27:26)<br>
<br>
11 So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law. For the Scriptures say, "It is through faith that a righteous person has life."<br>
(referencing Habakkuk 2:4)<br>
<br>
12 This way of faith is very different from the way of law, which says, "It is through obeying the law that a person has life."<br>
(from Leviticus 18:5)<br>
<br>
13 But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law. When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing. For it is written in the Scriptures, "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree."<br>
(quoting from the Greek version of Deuteronomy 21:23)<br>
<br>
14 Through Christ Jesus, God has blessed the Gentiles with the same blessing he promised to Abraham, (so that we who are believers might receive the blessing of the Holy Spirit through faith,) so that we who are believers might receive the promised Holy Spirit through faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 19:14 KJV<br>
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.<br>
<br>
Psalms 19: 12-14 NLT<br>
12<br>
How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart?<br>
Cleanse me from these hidden faults.<br>
13<br>
Keep your servant from deliberate sins!<br>
Don't let them control me.<br>
Then I will be free of guilt<br>
and innocent of great sin.<br>
14<br>
May the words of my mouth<br>
and the meditation of my heart<br>
be pleasing to you,<br>
O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 44:22 KJV<br>
I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 44: 21 & 22 NLT<br>
...I, the Lord, made you,<br>
and I will not forget you.<br>
22<br>
I have swept away your sins like a cloud.<br>
I have scattered your offences like the morning mist.<br>
Oh, return to me,<br>
for I have paid the price to set you free."<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: There is a way how souls can be lost, and there is a way how souls can be won.<br>
Make the most of what time you have left, winning souls over to Christ and his salvation -- God's gift of eternal life.<br>
Wake up the people that are asleep with the truth.<br>
Wake up the dead people that are asleep with the way, the truth, the life, the Torah, the Light, the Gospel.<br>
<br>
Mark 8:36 KJV<br>
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 16:26 KJV<br>
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 11:30 KJV<br>
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5:16 (KJV)<br>
Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<br>
<br>
Colossians 4:5 (KJV)<br>
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.<br>
<br>
Colossians 4:5 (NLT)<br>
Live wisely among those who are not believers, and make the most of every opportunity.<br>
<br>
We'll go back to Colossians 4 in just a moment.<br>
First, let's look again at what is going on there in Ephesians 5.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5: 14-21 KJV<br>
14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.<br>
15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,<br>
16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<br>
17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.<br>
18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;<br>
19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;<br>
20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.<br>

Ephesians 5: 14-21 NLT<br>
14 for the light makes everything visible. This is why it is said,<br>
"Awake, O sleeper,<br>
rise up from the dead,<br>
and Christ will give you light."<br>
15 So be careful how you live. Don't live like fools, but like those who are wise.<br>
16 Make the most of every opportunity in these evil days.<br>
17 Don't act thoughtlessly, but understand what the Lord wants you to do.<br>
18 Don't be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit,<br>
19 singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, and making music to the Lord in your hearts.<br>
20 And give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
21 And further, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3:15 (NLT)<br>
Instead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, always be ready to explain it.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 3:15 KJV<br>
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:<br>
<br>
<br>
Colossians 4: 5 & 6 (KJV)<br>
5 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.<br>
6 Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.<br>
<br>
Colossians 4: 5 & 6 (NLT)<br>
5 Live wisely among those who are not believers, and make the most of every opportunity.<br>
6 Let your conversation be gracious and attractive so that you will have the right response for everyone.<br>
(Let your conversation be gracious and attractive and seasoned with salt so that you will have the right response for everyone.)<br>
<br>
Commentary: As you serve them the meat of God's word, make the meat taste good as it enters into them, seasoned with salt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 9: 49 & 50 KJV<br>
49 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.<br>
50 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.<br>
<br>
Mark 9: 49 & 50 NLT<br>
49 "For everyone will be tested with fire.<br>
(For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.)<br>
50 Salt is good for seasoning. But if it loses its flavour, how do you make it salty again? You must have the qualities of salt among yourselves and live in peace with each other."<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 5:16 and Colossians 4:5 both tell us to be Redeeming the time.<br>
Both of those verses are both using there the same Greek word, which is pronounced, Severazzo.<br>
<br>
Let's look at a few books to see what that word means.<br>
We will look it up in a few books, including the<br>
Strong's Greek Lexicon, from the Strong's Greek Dictionary provided by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen,<br>
A Greek-English Lexicon, by Henry George Liddell, and Robert Scott<br>
and Thayer's Lexicon prepared by Alan Bunning from the Centre for New Testament Restoration, and<br>
Tyndale Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Greek, and<br>
Greek-English lexicon by John Jeffrey Dodson (the 2010 public domain version)<br>
<br>
We will look mainly at all of those books and compile a definition.<br>
Again, Ephesians 5:16 and Colossians 4:5 are both using there,<br>
where it says, Redeeming, as in, Redeeming the time,<br>
the same Greek word there, for, Redeeming, is pronounced, Severazzo.<br>
<br>
The Greek word, Severazzo, means,<br>
to buy up, ransom, redeem<br>
I ransom, redeem<br>
I buy out, to buy up, buy away from, ransom; I purchase out, buy, redeem, choose.<br>
to rescue from loss, improve opportunity,<br>
by payment of a price to recover from the power of another, to ransom, buy off<br>
it reminds me of Christ freeing the believers from the dominion of sin and the Law at the price of his death on the cross and his resurrection from the grave.<br>
to buy up, to buy up for one's self, for one's use<br>
to make wise and sacred use of every opportunity for doing good, so that zeal and well doing are as it were the purchase money by which we make the time our own<br>
<br>
Here is a repeat of something that was shared way back in Christian Essays 1...<br>
Commentary: All the work that needed to be done so that we can go to Heaven, instead of hell, Jesus did that work on the Cross for us. That is why...<br>
<br>
...He said, It is finished: and he bowed his head... John 19:30 (KJV)<br>
<br>
The Greek word that was translated into, finished, is pronounced, Teh-LAY-Oh.<br>
It means...<br>
to complete, fulfil, accomplish, a fulfilment<br>
I end, accomplish, pay<br>
I end, finish,<br>
I fulfil, accomplish,<br>
I pay.<br>
to end, complete, execute, conclude, to discharge (a debt)<br>
<br>
Commentary: The debt was paid in full.<br>
Since the wages of sin is death, Jesus paid that wage for you, and he paid it in full, because He loves you, to death.<br>
<br>
Once again, The Greek word, Severazzo, means,<br>
I purchase out, to buy up, ransom, redeem<br>
<br>
Mark 10:45 (NLT)<br>
For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many."<br>
<br>

For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.<br>
<br>

Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2:6 (KJV)<br>
Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2:6 (NLT)<br>
He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 13:14 (KJV)<br>
I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 35:10 (KJV)<br>
And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.<br>
<br>
Isaiah 35:10 (NLT)<br>
Those who have been ransomed by the Lord will return. They will enter Jerusalem singing, crowned with everlasting joy. Sorrow and mourning will disappear, and they will be filled with joy and gladness.<br>

<br>
As we get ready to bring this Bible study to a close, let's do a final summary along with some comments, and then we will finish this up by placing this study into a prayer and applying it to our lives.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  There are many things to think about in this Bible study. Here are only a few thoughts and comments.  We are being called to redeem the time.  A voucher, a coupon and paper currency are all just pieces of paper, until the paper is redeemed and is used to purchase something of value.  Your time is valuable. What is the most valuable way to spend your time?  Spend the time to tell others about Jesus Christ, and his actual name, Yaw-Who-Shaw.  Make the most of your time, and do the best that you can with what little time you have left here, to help others get saved, help others learn more about our Heavenly Father and our Messiah and Saviour, and help the people around you get closer to the Lord, and learn more about Him, walking in His ways and His truth.  Don't just talk about it.  Don't just read it to them. Show them what it looks like.  Show them what love looks like. Even if the Lord does not show you specific people that you can reach out to at this time, you can at least pray for others.  Pray for the neighbours, the people who live next door or down the street.  Pray for people that you sit next to or spend time with at work or school.  Pray for every single person that is listed in your phone, or is following you on your social media account.  Pray for friends and enemies, relatives and strangers. Also, pray for their marriages, their families, their children, and whoever else the Lord reveals to you.<br>
<br>
You might call yourself a Christian, you might say that you have done Romans 10:9, you might say that you are saved and that you are a believer, but are you awake?  Are you alive? Light will make your darkness go away.  If you were a fruit tree, would you look alive and flourishing with the fruit of the Spirit, or would you look dry, brown and dead, shrivelled up, faded and withered away?  Can an unhealthy tree produce healthy fruit? What would a farmer do if he had a fruit tree that never produced any fruit?  He would cut it down and turn it into firewood, and have something else take its place in the field. The Bible is filled with perfect truth, but if you don't study your entire Bible every day, how would you know what the truth is?<br>
<br>
It is possible to be saved and cursed.  If you are saved, you believe that Jesus is Lord, you have done Romans 10:9 and you are going to Heaven.  But if you are cursed, your life will be difficult, hard, short, unhealthy, painful, sad and lonely.  If you are blessed, you will have lots of the fruit of the spirit to eat and to produce and distribute, and that includes love, joy, and peace.  Being blessed means that your life will be more healthy, longer, careful and safe, generally speaking, but not always guaranteed.  The Bible also promises suffering, persecution, troubles, trials and tribulations, big and small, including the Great Tribulation.  When you are blessed, you may have good-quality friends and will be a good-quality friend to others.  Being blessed, and what that looks like for you, personally, and what that would be for others, being blessed, will be different things to different people, but it will always be better, happier and healthier for you, eventually, than being cursed. How do you be saved and blessed?  Being saved gets you into heaven, but being blessed instead of cursed can only be done by studying and obeying the entire Bible.  You can't do that, obey that and understand all that unless Jesus Christ, Yaw-Who-Shaw is living in you first, having full access and full control of all of your heart, mind, soul and strength.<br>
<br>
The Bible teaches the truth. Many Christians think that Sunday is the day of rest, and that you should go to church on Sunday.  What does the Bible say?  It says, it is Saturday.  Who said that it's Sunday?  The Catholics boast on their website that they changed it to Sunday, referencing Bible verses that have nothing to do with the Sabbath, and then referencing many books that are not in the Bible.  Not in the Bible means that it is not Christian.<br>
<br>
If you want to be cursed, just do the opposite of what the Bible says, and disobey it on purpose. Better yet, avoid reading the Bible and just say that you are too busy doing things for yourself and making money, and all of the curses listed in the Bible will all come true for you, even if you have never read the list of all of those curses.  Studying and obeying the Bible will help you keep away from sin, and you will be blessed, or, sin will keep you away from studying and obeying your Bible, and you will be cursed.  The choice is yours.  No matter how far away you have walked, the One who can give you the power to turn all of your curses into blessings is still only one prayer away, and is mighty to save, and with as little as just one miracle, he can transform and remodel and heal you so that, instead of being saved and cursed, you can be saved and blessed.  Read your Bible and pray, every single day, and ask Him to enter into you, into your heart, mind, soul, and life, and ask him to create what is missing, repair what is broken or damaged, and completely remove that which does not belong in you, and he will give you the ability to love God, and to love others, and happily study and obey the entire Bible.  Without the Lord Jesus, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, you can do nothing, but you can do all things through Him, because He is the one giving you strength, knowledge, wisdom and understanding.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, the Bible teaches the truth.  Here is another example. Many Christians freely eat, pig, sausage, ham, pork and bacon.  The Bible says that this pig animal is not food and is unsafe and unclean.  It's like eating cardboard, plastic, or strips of Perspex, or pieces of old tyres, or shards of broken glass.  It is not food.  Yet, in a Bible study that we did here not too long ago, many newer English translations have manufactured and inserted a verse in the New Testament that never actually was there.  It's a lie of absolute fiction from the prince of all lies, satan, who can deceive and appear as an angel of light.  The NIV translators used their imagination and added this lie into the NIV Bible in 1978, and this noxious, toxic weed has been spreading into other newer English translations ever since.<br>
<br>
There are many, many more examples of Christians living a dead life, then being awakened, studying the Bible from cover to cover, then doing what is says and trying their best to actually obey it.  The greatest authority on the Bible is only the Bible, and not a Catholic webpage.  Because it has always been perfectly and absolutely true, the Bible says it and that is the end of any argument right there. It's hard to argue with printed text made with permanent ink.  As you keep talking to it, the text just stays exactly the same, yesterday, today and forever.<br>
<br>
I could think of many, many more examples and important comments to share with you, but I would rather have you spend your time actually reading the Bible, than reading some comments from some sinner, so, let's bring this study to a close with a prayer.  Let's pray.<br>
<br>
Dear Lord Jesus, Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw<br>
I pray for these things for myself, my marriage, my family and friends, our neighbours, and the families, children and people of our Bible study and fellowship.<br>
Save us now.  Help us be prudent and careful in our actions and decisions, being guided, piloted and directed only by you, our Good Shepherd.<br>
Help us live by faith, walking by faith and not by sight.<br>
Give us skills, capabilities and opportunities to win souls over to you, helping others get saved, get closer to you and become more like you.<br>
Help us Walk in wisdom toward them that are without.<br>
Help us always be redeeming the time, making the most of the time we have left to do things for the kingdom of God that will please you the most, giving you, Yaw, the most pleasure.<br>
Help us always be filled with the Holy Spirit, and help us so that we are never trying to stop, block, hinder or restrict the Holy Spirit in any way.<br>
Help us be careful how we live.<br>
Help us always be ready to explain the Gospel and the hope that is in us.<br>
Help us make every conversation be gracious and attractive so that we will have the right response for everyone, knowing how we ought to answer every man.<br>
Help us be prepared and ready always to give an answer to every man that ask about you, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, and your very present hope.<br>
Help us serve others and minister to others with the right words and the right actions.<br>
May the words of my mouth,<br>
and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, and be pleasing to you,<br>
O Lord, my rock, my strength, my saviour, my deliverer and my redeemer.<br>
We pray this in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Aw-Main, Amen.<br>

Moses and The Promised Land<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1:10 (KJV)<br>
Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 1: 8-10 (NLT)<br>
...We were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure, and we thought we would never live through it.<br>
9 In fact, we expected to die. But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God, who raises the dead.<br>
10 And he did rescue us from mortal danger, and he will rescue us again. We have placed our confidence in him, and he will continue to rescue us.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 10 is a fast review of Lessons from Israel's Idolatry, as it does a quick review of Old Testament history, reminding us to stay away from the worship of idols.<br>
There are many flashbacks of many lessons and stories from many chapters that are all happening in these few verses of 1 Corinthians 10.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 10: verses 1 through 15 -- NLT<br>
<br>
1 I don't want you to forget, dear brothers and sisters, about our ancestors in the wilderness long ago. All of them were guided by a cloud that moved ahead of them, and all of them walked through the sea on dry ground.<br>
2 In the cloud and in the sea, all of them were baptised as followers of Moses.<br>
3 All of them ate the same spiritual food,<br>
4 and all of them drank the same spiritual water. For they drank from the spiritual rock that travelled with them, and that rock was Christ.<br>
5 Yet God was not pleased with most of them, and their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.<br>
6 These things happened as a warning to us, so that we would not crave evil things as they did,<br>
7 or worship idols as some of them did. As the Scriptures say, "The people celebrated with feasting and drinking, and they indulged in pagan revelry."<br>
(That verse right there, verse 7, is referring to what happened in Exodus 32:6, when they got tired of waiting for Moses to come back down the mountain, and they made The Gold Calf.)<br>
<br>
8 And we must not engage in sexual immorality as some of them did, causing 23,000 of them to die in one day.<br>
9 Nor should we put Christ to the test, as some of them did and then died from snakebites.<br>
10 And don't grumble as some of them did, and then were destroyed by the angel of death.<br>
11 These things happened to them as examples for us. They were written down to warn us who live at the end of the age.<br>
12 If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  Think about this, what we just read, here in verse 12. Many of the great heroes of the Old Testament made bad mistakes after they had their success.<br>
Noah had already completed his mission with the ark when he got passed-out drunk and naked.  David had already became king when he committed adultery and tried to cover it up with the murder of an innocent man.<br>
It's especially after you have reached your achievement of success when you need to be very careful not to fall into sin.<br>
If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall.<br>
Let's go back now to<br>
1 Corinthians 10: and continue with verse 13 through 16 in the NLT.  We have studied this next part here before, in a previous study...<br>
<br>
13 The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure.<br>
(The KJV says, He will make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.)<br>
14 So, my dear friends, flee from the worship of idols.<br>
15 You are reasonable people. Decide for yourselves if what I am saying is true.<br>
<br>
Here's a little side note, whilst we are here in 1 Corinthians 10.<br>
If you read verse 3, verse 4, and then verse 16 and 17, you might see something interesting here in the NLT...<br>
1 Corinthians 10, verse 3, verse 4, then verse 16, and verse 17, NLT<br>
<br>
3 All of them ate the same spiritual food,<br>
4 and all of them drank the same spiritual water. For they drank from the spiritual rock that travelled with them, and that rock was Christ.<br>
16 When we bless the cup at the Lord's Table, aren't we sharing in the blood of Christ? And when we break the bread, aren't we sharing in the body of Christ?<br>
17 And though we are many, we all eat from one loaf of bread, showing that we are one body.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 12:20 (NLT)<br>
Yes, there are many parts, but only one body.<br>
<br>
Romans 12:5 (NLT)<br>
so it is with Christ's body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 4:4 (NLT)<br>
For there is one body and one Spirit, just as you have been called to one glorious hope for the future.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2:16 (NLT)<br>
Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of his death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to death.<br>
<br>
Colossians 3:15 (NLT)<br>
And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body you are called to live in peace. And always be thankful.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 105 also does a quick review of Old Testament history.<br>
Let's look at the part that focuses on the book of Exodus.<br>
<br>
Psalms 105: 23-43 KJV<br>
23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.<br>
24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.<br>
25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.<br>
26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.<br>
<br>
(They shewed words of his signs among them,)<br>
27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.<br>
28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.<br>
29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.<br>
30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.<br>
31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.<br>
<br>
(He gave their rain hail,)<br>
32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.<br>
33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.<br>
34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,<br>
35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.<br>
36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.<br>
37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.<br>
38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.<br>
39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.<br>
40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.<br>
41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.<br>
42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.<br>
<br>
43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:<br>
(and his chosen with singing:)<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 105: 23-43 NLT<br>
23<br>
Then Israel arrived in Egypt;<br>
Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.<br>
24<br>
And the Lord multiplied the people of Israel<br>
until they became too mighty for their enemies.<br>
25<br>
Then he turned the Egyptians against the Israelites,<br>
and they plotted against the Lord's servants.<br>
26<br>
But the Lord sent his servant Moses,<br>
along with Aaron, whom he had chosen.<br>
27<br>
They performed miraculous signs among the Egyptians,<br>
and wonders in the land of Ham.<br>
28<br>
The Lord blanketed Egypt in darkness,<br>
for they had defied his commands to let his people go.<br>
29<br>
He turned their water into blood,<br>
poisoning all the fish.<br>
30<br>
Then frogs overran the land<br>
and even invaded the king's bedrooms.<br>
31<br>
When the Lord spoke, flies descended on the Egyptians,<br>
and gnats swarmed across Egypt.<br>
32<br>
He sent them hail instead of rain,<br>
and lightning flashed over the land.<br>
33<br>
He ruined their grapevines and fig trees<br>
and shattered all the trees.<br>
34<br>
He spoke, and hordes of locusts came --<br>
young locusts beyond number.<br>
35<br>
They ate up everything green in the land,<br>
destroying all the crops in their fields.<br>
36<br>
Then he killed the oldest...in each Egyptian home,<br>
the pride and joy of each family.<br>
37<br>
The Lord brought his people out of Egypt, loaded with silver and gold;<br>
and not one among the tribes of Israel even stumbled.<br>
38<br>
Egypt was glad when they were gone,<br>
for they feared them greatly.<br>
39<br>
The Lord spread a cloud above them as a covering<br>
and gave them a great fire to light the darkness.<br>
40<br>
They asked for meat, and he sent them quail;<br>
he satisfied their hunger with manna -- bread from heaven.<br>
41<br>
He split open a rock, and water gushed out<br>
to form a river through the dry wasteland.<br>
42<br>
For he remembered his sacred promise<br>
to his servant Abraham.<br>
43<br>
So he brought his people out of Egypt with joy,<br>
his chosen ones with rejoicing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 78: 10-29 KJV<br>
10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;<br>
11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.<br>
12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<br>
13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.<br>
14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.<br>
15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.<br>
16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.<br>
17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.<br>
18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.<br>
<br>
(Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God order a table in the wilderness?)<br>
19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?<br>
20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?<br>
21 Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;<br>
22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:<br>
23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,<br>
24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.<br>
<br>
(Every one did eat the bread of the mighty: he sent them meat to the full.)<br>
25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.<br>
<br>
(He caused an east wind to go in the heaven:)<br>
26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.<br>
27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, (and fowl of wing,) and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:<br>
28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.<br>
29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 78: 10-29 NLT<br>
10<br>
They did not keep God's covenant<br>
and refused to live by his instructions.<br>
11<br>
They forgot what he had done --<br>
the great wonders he had shown them,<br>
12<br>
the miracles he did for their ancestors<br>
on the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt.<br>
13<br>
For he divided the sea and led them through,<br>
making the water stand up like walls!<br>
14<br>
In the daytime he led them by a cloud,<br>
and all night by a pillar of fire.<br>
15<br>
He split open the rocks in the wilderness<br>
to give them water, as from a gushing spring.<br>
16<br>
He made streams pour from the rock,<br>
making the waters flow down like a river!<br>
17<br>
Yet they kept on sinning against him,<br>
rebelling against the Most High in the desert.<br>
18<br>
They stubbornly tested God in their hearts,<br>
demanding the foods they craved.<br>
19<br>
They even spoke against God himself, saying,<br>
"God can't give us food in the wilderness.<br>
20<br>
Yes, he can strike a rock so water gushes out,<br>
but he can't give his people bread and meat."<br>
21<br>
When the Lord heard them, he was furious.<br>
The fire of his wrath burned against Jacob.<br>
Yes, his anger rose against Israel,<br>
22<br>
for they did not believe God<br>
or trust him to care for them.<br>
23<br>
But he commanded the skies to open;<br>
he opened the doors of heaven.<br>
24<br>
He rained down manna for them to eat;<br>
he gave them bread from heaven.<br>
25<br>
They ate the food of angels!<br>
God gave them all they could hold.<br>
26<br>
He released the east wind in the heavens<br>
and guided the south wind by his mighty power.<br>
27<br>
He rained down meat as thick as dust --<br>
birds as plentiful as the sand on the seashore!<br>
28<br>
He caused the birds to fall within their camp<br>
and all around their tents.<br>
29<br>
The people ate their fill.<br>
He gave them what they craved.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In these two Psalms that we just looked at, they both talked about the rock, that the waters gushed out the rock.<br>
Here are the verses again from these two Psalms that we just looked at...<br>
<br>
Psalms 105:41 (KJV)<br>
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.<br>
<br>
Psalms 78:20 (KJV)<br>
Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 17: 1-6 KJV<br>
1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.<br>
2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?<br>
3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?<br>
4 And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.<br>
5 And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.<br>
6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
The geographical name, Sin, is related to Sinai and should not be confused with the English word sin.<br>
Mount Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 17: 1-6 NLT<br>
1 At the Lord's command, the whole community of Israel left the wilderness of Sin and moved from place to place. Eventually they camped at Rephidim, but there was no water there for the people to drink.<br>
2 So once more the people complained against Moses. "Give us water to drink!" they demanded.<br>
"Quiet!" Moses replied. "Why are you complaining against me? And why are you testing the Lord?"<br>
3 But tormented by thirst, they continued to argue with Moses. "Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Are you trying to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"<br>
4 Then Moses cried out to the Lord, "What should I do with these people? They are ready to stone me!"<br>
5 The Lord said to Moses, "Walk out in front of the people. Take your staff, the one you used when you struck the water of the Nile, and call some of the elders of Israel to join you.<br>
6 I will stand before you on the rock at Mount Sinai. Strike the rock, and water will come gushing out. Then the people will be able to drink." So Moses struck the rock as he was told, and water gushed out as the elders looked on.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 10:4 (KJV)<br>
And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10: 9 & 10 NLT<br>
9 Then he said, "Look, I have come to do your will." He cancels the first covenant in order to put the second into effect.<br>
10 For God's will was for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:10 (KJV)<br>
By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The rock was smote once for all.  It's a picture.  It's a concept.<br>
He only had to go through that and do that once for all.<br>
Unfortunately, as we are about to see here, next, when Moses is told to do this again, later on, he is only supposed to speak to the rock. Moses messed-up.  Moses lost his temper and got angry, but God was not angry. The concept, the picture that Moses was supposed to demonstrate, was that,<br>
now that Jesus died, was smote, died on the cross for our sins, buried and resurrected from the grave,<br>
he does not have to be struck again.  The work, it is finished.<br>
Now all we have to do is speak to the rock, speak out Romans 10:9 and be saved.<br>
Speak to him, confess with your mouth, pray to him to save you, and he can and he does.<br>
Don't hit him again, he was already bruised for our transgressions, and by his stripes we are healed.<br>
He was smitten and struck once for all so that all we need to do now is just speak to him. Pray to him.<br>
The Lord was not angry with the people at this time.<br>
As we are about to read here, next, Moses misrepresents the heart of the Lord.<br>
And what does Moses mean when he said out of anger, must we fetch you water out of this rock?<br>
What do you mean, we?  Like, Moses had something to do with helping to make the water come out of the rock!<br>
Pray.  Speak to the rock who can provide for you.<br>
The rock provided water anyway, even though Moses was not following the Lord's instructions.<br>
The rock provides for you anyway, even though you are not following the Lord's instructions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 20: 2-12 (KJV)<br>
2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.<br>
3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord!<br>
4 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?<br>
5 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.<br>
6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.<br>
7 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
8 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.<br>
9 And Moses took the rod from before the Lord, as he commanded him.<br>
10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?<br>
11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.<br>
12 And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Numbers 20: 2-13 (NLT)<br>
2 There was no water for the people to drink at that place, so they rebelled against Moses and Aaron.<br>
3 The people blamed Moses and said, "If only we had died in the Lord's presence with our brothers!<br>
4 Why have you brought the congregation of the Lord's people into this wilderness to die, along with all our livestock?<br>
5 Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us here to this terrible place? This land has no grain, no figs, no grapes, no pomegranates, and no water to drink!"<br>
6 Moses and Aaron turned away from the people and went to the entrance of the Tabernacle, where they fell face down on the ground. Then the glorious presence of the Lord appeared to them,<br>
7 and the Lord said to Moses,<br>
8 "You and Aaron must take the staff and assemble the entire community. As the people watch, speak to the rock over there, and it will pour out its water. You will provide enough water from the rock to satisfy the whole community and their livestock."<br>
9 So Moses did as he was told. He took the staff from the place where it was kept before the Lord.<br>
10 Then he and Aaron summoned the people to come and gather at the rock. "Listen, you rebels!" he shouted. "Must we bring you water from this rock?"<br>
11 Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with the staff, and water gushed out. So the entire community and their livestock drank their fill.<br>
12 But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust me enough to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel, you will not lead them into the land I am giving them!"<br>
13 This place was known as the waters of Meribah (which means "strife" or "arguing") because there the people of Israel (strove and) argued with the Lord, (and he was sanctified in them,) and there he demonstrated his holiness among them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 32: 48-52 KJV<br>
48 And the Lord spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,<br>
49 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:<br>
50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:<br>
<br>
(Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of strife at Kadesh,)<br>
51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.<br>
52 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 32: 48-52 NLT<br>
48 That same day the Lord said to Moses,<br>
49 "Go to Moab, to the mountains east of the river, (the mountains of Abarim,) and climb Mount Nebo, which is across from Jericho. Look out across the land of Canaan, the land I am giving to the people of Israel as their own special possession.<br>
50 Then you will die there on the mountain. You will join your ancestors, just as Aaron, your brother, died on Mount Hor and joined his ancestors.<br>
51 For both of you betrayed me with the Israelites at the waters of Meribah at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. You failed to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel there.<br>
52 So you will see the land from a distance, but you may not enter the (promised) land I am giving to the people of Israel."<br>

John 1: 16 & 17 (NLT)<br>
<br>
(From his abundance we have all received the grace of Christ rather than the grace of the law.)<br>
(From his abundance we have all received grace upon grace.)<br>
16 From his abundance we have all received one gracious blessing after another.<br>
17 For the law was given through Moses, but God's unfailing love and faithfulness came through Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 1:17 (KJV)<br>
For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Son of Man is a title Jesus used for himself.<br>
<br>
Mark 9: 2-10 (KJV)<br>
2 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.<br>
3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.<br>
4 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.<br>
5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.<br>
6 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.<br>
7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.<br>
8 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.<br>
9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.<br>
10 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 9: 2-10 (NLT)<br>
2 Six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone. As the men watched, Jesus' appearance was transformed,<br>
3 and his clothes became dazzling white, far whiter than any earthly bleach could ever make them.<br>
4 Then Elijah and Moses appeared and began talking with Jesus.<br>
5 Peter exclaimed, "Rabbi, it's wonderful for us to be here! Let's make (three tabernacles,) three shelters as memorials -- one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."<br>
6 He said this because he didn't really know what else to say, for they were all terrified.<br>
7 Then a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my dearly loved Son. Listen to him."<br>
8 Suddenly, when they looked around, Moses and Elijah were gone, and they saw only Jesus with them.<br>
9 As they went back down the mountain, he told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.<br>
10 So they kept it to themselves, but they often asked each other what he meant by "rising from the dead."<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 17: 1-9 (KJV)<br>
1 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,<br>
2 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.<br>
3 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.<br>
4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.<br>
5 Whilst he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.<br>
6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.<br>
7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.<br>
8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.<br>
9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 17: 1-9 (NLT)<br>
1 Six days later Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, James and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone.<br>
2 As the men watched, Jesus' appearance was transformed so that his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.<br>
3 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and began talking with Jesus.<br>
4 Peter exclaimed, "Lord, it's wonderful for us to be here!<br>
(If you want, I'll make three tabernacles as memorials --)<br>
If you want, I'll make three shelters as memorials -- one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."<br>
5 But even as he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy. Listen to him."<br>
6 The disciples were terrified and fell face down on the ground.<br>
7 Then Jesus came over and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."<br>
8 And when they looked up, Moses and Elijah were gone, and they saw only Jesus.<br>
9 As they went back down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 9 28-36 KJV<br>
28 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.<br>
29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.<br>
30 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:<br>
31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.<br>
32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.<br>
33 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.<br>
34 Whilst he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.<br>
35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.<br>
36 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 9 28-36 NLT<br>
28 About eight days later Jesus took Peter, John, and James up on a mountain to pray.<br>
29 And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was transformed, and his clothes became dazzling white.<br>
30 Suddenly, two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared and began talking with Jesus.<br>
31 They were glorious to see. And they were speaking about his exodus from this world, which was about to be fulfilled in Jerusalem.<br>
32 Peter and the others had fallen asleep. When they woke up, they saw Jesus' glory and the two men standing with him.<br>
33 As Moses and Elijah were starting to leave, Peter, not even knowing what he was saying, blurted out,<br>
"Master, it's wonderful for us to be here!<br>
(Let's make three tabernacles as memorials --)<br>
Let's make three shelters as memorials -- one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."<br>
34 But even as he was saying this, a cloud overshadowed them, and terror gripped them as the cloud covered them.<br>
35 Then a voice from the cloud said, (This is my dearly loved Son.) "This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen to him."<br>
36 When the voice finished, Jesus was there alone. They didn't tell anyone at that time what they had seen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Peter wanted to remember where they were standing by making some kind of memorial.<br>
But, it's not where they were standing that is important, it is what Jesus is saying and teaching.<br>
That's why the name of the exact mountain and its precise location are deliberately not recorded in the Bible.<br>
It's not about the mountain itself or the exact spot where they were standing.  It is the words of the word of God that became flesh and dwelt among us.<br>
It's the words, commandments and teachings of Jesus Christ that are important.<br>
Going to church is nice, but it's not the church location that is important.<br>
Being able to spend large amounts of money just to walk around Israel is nice, but it's not the location that is most important.<br>
Being able to actually stand at the wailing wall, and wear a silly round hat that is not mentioned in the Bible at all,<br>
and being able to stand there at that wall and bob your head like a parrot, that might be nice, but it's not important.<br>
You could have helped many families in need with all that money you just spent for you to go on your selfish little walk around Israel.<br>
How many hungry and homeless people did your aeroplane fly over on your way to and from Israel?<br>
It's not about the Israel location, or place, or church building, or church property.<br>
These places do have some importance, but what is more important, and most important, is the Word of the Lord, the words of Jesus Christ.<br>
It's the words.  Listen to the words and study the word of the Lord.<br>
Listen for him to speak to you.  Have eyes that see and ears that hear what the Spirit is saying.<br>
Listening, studying and taking in his words are always more important than your physical location.<br>
Your prayers right now, where you are right now, are just as well-heard and just as important as the<br>
prayers of those standing there at that wailing wall.<br>
And, you don't have to wear a silly, round hat, and bob your head like a parrot for him to hear your prayers right now.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Where is this high mountain where Jesus was transfigured before them?<br>
The Bible does not identify the name of the mountain, or the mountain's location, because the physical place was not important.<br>
<br>
Catholics think that it might be Mount Tabor, but they can't explain why.<br>
<br>
At its highest point, its Elevation is 575 metres (or 1,886 feet) above sea level.<br>
It is a mountain, but it is not a high mountain.  The Bible describes it as a high mountain.<br>
Mount Tabor is located in Lower Galilee, Israel, at the eastern end of the Jezreel Valley,<br>
18 kilometres (or, 11 miles) west of the Sea of Galilee.<br>
It is mentioned in the book of Joshua, and in the book of Judges.<br>
Mount Tabor is inside the Promised Land, east of Nazareth, and west of the Sea of Galilee,<br>
also known as the Sea of Kinereth.<br>
<br>
Others think that it could be Mount Hermon, because, in the previous chapter, in Matthew 16:13,<br>
they were near Caesarea Philippi. The Bible seems to indicate that, after they were in Caesarea Philippi<br>
for six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up<br>
into an high mountain apart, And was transfigured before them.<br>
Mount Hermon is the closest so-called high mountain, near Caesarea Philippi.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mount Hermon is a mountain cluster constituting the southern end of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range.<br>
Its summit straddles the border between Syria and Lebanon and,<br>
at 2,814 metres above sea level (9,232 feet above sea level), it is the highest point in Syria.<br>
<br>
Caesarea Philippi was an ancient Roman city located at the southwestern base of Mount Hermon.<br>
It was adjacent to a spring, grotto, and related shrines dedicated to the Greek god Pan.<br>
Now nearly uninhabited, Caesarea is an archaeological site in the Golan Heights,<br>
a region in the Levant, an approximate historical geographical term<br>
referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean region of Western Asia.<br>
<br>
Mount Tabor is a mountain, but not a high mountain, like Mount Hermon.<br>
Mount Hermon is 7,346 feet higher than Mount Tabor.<br>
The Bible did not just say, mountain; it said, high mountain.<br>
Mount Hermon is inside the Promised Land, near the eastern border.<br>
<br>
Both mountains are in the promised land.<br>
In either case, be it Mount Tabor or Mount Hermon, Moses is seen, standing there with Jesus in the promised land.<br>
Moses was not allowed to enter the promised land because of his sin,<br>
but he gets to go into the promised land anyway, because of Jesus.<br>
<br>
We were not allowed to enter heaven because of our sin,<br>
be we get to go to heaven anyway, because of Jesus.<br>

Commentary:<br>
We did a Bible study, titled, Rod, which was back in<br>
Christian Essays 6, also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 6.<br>
In that study, we looked at Bible verses that tell us to use a rod of correction.<br>
Let's put together some advice here on how to try to do that correcting in a good and proper way.<br>
Some things that we touched on in that previous study would include the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 22:15 (KJV)<br>
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 22:15 NLT:<br>
A youngster's heart is filled with foolishness,<br>
but physical discipline will drive it far away.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Use a rod.<br>
Do not use your hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24:6 KJV and<br>
Proverbs 11:14 KJV<br>
(in the)...multitude of counsellors there is safety.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Most of this information here is not in the Bible.<br>
This is an accumulation of some advice from various parents and families from several years ago.<br>
If you decide to seek the advice from several experienced Christian parents at your church or fellowship or Torah study or Bible study,<br>
this is an example of something that they might tell you.<br>
What works for one family may not exactly work for a different family.<br>
<br>
This is only an example of some advice.<br>
There are many questions and details not covered here, so you will need to consult your<br>
several experienced Christian parents, and get advice from several of them,<br>
if you have any unanswered questions after considering all of this.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, you are the parent, and what you choose to do or not do is entirely up to you.<br>
<br>
Some things you could say to your child,<br>
<br>
To obey is to do the exact same thing I am telling you to do.<br>
If you do something different than what I tell you, then that is not obeying.<br>
If you do something different first, and then obey, then that is not obeying first.<br>
<br>
Obey Quickly -- Obeying slowly is just as bad as disobeying.<br>
Obey First, Then Ask -- There may not be enough time to explain why you need to obey quickly.<br>
Obeying slowly is not obeying.<br>
Obey first, then we can talk about why later.<br>
<br>
If I see danger that you do not see,<br>
a car coming towards you, a bad person<br>
or a wild animal or a poisonous snake,<br>
I don't have time tell you why if you're about to get hit or bit.<br>
<br>
I might not spank you if you are angry or confused about why it is wrong.<br>
I can't spank you if I feel angry.<br>
Wait in your room, and we will talk about it and pray about it first.<br>
Let's talk about this.<br>
Why it was wrong.<br>
How you disobeyed.<br>
If this was to happen again, what you could look out for?<br>
Let's talk about what you could do differently next time so that you don't do it again, so that it does not happen to you again.<br>
<br>
One swat if it's your first time disobeying today.<br>
Two swats if you did it a second time today.<br>
<br>
Your spirit, and your attitude about the situation, plays a part in if your get one or two swats.<br>
Rebelling, arguing, talking back, squirming and fighting against me can make it worse.<br>
<br>
There may be a special circumstance or situation.<br>
When you talk to your child about it,<br>
Get the story from your child and see it from his or her perspective.<br>
Your child may reveal something to you that you did not see or consider.<br>
If there is a special interpretation of what happened, there can sometimes be<br>
special circumstances in which you should not spank.<br>
Carefully consider the spirit and the heart behind the matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Parents, don't do it quickly or out of emotion.<br>
Wait, calm down, pray with your spouse first,<br>
talk it over with your spouse first,<br>
then talk it over with your child first, and pray with your child.<br>
One parent told me that they, the child and the parents, would wait up to 30 minutes before the talk and the spank.<br>
<br>
After you are all done, you must forgive each other and move on.<br>
Don't bring it up again, unless you both need to talk about it again.<br>
Learn from your mistakes.<br>
If you don't learn from your mistakes, then you are doomed to repeat those mistakes again until you learn.<br>
<br>
Don't do it in public. CCTV cams are everywhere, even in car parks (parking lots).<br>
<br>
If you leave a visible mark on your child's skin, that stays longer than 10 minutes,<br>
that is too hard, and that can be abusive and illegal.<br>
You may need to apologise to your child and your spouse if you did it too hard.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, a child can go through a phase of being spanked almost every day.<br>
Then, suddenly, they rarely need any more spankings.<br>
When you get to be too old for spankings, remember this.<br>
When you become an adult, the real world will spank you if you disobey God and His commandments, and that disobedience will hurt longer and harder than a rod.<br>
<br>
All throughout the book of Proverbs, this concept is shown, again and again,<br>
The rod of correction removes foolishness and replaces it with wisdom.<br>
The foolishness will stay into the child's adult years if you do not drive it out with the rod.<br>
Again, the Bible teaches to Only use a rod -- Never use your hand.<br>
A rod can be some kind of short stick object, like a stick, or a large plastic spoon.<br>
A wooden spoon was commonly used in the 20th Century, until they were all replaced with large plastic spoons for<br>
stirring batter mixes and serving food.<br>
<br>
A father that loves his child will discipline, correct and punish their child.<br>
If you don't do that, then you do not really love them.<br>
<br>
The Heavenly Father loves us and He will discipline, correct and punish us if we keep on disobeying his commandments.<br>
We looked at some parts of these Bible verses in the Bible study, titled, BREED FETCH, in Christian Essays 1.<br>
We also looked at this part of Hebrews 12<br>
in the Bible study, titled, Gideon Prayer, which we recently studied earlier, here in this chapter, here on this page, here in Christian Essays 17.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 29:17 (KJV)<br>
Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; Yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 29:17 (NLT)<br>
Discipline your children, and they will give you peace of mind and will make your heart glad.<br>
<br>
(Proverbs) 29:17 (TS2009)<br>
Discipline your son, And he brings you rest and delight to your life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3: 11 & 12 (KJV)<br>
3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:<br>
3:12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3: 11 & 12 -- TS2009<br>
11 My son, do not despise the discipline of Yaw-Who-Wah, And do not loathe His reproof;<br>
12 For whom Yaw-Who-Wah loves He reproves, As a father the son whom he delights in.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3: 11 & 12 -- NLT Hebrew Version<br>
11<br>
My child, don't reject the Lord's discipline,<br>
and don't be upset when he corrects you.<br>
12<br>
For the Lord corrects those he loves,<br>
just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3: 11 & 12 -- NLT Greek Version<br>
11<br>
My child, don't reject the Lord's discipline,<br>
and don't be upset when he corrects you.<br>
12<br>
For the Lord corrects those he loves,<br>
and he punishes those he accepts as his children.<br>
<br>
<br>
That Greek Version is also in Hebrews 12.<br>
Hebrews 12: 5 & 6 is quoting from the Greek Version of Proverbs 3: 11 & 12.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 5-11 -- KJV<br>
12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:<br>
12:6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.<br>
12:7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?<br>
12:8 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.<br>
12:9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?<br>
12:10 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.<br>
12:11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 5-11 -- NLT<br>
5<br>
(And have you forgotten the encouraging words God spoke to you as his sons?)<br>
And have you forgotten the encouraging words God spoke to you as his children? He said,<br>
(My son, don't make light of the Lord's discipline, and don't give up when he corrects you.)<br>
"My child, don't make light of the Lord's discipline,<br>
and don't give up when he corrects you.<br>
6<br>
For the Lord disciplines those he loves,<br>
and he punishes each one he accepts as his child."<br>
7 As you endure this divine discipline, remember that God is treating you as his own children. Who ever heard of a child who is never disciplined by its father?<br>
8 If God doesn't discipline you as he does all of his children, it means that you are illegitimate and are not really his children at all.<br>
9 Since we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us, shouldn't we submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits, and live forever?<br>
(shouldn't we submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits, and really live?)<br>
10 For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how. But God's discipline is always good for us, so that we might share in his holiness.<br>
11 No discipline is enjoyable whilst it is happening -- it's painful! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 12: 5-11 -- TS2009<br>
5 And you have forgotten the appeal which speaks to you as to sons, "My son, do not despise the discipline of Yaw-Who-Wah, nor faint when you are reproved by Him,<br>
6 for whom Yaw-Who-Wah loves, He disciplines, and flogs every son whom He receives."<br>
7 If you endure discipline, Elohim is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom a father does not discipline?<br>
8 But if you are without discipline, of which all have become sharers, then you are illegitimate and not sons.<br>
9 Moreover, we indeed had fathers of our flesh disciplining us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?<br>
10 For they indeed disciplined us for a few days as seemed best to them, but He does it for our profit, so that we might share His apartness.<br>
11 And indeed, no discipline seems pleasant at the time, but grievous, but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 8: 1-3 KJV<br>
1 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.<br>
2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.<br>
3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 8: 1-6 NLT<br>
1 "Be careful to obey all the commands I am giving you today. Then you will live and multiply, and you will enter and occupy the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors.<br>
2 Remember how the Lord your God led you through the wilderness for these forty years, humbling you and testing you to prove your character, and to find out whether or not you would obey his commands.<br>
3 Yes, he humbled you by letting you go hungry and then feeding you with manna, a food previously unknown to you and your ancestors. He did it to teach you that people do not live by bread alone; rather, we live by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.<br>
4 For all these forty years your clothes didn't wear out, and your feet didn't blister or swell.<br>
5 Think about it: Just as a parent disciplines a child, the Lord your God disciplines you for your own good.<br>
6 "So obey the commands of the Lord your God by walking in his ways and fearing him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Elohim is the word, God, in Hebrew. It is pronounced, ELL-Low-Heem.<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 8: 1-3 TS2009<br>
1 Guard to do every command which I command you today, that you might live, and shall increase, and go in, and shall possess the land of which Yaw-Who-Wah swore to your fathers.'<br>
2 "And you shall remember that Yaw-Who-Wah your Elohim led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, prove you, to know what is in your heart, whether you guard His commands or not.<br>
3 And He humbled you, and let you suffer hunger, and fed you with manna which you did not know nor did your fathers know, to make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but by every Word that comes from the mouth of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
Matthew 4:4 and Luke 4:4 both tell us that Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, quoted from this spot right here in Deuteronomy 8:3.<br>
Both Matthew and Luke tell us that, Jesus quoted from Deuteronomy 8:3 when responding to satan's Temptation, there in the part of the story that talks about The Temptation of Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:  The bread is the body is Jesus, Yaw-Who-Shaw, and the work that He finished on the cross using his body, and the word is the Torah that was spoken from the mouth of the Lord, Yaw-Who-Wah.  Man does not live by just Jesus and the work he did on the cross with his body, the bread.  He lives also by following and obeying Torah, the Bible, the commandments.  Man lives by receiving the work done by the bread of life and by obeying the commandments spoken by the Father and written down by Moses, the Torah, the Law, the commandments. Man does not live by the bread of life alone, but by also obeying the words spoken by God and written down by Moses.  It is from both of these things, doth man live. That man doth not live by the bread of life only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD Yaw-Who-Wah doth man live.<br>
<br>
Let every word, all of Him enter into all of you.<br>
Eat all of the Torah that became flesh and dwelt among us.<br>
