Commentary:  When you walk into a Martial Arts classroom, are you supposed to bow down to the room?<br>
Do you bow before you enter?<br>
Do you worship martial arts?<br>
<br>
2 Kings 17: 34 & 35 KJV<br>
34 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the Lord, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;<br>
35 With whom the Lord had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Kings 17: 33-35 NLT<br>
33 And though they worshipped the Lord, they continued to follow their own gods according to the religious customs of the nations from which they came.<br>
34 And this is still going on today. They continue to follow their former practices instead of truly worshipping the Lord and obeying the decrees, regulations, instructions, and commands he gave the descendants of Jacob, whose name he changed to Israel.<br>
35 For the Lord had made a covenant with the descendants of Jacob and commanded them: "Do not worship any other gods or bow before them or serve them or offer sacrifices to them.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
David has victory in the Battles against Four Philistine Giants, and then,<br>
in 2 Samuel 22, we look here at a little sample from David's Song of Praise.<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 22: 32-35 (KJV)<br>
32 For who is God, save the Lord? and who is a rock, save our God?<br>
33 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.<br>
(He riddeth my way perfect.)<br>
(He looseth my way perfect.)<br>
<br>
(He equalleth my feet like hinds' feet)<br>
34 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.<br>
<br>
(He teacheth my hands for the war)<br>
35 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 22: 26-37 (NLT)<br>
26<br>
"To the faithful you show yourself faithful;<br>
to those with integrity you show integrity.<br>
27<br>
To the pure you show yourself pure,<br>
but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.<br>
28<br>
You rescue the humble,<br>
but your eyes watch the proud and humiliate them.<br>
29<br>
O Lord, you are my lamp.<br>
The Lord lights up my darkness.<br>
30<br>
In your strength I can crush an army;<br>
with my God I can scale any wall.<br>
31<br>
"God's way is perfect.<br>
All the Lord's promises prove true.<br>
He is a shield for all who look to him for protection.<br>
32<br>
For who is God except the Lord?<br>
Who but our God is a solid rock?<br>
33<br>
God is my strong fortress,<br>
and he makes my way perfect.<br>
34<br>
He makes me as surefooted as a deer,<br>
enabling me to stand on mountain heights.<br>
35<br>
He trains my hands for battle;<br>
he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze bow.<br>
36<br>
You have given me your shield of victory;<br>
(your answering has made me great)<br>
your help has made me great.<br>
37<br>
You have made a wide path for my feet<br>
to keep them from slipping.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 18: 31-35 (KJV)<br>
31 For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God?<br>
32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.<br>
33 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.<br>
34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.<br>
35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.<br>
(and with thy meekness thou hast multiplied me.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 18: 31-35 (NLT)<br>
31<br>
For who is God except the Lord?<br>
Who but our God is a solid rock?<br>
32<br>
God arms me with strength,<br>
and he makes my way perfect.<br>
33<br>
He makes me as surefooted as a deer,<br>
enabling me to stand on mountain heights.<br>
34<br>
He trains my hands for battle;<br>
he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze bow.<br>
35<br>
You have given me your shield of victory.<br>
Your right hand supports me;<br>
your help has made me great.<br>
(your humility has made me great.)<br>
<br>

The end of the book of Habakkuk, the end of chapter 3,<br>
the end of Habakkuk's Prayer...<br>
<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 3:17-19 (KJV)<br>
17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; (the labour of the olive shall lie,) the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:<br>
18 Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.<br>
19 The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.<br>
(To the overseer on my Neginoth.)<br>
<br>
Habakkuk 3:17-19 (NLT)<br>
17<br>
Even though the fig trees have no blossoms,<br>
and there are no grapes on the vines;<br>
even though the olive crop fails,<br>
and the fields lie empty and barren;<br>
even though the flocks die in the fields,<br>
and the cattle barns are empty,<br>
18<br>
yet I will rejoice in the Lord!<br>
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!<br>
19<br>
The Sovereign Lord is my strength!<br>
He makes me as surefooted as a deer,<br>
able to tread upon the heights.<br>
(He gives me the speed of a deer, able to tread upon the heights.)<br>
(For the choir director: This prayer is to be accompanied by stringed instruments.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3: 19-26 (KJV)<br>
19 The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.<br>
(by understanding hath he prepared the heavens.)<br>
<br>
20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.<br>
21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:<br>
22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.<br>
23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.<br>
24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.<br>
25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.<br>
26 For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 3: 19-26 (NLT)<br>
19<br>
By wisdom the Lord founded the earth;<br>
by understanding he created the heavens.<br>
20<br>
By his knowledge the deep fountains of the earth burst forth,<br>
and the dew settles beneath the night sky.<br>
21<br>
My child, don't lose sight of common sense and discernment.<br>
Hang on to them,<br>
22<br>
for they will refresh your soul.<br>
They are like jewels on a necklace.<br>
23<br>
They keep you safe on your way,<br>
and your feet will not stumble.<br>
24<br>
You can go to bed without fear;<br>
you will lie down and sleep soundly.<br>
25<br>
You need not be afraid of sudden disaster<br>
or the destruction that comes upon the wicked,<br>
26<br>
for the Lord is your security.<br>
He will keep your foot from being caught in a trap.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4: 10-19 (KJV)<br>
10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.<br>
11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.<br>
12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.<br>
13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.<br>
14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.<br>
15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.<br>
16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.<br>
17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.<br>
18 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.<br>
19 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 4: 10-19 (NLT)<br>
10<br>
(My son,) My child, listen to me and do as I say,<br>
and you will have a long, good life.<br>
11<br>
I will teach you wisdom's ways<br>
and lead you in straight paths.<br>
12<br>
When you walk, you won't be held back;<br>
when you run, you won't stumble.<br>
13<br>
Take hold of my instructions; don't let them go.<br>
Guard them, for they are the key to life.<br>
14<br>
Don't do as the wicked do,<br>
and don't follow the path of evildoers.<br>
15<br>
Don't even think about it; don't go that way.<br>
Turn away and keep moving.<br>
16<br>
For evil people can't sleep until they've done their evil deed for the day.<br>
They can't rest until they've caused someone to stumble.<br>
17<br>
They eat the food of wickedness<br>
and drink the wine of violence!<br>
18<br>
The way of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn,<br>
which shines ever brighter until the full light of day.<br>
19<br>
But the way of the wicked is like total darkness.<br>
They have no idea what they are stumbling over.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2: 4-8 (KJV)<br>
4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,<br>
5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.<br>
6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.<br>
7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,<br>
8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Peter 2: 4-8 (NLT)<br>
4<br>
You are coming to Christ, who is the living cornerstone of God's temple. He was rejected by people, but he was chosen by God for great honour.<br>
5<br>
And you are living stones that God is building into his spiritual temple.<br>
<br>
(What's more, you are his holy priesthood.)<br>
What's more, you are his holy priests. Through the mediation of Jesus Christ, you offer spiritual sacrifices that please God.<br>
6<br>
As the Scriptures say,<br>
(I am placing a cornerstone in Zion,)<br>
"I am placing a cornerstone in Jerusalem,<br>
chosen for great honour,<br>
and anyone who trusts in him<br>
will never be disgraced."<br>
(a quote from the book of Isaiah 28:16, Greek version.)<br>
<br>
7<br>
(Yes, for you who believe, there is honour.)<br>
Yes, you who trust him recognise the honour God has given him. But for those who reject him,<br>
"The stone that the builders rejected<br>
has now become the cornerstone."<br>
(a quote from the book of Psalms 118:22)<br>
8<br>
And, (quoting next from Isaiah 8:14)<br>
"He is the stone that makes people stumble,<br>
the rock that makes them fall."<br>
They stumble because they do not obey God's word, and so they meet the fate that was planned for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28:16 KJV<br>
28:16 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28:16 NLT<br>
(Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: "Look! I am placing a foundation stone in Zion, a firm and tested stone.)<br>
16<br>
Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says:<br>
"Look! I am placing a foundation stone in Jerusalem,<br>
a firm and tested stone.<br>
It is a precious cornerstone that is safe to build on.<br>
Whoever believes need never be shaken.<br>
<br>
The Greek Version of Isaiah 28:16 NLT says this...<br>
(Look! I am placing a stone in the foundation of Zion.)<br>
(Look! I am placing a stone in the foundation of Jerusalem, a precious cornerstone for its foundation, chosen for great honour.)<br>
(Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.)<br>
(This Greek translation of this verse, gets quoted in Romans 9:33, and, as we just saw a moment ago, it also is quoted in 1 Peter 2:6.)<br>
<br>
We will read some more out of Isaiah 28 here in just a moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 118: 21-25 KJV<br>
118:21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.<br>
118:22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.<br>
(This is from the LORD; it is marvellous in our eyes.)<br>
118:23 This is the LORD'S doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.<br>
118:24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.<br>
118:25 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 118: 21-25 NLT<br>
21<br>
I thank you for answering my prayer<br>
and giving me victory!<br>
22<br>
The stone that the builders rejected<br>
has now become the cornerstone.<br>
23<br>
This is the Lord's doing,<br>
and it is wonderful to see.<br>
24<br>
This is the day the Lord has made.<br>
We will rejoice and be glad in it.<br>
25<br>
Please, Lord, please save us.<br>
Please, Lord, please give us success.<br>

Isaiah 8: 11-16 (KJV)<br>
<br>
(For the Lord spake thus to me in strength of hand,)<br>
11 For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,<br>
12 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.<br>
13 Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.<br>
14 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<br>
15 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.<br>
16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 8: 11-16 (NLT)<br>
11<br>
The Lord has given me a strong warning not to think like everyone else does. He said,<br>
12<br>
"Don't call everything a conspiracy, like they do,<br>
and don't live in dread of what frightens them.<br>
13<br>
Make the Lord of Heaven's Armies holy in your life.<br>
He is the one you should fear.<br>
He is the one who should make you tremble.<br>
14<br>
He will keep you safe.<br>
But to Israel and Judah<br>
he will be a stone that makes people stumble,<br>
a rock that makes them fall.<br>
And for the people of Jerusalem<br>
he will be a trap and a snare.<br>
15<br>
Many will stumble and fall,<br>
never to rise again.<br>
They will be snared and captured."<br>
16<br>
Preserve the teaching of God;<br>
entrust his instructions to those who follow me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This next bit of Scripture was talking about the covenant that the Lord of hosts, the Lord of Heaven's Armies, made with the Levites.<br>
This is talking about God's covenant with Levi and his descendants, the Levites.<br>
<br>
Malachi 2: 5-9 (KJV)<br>
5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.<br>
6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.<br>
7 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.<br>
<br>
<br>
8 But ye are departed out of the way;<br>
<br>
ye have caused many to stumble at the law;<br>
(ye have caused many to fall in the law; )<br>
<br>
ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.<br>
(ye have not kept my ways, but lifted up the face against the law.)<br>
(ye have not kept my ways, but accepted faces in the law.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Malachi 2: 5-9 (NLT)<br>
5 "The purpose of my covenant with the Levites was to bring life and peace, and that is what I gave them. This required reverence from them, and they greatly revered me and stood in awe of my name.<br>
6 They passed on to the people the truth of the instructions they received from me. They did not lie or cheat; they walked with me, living good and righteous lives, and they turned many from lives of sin.<br>
7 "The words of a priest's lips should preserve knowledge of God, and people should go to him for instruction, for the priest is the messenger of the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
8 But you priests have left God's paths. Your instructions have caused many to stumble into sin. You have corrupted the covenant I made with the Levites," says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
9 "So I have made you despised and humiliated in the eyes of all the people. For you have not obeyed me but have shown favouritism in the way you carry out my instructions."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28:1-13 (KJV)<br>
1 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them (that are broken with wine,) that are overcome with wine!<br>
<br>
2 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.<br>
3 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, (shall be trodden with feet,) shall be trodden under feet:<br>
<br>
<br>
4 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth,<br>
(whilst it is yet in his hand he swalloweth it up,)<br>
whilst it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,<br>
6 And for a spirit of judgement to him that sitteth in judgement, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.<br>
7 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgement.<br>
8 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 Whom shall he teach knowledge?<br>
(and whom shall he make to understand the hearing?)<br>
and whom shall he make to understand doctrine?<br>
them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.<br>
<br>
(For precept hath been upon precept, precept upon precept;)<br>
10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept;<br>
<br>
line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:<br>
<br>
<br>
(For with stammerings of lip and another tongue he hath spoken to this people.)<br>
11 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.<br>
<br>
12 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.<br>
13 But the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.<br>
<br>

Commentary:  Do you read through your entire Bible, through all of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament?<br>
When was the last time you read all of the 66 books in the Holy Bible?<br>
Or do you just read a little verse here and a little verse there,<br>
one verse here and one verse there?<br>
Do you read a book at a time, a chapter at a time, a page a day?<br>
Or, do you just a read a verse at a time, here a little and there a little?<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 28:1-13 (NLT)<br>
<br>
(What sorrow awaits the crowning glory of the drunks of Ephraim,<br>
which is referring to Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom of Israel.)<br>
1<br>
What sorrow awaits the proud city of Samaria --<br>
the glorious crown of the drunks of Israel.<br>
It sits at the head of a fertile valley,<br>
but its glorious beauty will fade like a flower.<br>
It is the pride of a people<br>
brought down by wine.<br>
2<br>
For the Lord will send a mighty army against it.<br>
Like a mighty hailstorm and a torrential rain,<br>
they will burst upon it like a surging flood<br>
and smash it to the ground.<br>
3<br>
The proud city of Samaria --<br>
the glorious crown of the drunks of Israel --<br>
(the crowning glory of the drunks of Ephraim,)<br>
will be trampled beneath its enemies' feet.<br>
4<br>
It sits at the head of a fertile valley,<br>
but its glorious beauty will fade like a flower.<br>
Whoever sees it will snatch it up,<br>
as an early fig is quickly picked and eaten.<br>
5<br>
Then at last the Lord of Heaven's Armies<br>
will himself be Israel's glorious crown.<br>
He will be the pride and joy<br>
of the remnant of his people.<br>
6<br>
He will give a longing for justice<br>
to their judges.<br>
He will give great courage<br>
to their warriors who stand at the gates.<br>
7<br>
Now, however, Israel is led by drunks<br>
who reel with wine and stagger with alcohol.<br>
The priests and prophets stagger with alcohol<br>
and lose themselves in wine.<br>
They reel when they see visions<br>
and stagger as they render decisions.<br>
8<br>
Their tables are covered with vomit;<br>
filth is everywhere.<br>
9<br>
"Who does the Lord think we are?" they ask.<br>
"Why does he speak to us like this?<br>
Are we little children,<br>
just recently weaned?<br>
10<br>
He tells us everything over and over --<br>
one line at a time,<br>
one line at a time,<br>
a little here,<br>
and a little there!"<br>
11<br>
So now God will have to speak to his people<br>
through foreign oppressors who speak a strange language!<br>
12<br>
God has told his people,<br>
"Here is a place of rest;<br>
let the weary rest here.<br>
This is a place of quiet rest."<br>
But they would not listen.<br>
13<br>
So the Lord will spell out his message for them again,<br>
one line at a time,<br>
one line at a time,<br>
a little here,<br>
and a little there,<br>
so that they will stumble and fall.<br>
They will be injured, trapped, and captured.<br>
<br>

23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.<br>
24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37: 23 & 24 (NLT)<br>

Though they stumble, they will never fall,<br>
for the Lord holds them by the hand.<br>

<br>

Great peace have those loving Your Torah, And for them there is no stumbling-block.<br>

Psalms 121: 1-3 (KJV)<br>
(Shall I lift up mine eyes to the hills? whence should my help come?)<br>
1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.<br>
2 My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.<br>
3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.<br>
<br>
Psalms 121:1-3 (NLT)<br>
(A Song of degrees. A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem.)<br>
1<br>
I look up to the mountains --<br>
does my help come from there?<br>
2<br>
My help comes from the Lord,<br>
who made heaven and earth!<br>
3<br>
He will not let you stumble;<br>
the one who watches over you will not slumber.<br>
<br>
<br>
We read Proverbs 3:23 earlier.<br>
Remember once again, that, by receiving from the Lord,<br>

Proverbs 3:23 (KJV)<br>
Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.<br>
<br>

They keep you safe on your way, and your feet will not stumble.<br>

A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health.<br>

An unreliable messenger stumbles into trouble, but a reliable messenger brings healing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24: 15-22 (KJV)<br>
15 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:<br>
16 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.<br>
17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:<br>
(Lest the Lord see it, and it be evil in his eyes, and he turn away his wrath from him.)<br>
18 Lest the Lord see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.<br>
<br>
(Keep not company with the wicked, neither be thou envious at the wicked;)<br>
19 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked;<br>
<br>
(For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.)<br>
20 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.<br>
<br>
21 My son, fear thou the Lord and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:<br>
(meddle not with changers:)<br>
22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 24: 15-22 (NLT)<br>
15<br>
Don't wait in ambush at the home of the godly,<br>
and don't raid the house where the godly live.<br>
16<br>
The godly may trip seven times, but they will get up again.<br>
But one disaster is enough to overthrow the wicked.<br>
17<br>
Don't rejoice when your enemies fall;<br>
don't be happy when they stumble.<br>
18<br>
For the Lord will be displeased with you<br>
and will turn his anger away from them.<br>
19<br>
Don't fret because of evildoers;<br>
don't envy the wicked.<br>
20<br>
For evil people have no future;<br>
the light of the wicked will be snuffed out.<br>
21<br>
My child, fear the Lord and the king.<br>
Don't associate with rebels,<br>
22<br>
for disaster will hit them suddenly.<br>
Who knows what punishment will come<br>
from the Lord and the king?<br>

Psalms 27: 1 & 2 (KJV)<br>
1 The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?<br>

when my enemies and foes attack me,<br>
they will stumble and fall.<br>

Matthew 21: 42-44 (KJV)<br>
42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?<br>
43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.<br>
44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 21: 42-44 (NLT)<br>
42 Then Jesus asked them, "Didn't you ever read this in the Scriptures?<br>
'The stone that the builders rejected<br>
has now become the cornerstone.<br>
This is the Lord's doing,<br>
and it is wonderful to see.'<br>
(quoting from Psalms 118: 22 & 23)<br>
43 I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce the proper fruit.<br>
44 Anyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on."<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 20: 17 & 18 (KJV)<br>
17 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?<br>
18 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 20: 17 & 18 (NLT)<br>
17 Jesus looked at them and said, "Then what does this Scripture mean?<br>
'The stone that the builders rejected<br>
has now become the cornerstone.'<br>
(quoting from Psalms 118:22)<br>
18 Everyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on."<br>

<br>
1 Corinthians 8:9 (KJV)<br>
But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 8:9 (NLT)<br>
But you must be careful so that your freedom does not cause others with a weaker conscience to stumble.<br>
<br>

<br>
1 John 2: 9-17 (KJV)<br>
9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.<br>
10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.<br>
11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.<br>
12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.<br>
13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.<br>
14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.<br>
15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<br>
16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.<br>
17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 2: 9-17 (NLT)<br>
9 If anyone claims, "I am living in the light," (but hates his brother,) but hates a fellow believer, that person is still living in darkness.<br>
10 (Anyone who loves his brother,) Anyone who loves a fellow believer is living in the light and does not cause others to stumble.<br>
11 But anyone who hates a fellow believer is still living and walking in darkness. Such a person does not know the way to go, having been blinded by the darkness.<br>
12 I am writing to you who are God's children<br>
because your sins have been forgiven through Jesus.<br>
(because your sins have been forgiven through his name.)<br>
13<br>
(I am writing to you fathers,)<br>
I am writing to you who are mature in the faith<br>
because you know Christ, who existed from the beginning.<br>
I am writing to you who are young in the faith<br>
because you have won your battle with the evil one.<br>
14<br>
I have written to you who are God's children<br>
because you know the Father.<br>
I have written to you who are mature in the faith<br>
because you know Christ, who existed from the beginning.<br>
I have written to you who are young in the faith<br>
because you are strong.<br>
God's word lives in your hearts,<br>
and you have won your battle with the evil one.<br>
<br>
15 Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you.<br>
16 For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in our achievements and possessions. These are not from the Father, but are from this world.<br>
17 And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59: 11-19 (KJV)<br>
...we look for judgement, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.<br>
12 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;<br>
13 In transgressing and lying against the Lord, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.<br>
14 And judgement is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.<br>
<br>
(Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil is accounted mad: and the Lord saw it, and it was evil in his eyes that there was no judgement.)<br>
15 Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgement.<br>
16 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.<br>
17 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.<br>
<br>
18 (According to their recompenses,) According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.<br>
19 So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood,<br>
(the Spirit of the Lord shall put him to flight,)<br>
the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 59: 11-19 (NLT)<br>
...We look for justice, but it never comes.<br>
We look for rescue, but it is far away from us.<br>
12<br>
For our sins are piled up before God<br>
and testify against us.<br>
Yes, we know what sinners we are.<br>
13<br>
We know we have rebelled and have denied the Lord.<br>
We have turned our backs on our God.<br>
We know how unfair and oppressive we have been,<br>
carefully planning our deceitful lies.<br>
14<br>
Our courts oppose the righteous,<br>
and justice is nowhere to be found.<br>
Truth stumbles in the streets,<br>
and honesty has been outlawed.<br>
15<br>
Yes, truth is gone,<br>
and anyone who renounces evil is attacked.<br>
The Lord looked and was displeased<br>
to find there was no justice.<br>
16<br>
He was amazed to see that no one intervened<br>
to help the oppressed.<br>
So he himself stepped in to save them with his strong arm,<br>
and his justice sustained him.<br>
17<br>
He put on righteousness as his body armour<br>
and placed the helmet of salvation on his head.<br>
He clothed himself with a robe of vengeance<br>
and wrapped himself in a cloak of divine passion.<br>
18<br>
He will repay his enemies for their evil deeds.<br>
His fury will fall on his foes.<br>
He will pay them back even to the ends of the earth.<br>
19<br>
In the west, people will respect the name of the Lord;<br>
in the east, they will glorify him.<br>
For he will come like a raging flood tide<br>
driven by the breath of the Lord.<br>
(When the enemy comes like a raging flood tide,<br>
the Spirit of the Lord will drive him back.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 14: 10-13 (KJV)<br>
10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgement seat of Christ.<br>
11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.<br>
12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.<br>
13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 14: 10-13 (NLT)<br>
(So why do you condemn your brother?)<br>
10 So why do you condemn another believer? Why do you look down on another believer? Remember, we will all stand before the judgement seat of God.<br>
11 For the Scriptures say,<br>
"'As surely as I live,' says the Lord,<br>
'every knee will bend to me,<br>
and every tongue will declare allegiance to God.'"<br>
(every tongue will declare praise for God.)<br>
(There are two quotes right there, one from Isaiah 49:18, and the second part is from the Greek version of Isaiah 45:23.)<br>
<br>
12 Yes, each of us will give a personal account to God.<br>
13 So let's stop condemning each other. Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall.<br>

Better Than Sacrifice<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Exodus 17: 8-16 NLT<br>
8 Whilst the people of Israel were still at Rephidim, the warriors of Amalek attacked them.<br>
9 Moses commanded Joshua, "Choose some men to go out and fight the army of Amalek for us. Tomorrow, I will stand at the top of the hill, holding the staff of God in my hand."<br>
10 So Joshua did what Moses had commanded and fought the army of Amalek. Meanwhile, Moses, Aaron, and Hur climbed to the top of a nearby hill.<br>
11 As long as Moses held up the staff in his hand, the Israelites had the advantage. But whenever he dropped his hand, the Amalekites gained the advantage.<br>
12 Moses' arms soon became so tired he could no longer hold them up. So Aaron and Hur found a stone for him to sit on. Then they stood on each side of Moses, holding up his hands. So his hands held steady until sunset.<br>
13 As a result, Joshua overwhelmed the army of Amalek in battle.<br>
14 After the victory, the Lord instructed Moses, "Write this down on a scroll as a permanent reminder, and read it aloud to Joshua: I will erase the memory of Amalek from under heaven."<br>
15 Moses built an altar there and named it Yahweh-Nissi (which means "the Lord is my banner").<br>
<br>
(He said, "Hands have been lifted up to the Lord's throne, and now the Lord will be at war with Amalek generation after generation.")<br>
16 He said, "They have raised their fist against the Lord's throne, so now the Lord will be at war with Amalek generation after generation."<br>
<br>
<br>
Deuteronomy 25: 17-19 NLT<br>
17 "Never forget what the Amalekites did to you as you came from Egypt.<br>
18 They attacked you when you were exhausted and weary, and they struck down those who were straggling behind. They had no fear of God.<br>
19 Therefore, when the Lord your God has given you rest from all your enemies in the land he is giving you as a special possession, you must destroy the Amalekites and erase their memory from under heaven. Never forget this!<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, we will take a look at a story in 1 Samuel 15.<br>
When we read the parts that say to "utterly destroy" or, "completely destroy,"<br>
The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.<br>
King Saul is ordered to "utterly destroy" or, "completely destroy," the Amalekites, but, instead, he just Defeats them.<br>
Defeat is not the same as Destroy.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 15: 1-23 (KJV)<br>
1 Samuel also said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord.<br>
2 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.<br>
3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.<br>
4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.<br>
<br>
(And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and fought in the valley.)<br>
5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.<br>
6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.<br>
7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.<br>
8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.<br>
<br>
9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen,<br>
(and of the second sort,) and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.<br>
<br>
10 Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying,<br>
11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night.<br>
12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.<br>
13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord.<br>
14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?<br>
15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.<br>
16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.<br>
17 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel?<br>
<br>
18 And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.<br>
(and fight against them until they consume them.)<br>
<br>
19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord?<br>
20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.<br>
21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.<br>
22 And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.<br>
<br>
(For rebellion is as the sin of divination,)<br>
23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 15: 1-23 (NLT)<br>
1 One day Samuel said to Saul, "It was the Lord who told me to anoint you as king of his people, Israel. Now listen to this message from the Lord!<br>
2 This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies has declared: I have decided to settle accounts with the nation of Amalek for opposing Israel when they came from Egypt.<br>
3 Now go and completely destroy the entire Amalekite nation -- men, women, children, babies, cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and donkeys."<br>
4 So Saul mobilised his army at Telaim. There were 200,000 soldiers from Israel and 10,000 men from Judah.<br>
5 Then Saul and his army went to a town of the Amalekites and lay in wait in the valley.<br>
6 Saul sent this warning to the Kenites: "Move away from where the Amalekites live, or you will die with them. For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up from Egypt." So the Kenites packed up and left.<br>
7 Then Saul slaughtered the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, east of Egypt.<br>
8 He captured Agag, the Amalekite king, but completely destroyed everyone else.<br>
9 Saul and his men spared Agag's life and kept the best of the sheep and goats, the cattle, the fat calves, and the lambs -- everything, in fact, that appealed to them. They destroyed only what was worthless or of poor quality.<br>
10 Then the Lord said to Samuel,<br>
11 "I am sorry that I ever made Saul king, for he has not been loyal to me and has refused to obey my command." Samuel was so deeply moved when he heard this that he cried out to the Lord all night.<br>
12 Early the next morning Samuel went to find Saul. Someone told him, "Saul went to the town of Carmel to set up a monument to himself; then he went on to Gilgal."<br>
13 When Samuel finally found him, Saul greeted him cheerfully. "May the Lord bless you," he said. "I have carried out the Lord's command!"<br>
14 "Then what is all the bleating of sheep and goats and the lowing of cattle I hear?" Samuel demanded.<br>
15 "It's true that the army spared the best of the sheep, goats, and cattle," Saul admitted. "But they are going to sacrifice them to the Lord your God. We have destroyed everything else."<br>
16 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! Listen to what the Lord told me last night!"<br>
"What did he tell you?" Saul asked.<br>
17 And Samuel told him, "Although you may think little of yourself, are you not the leader of the tribes of Israel? The Lord has anointed you king of Israel.<br>
18 And the Lord sent you on a mission and told you, 'Go and completely destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, until they are all dead.'<br>
19 Why haven't you obeyed the Lord? Why did you rush for the plunder and do what was evil in the Lord's sight?"<br>
20 "But I did obey the Lord," Saul insisted. "I carried out the mission he gave me. I brought back King Agag, but I destroyed everyone else.<br>
21 Then my troops brought in the best of the sheep, goats, cattle, and plunder to sacrifice to the Lord your God in Gilgal."<br>
22<br>
But Samuel replied,<br>
"What is more pleasing to the Lord:<br>
your burnt offerings and sacrifices<br>
or your obedience to his voice?<br>
Listen! Obedience is better than sacrifice,<br>
and submission is better than offering the fat of rams.<br>
23<br>
Rebellion is as sinful as witchcraft,<br>
and stubbornness as bad as worshipping idols.<br>
So because you have rejected the command of the Lord,<br>
he has rejected you as king."<br>
<br>
<br>
And then, after that, the book of 1 Samuel tells us that,<br>
Saul Pleads for Forgiveness, even though it sounds kind of fake,<br>
Samuel Executes King Agag, and then, in the next chapter,<br>
Samuel Anoints David as the next King, but he does not start to be king just yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Because King Agag and the Amalekites were not destroyed completely, King Agag's offspring show up again later on.<br>
It seems that no one was keeping an eye on King Agag and what he was doing in the final moments before his death.<br>
One of his offspring ends up killing King Saul later on, and the other one we read about is Haman, the one who tries to destroy all the Jews in the story of Esther.<br>
Here is a little sample of this in the NLT...<br>
<br>
2 Samuel 1: 3-16 (NLT)<br>
3<br>
"Where have you come from?" David asked.<br>
"I escaped from the Israelite camp," the man replied.<br>
4<br>
"What happened?" David demanded. "Tell me how the battle went."<br>
The man replied, "Our entire army fled from the battle. Many of the men are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead."<br>
5<br>
"How do you know Saul and Jonathan are dead?" David demanded of the young man.<br>
6 The man answered, "I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear with the enemy chariots and charioteers closing in on him.<br>
7 When he turned and saw me, he cried out for me to come to him. 'How can I help?' I asked him.<br>
8<br>
"He responded, 'Who are you?'<br>
"'I am an Amalekite,' I told him.<br>
9 "Then he begged me, 'Come over here and put me out of my misery, for I am in terrible pain and want to die.'<br>
10 "So I killed him," the Amalekite told David, "for I knew he couldn't live. Then I took his crown and his armband, and I have brought them here to you, my lord."<br>
11 David and his men tore their clothes in sorrow when they heard the news.<br>
12 They mourned and wept and fasted all day for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the Lord's army and the nation of Israel, because they had died by the sword that day.<br>
13 Then David said to the young man who had brought the news, "Where are you from?"<br>
And he replied, "I am a foreigner, an Amalekite, who lives in your land."<br>
14 "Why were you not afraid to kill the Lord's anointed one?" David asked.<br>
15 Then David said to one of his men, "Kill him!" So the man thrust his sword into the Amalekite and killed him.<br>
16 "You have condemned yourself," David said, "for you yourself confessed that you killed the Lord's anointed one."<br>
<br>
<br>
Esther 9:24 (NLT)<br>
Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews, had plotted to crush and destroy them on the date determined by casting lots (the lots were called purim).<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look at a key thing that Samuel said when we were reading in the book of 1 Samuel 15...<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 15:22 (KJV)<br>
And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 15:22 (NLT)<br>
But Samuel replied, "What is more pleasing to the Lord: your burnt offerings and sacrifices or your obedience to his voice? Listen! Obedience is better than sacrifice, and submission is better than offering the fat of rams.<br>
<br>
<br>
This important concept is also mentioned and echoed throughout the Scriptures.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 1:11-18 KJV<br>
11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of (great) he goats.<br>
<br>
(When ye come to be seen before me,)<br>
12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?<br>
<br>
<br>
13 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies,<br>
I cannot away with; (it is grief,) it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.<br>
<br>
<br>
14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.<br>
<br>
15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea,<br>
(when ye multiply prayer, I will not hear: your hands are full of bloods.)<br>
when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.<br>
<br>
16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;<br>
<br>
17 Learn to do well; seek judgement,<br>
(righten the oppressed,) relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.<br>
<br>
18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 1:11-18 NLT<br>
11<br>
"What makes you think I want all your sacrifices?"<br>
says the Lord.<br>
"I am sick of your burnt offerings of rams<br>
and the fat of fattened cattle.<br>
I get no pleasure from the blood<br>
of bulls and lambs and goats.<br>
12<br>
When you come to worship me,<br>
who asked you to parade through my courts with all your ceremony?<br>
13<br>
Stop bringing me your meaningless gifts;<br>
the incense of your offerings disgusts me!<br>
As for your celebrations of the new moon and the Sabbath<br>
and your special days for fasting --<br>
they are all sinful and false.<br>
I want no more of your pious meetings.<br>
14<br>
I hate your new moon celebrations and your annual festivals.<br>
They are a burden to me. I cannot stand them!<br>
15<br>
When you lift up your hands in prayer, I will not look.<br>
Though you offer many prayers, I will not listen,<br>
for your hands are covered with the blood of innocent victims.<br>
16<br>
Wash yourselves and be clean!<br>
Get your sins out of my sight.<br>
Give up your evil ways.<br>
17<br>
Learn to do good.<br>
Seek justice.<br>
Help the oppressed.<br>
Defend the cause of orphans.<br>
Fight for the rights of widows.<br>
18<br>
"Come now, let's settle this,"<br>
says the Lord.<br>
"Though your sins are like scarlet,<br>
I will make them as white as snow.<br>
Though they are red like crimson,<br>
I will make them as white as wool.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 21:3 (KJV)<br>
To do justice and judgement is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 21:3 (NLT)<br>
The Lord is more pleased when we do what is right and just than when we offer him sacrifices.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 7: 21-23 KJV<br>
21 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.<br>
22 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning (the matter of) burnt offerings or sacrifices:<br>
23 But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 7: 21-23 NLT<br>
21 This is what the Lord of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: "Take your burnt offerings and your other sacrifices and eat them yourselves!<br>
22 When I led your ancestors out of Egypt, it was not burnt offerings and sacrifices I wanted from them.<br>
23 This is what I told them: 'Obey me, and I will be your God, and you will be my people. Do everything as I say, and all will be well!'<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 12: 32-34 KJV<br>
32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:<br>
33 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.<br>
34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.<br>
<br>
Mark 12: 32-34 NLT<br>
32 The teacher of religious law replied, "Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth by saying that there is only one God and no other.<br>
33 And I know it is important to love him with all my heart and all my understanding and all my strength, and to love my neighbour as myself. This is more important than to offer all of the burnt offerings and sacrifices required in the law."<br>
34 Realising how much the man understood, Jesus said to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God." And after that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 9:13 (KJV)<br>
But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 9:13 (NLT)<br>
Then he added, "Now go and learn the meaning of this Scripture: 'I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices.'<br>
(Quoting from the Greek version of Hosea 6:6)<br>
For I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners."<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself.<br>
The Greek version of Hosea 6:6 is quoted again in Matthew 12:7...<br>
<br>
Matthew 12: 5-8 KJV<br>
5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?<br>
6 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.<br>
7 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.<br>
8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.<br>
<br>
Matthew 12: 5-8 NLT<br>
5 And haven't you read in the law of Moses that the priests on duty in the Temple may work on the Sabbath?<br>
6 I tell you, there is one here who is even greater than the Temple!<br>
7 But you would not have condemned my innocent disciples if you knew the meaning of this Scripture: 'I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices.'<br>
8 For the Son of Man is Lord, even over the Sabbath!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 2: 1-5 KJV<br>
...we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:<br>
2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.<br>
3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.<br>
4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.<br>
5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 2: 1-5 NLT<br>
...we have an advocate who pleads our case before the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the one who is truly righteous.<br>
2 He himself is the sacrifice that atones for our sins -- and not only our sins but the sins of all the world.<br>
3 And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.<br>
4 If someone claims, "I know God," but doesn't obey God's commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth.<br>
5 But those who obey God's word truly show how completely they love him. That is how we know we are living in him.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14:15 (KJV)<br>
If ye love me, keep my commandments.<br>
<br>
John 14:15 (NLT)<br>
"If you love me, obey my commandments.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14: 23 & 24 KJV<br>
23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.<br>
24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings....<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14: 23 & 24 NLT<br>
23 Jesus replied, "All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them. <br>
24 Anyone who doesn't love me will not obey me....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 40: 6-8 (KJV)<br>
6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; (mine ears hast thou digged) mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.<br>
7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,<br>
8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.<br>
(I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is in the midst of my bowels.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 40: 6-8 NLT<br>
(You take no delight in sacrifices or offerings. Now that you have made me listen, You have given me a body -- you don't require burnt offerings or sin offerings.)<br>
6<br>
You take no delight in sacrifices or offerings.<br>
Now that you have made me listen, I finally understand --<br>
you don't require burnt offerings or sin offerings.<br>
7<br>
Then I said, "Look, I have come.<br>
As is written about me in the Scriptures:<br>
8<br>
I take joy in doing your will, my God,<br>
for your instructions are written on my heart."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Greek Version of what we just read, Psalms 40: 6-8, is mentioned in Hebrews 10:5-7<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:5-10 KJV<br>
5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:<br>
6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.<br>
7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.<br>
8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;<br>
9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.<br>
10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:5-10 NLT<br>
5<br>
That is why, when Christ came into the world, (when he came into the world,) he said to God,<br>
"You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings.<br>
But you have given me a body to offer.<br>
6<br>
You were not pleased with burnt offerings<br>
or other offerings for sin.<br>
7<br>
Then I said, 'Look, I have come to do your will, O God --<br>
as is written about me in the Scriptures.'"<br>
8 First, Christ said, "You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings or burnt offerings or other offerings for sin, nor were you pleased with them" (though they are required by the law of Moses).<br>
9 Then he said, "Look, I have come to do your will." He cancels the first covenant in order to put the second into effect.<br>
10 For God's will was for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 51: 15-17 (KJV)<br>
15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.<br>
16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; (that I should give it,) else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.<br>
17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 51: 15-17 (NLT)<br>
15<br>
Unseal my lips, O Lord,<br>
that my mouth may praise you.<br>
16<br>
You do not desire a sacrifice, or I would offer one.<br>
You do not want a burnt offering.<br>
17<br>
The sacrifice you desire is a broken spirit.<br>
You will not reject a broken and repentant heart, O God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 6:6 (KJV)<br>
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.<br>
<br>
Hosea 6:6 (NLT)<br>
(I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices. I want you to know God more than I want burnt offerings.)<br>
I want you to show love, not offer sacrifices. I want you to know me more than I want burnt offerings.<br>
<br>
The Greek version of Hosea 6:6 says, I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices.<br>
It was the Greek version that got quoted, when we read that earlier, in Matthew 9:13, and in Matthew 12:7.<br>

Micah 6: 6-8 KJV<br>
6 Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God?<br>
(shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with sons of a year?)<br>
shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?<br>
<br>
7 Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?<br>
shall I give my firstborn for my transgression,<br>
(the fruit of my belly for the sin of my soul?)<br>
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?<br>
<br>
8 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,<br>
(and to humble thyself to walk with thy God?)<br>
and to walk humbly with thy God?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Micah 6: 6-8 NLT<br>
6<br>
What can we bring to the Lord?<br>
Should we bring him burnt offerings?<br>
Should we bow before God Most High<br>
with offerings of yearling calves?<br>
7<br>
Should we offer him thousands of rams<br>
and ten thousand rivers of olive oil?<br>
Should we sacrifice our firstborn children<br>
to pay for our sins?<br>
8<br>
No, O people, the Lord has told you what is good,<br>
and this is what he requires of you:<br>
to do what is right, to love mercy,<br>
and to walk humbly with your God.<br>
<br>

<br>
We are getting close to the end of this Bible Study, but, before we do, here's a little something extra to think about.<br>
Did you ever wonder why King Saul disobeyed the Lord's commandment to completely and utterly destroy all of the Amalekites?<br>
He was supposed to destroy all people, all babies, children, adults, all animals, all objects, all things,<br>
and all buildings.  Every object and living thing was to be killed and destroyed completely, burning it all by fire.<br>
Why did King Saul disobey? 1st Samuel chapter 15 tells us why.  Let's go back to that chapter again and take a look...<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 15: 7-9 KJV<br>
7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.<br>
8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.<br>
9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, (and of the second sort) and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 15: 7-9 NLT<br>
7 Then Saul slaughtered the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, east of Egypt.<br>
8 He captured Agag, the Amalekite king, but completely destroyed everyone else.<br>
9 Saul and his men spared Agag's life and kept the best of the sheep and goats, the cattle, the fat calves, and the lambs—everything, in fact, that appealed to them. They destroyed only what was worthless or of poor quality.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 15: 24-26 KJV<br>
24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.<br>
25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord.<br>
26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Samuel 15: 24-26 NLT<br>
24 Then Saul admitted to Samuel, "Yes, I have sinned. I have disobeyed your instructions and the Lord's command, for I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded.<br>
25 But now, please forgive my sin and come back with me so that I may worship the Lord."<br>
26 But Samuel replied, "I will not go back with you! Since you have rejected the Lord's command, he has rejected you as king of Israel."<br>
<br>
and then, later, in verse 33, Samuel Executes King Agag<br>
and then, in Chapter 16, Samuel Anoints David as King, and David Serves in Saul's Court,<br>
David became King Saul's armour bearer, and was a talented harp player, playing the harp for King Saul,<br>
because King Saul was troubled by a tormenting spirit from God, and the tormenting spirit would go away when David played the harp.<br>
which is all mentioned at the end of 1 Samuel, Chapter 16.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
Why did King Saul disobey the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah?<br>
King Saul tells us why, in Verse 24.<br>
I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.<br>
I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded.<br>
Are we talking about King Saul, or are we talking about Christian Church Services on Sunday, serving barbecued Hot Dogs after the service?<br>
Disobeying Saturday Sabbath, working, shopping, buying and selling on Saturday, bowing down to the Pagan, Babylonian Christmas Tree god to pick up the Christmas present,<br>
Easter, Harvest Festival, bacon before church, ham sandwiches and hot dogs after service, not actually teaching what Biblical fellowship really is,<br>
Never ever reading all of Leviticus chapter 18 out loud to the entire congregation,<br>
especially Leviticus chapter 18, verse 22, never reading the Ten Commandments out loud to the entire congregation,<br>
never even reading the Old Testament any more.<br>
Instead, regardless of whether they know or not know of the ingredients, they encourage and promote the strong delusion of the receiving of an &#x69;&#x6E;&#x6A;ection that permanently installs a full satanic ritual, causing unclean spiritual defilement, pollution, and modification.<br>
If you knew of the secret ingredients, you would know that this is true, that there is an entire satanic ritual of defilement in that mandated &#x69;&#x6E;&#x6A;ection.<br>
Why are Christian pastors disobeying the Lord's Commandments?<br>
If they were to tell the truth, the pastors would honestly say,<br>
I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.<br>
I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded.<br>
I was afraid of lawsuits and government persecutions,<br>
I was afraid of attendance going down, and not enough money coming in, so I gave them what they wanted to hear, and avoided the content, the truth that would make them offended and not come back next Sunday.<br>
<br>
Throughout this chapter of 1 Samuel 15, there were several verses that indicate that King Saul was obsessed with the sacrificing as a religious visual presentation, as if the visual performance of his religious involvement was more important than what was going on in his heart.<br>
He wanted to put on a good show, and be a religious show-off.  That public, visual performance of the religious church service with the animal sacrifice and public, visual display of his worshipping in front of an audience, giving the audience a good show so that they like him and accept him, that was all more important to Saul than his commandment obedience.  He was teaching the people that your religious ritual visibility was more important than your actual commandment obedience. This attitude and perspective is sinful, and it can just push me or you away from the Lord Yaw-Who-Wah, separating me or you away from him with a sinful, selfish attitude.<br>
<br>
One more time, let's remember and study these verses again...<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:9 -- The Scriptures 2009 translation (TS2009) (1993, 2009, 2015)<br>
He who turns away his ear from hearing the Torah, Even his prayer is an abomination.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:9 (KJV)<br>
He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:9 NLT:<br>
God detests the prayers of a person who ignores the law.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14: Verse 15, 21, 23 and 24 -- KJV<br>
15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.<br>
21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.<br>
23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.<br>
24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings....<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14: Verse 15, 21, 23 and 24 -- NLT<br>
(If you love me, you will obey my commandments. If you love me, you should obey my commandments.)<br>
15 "If you love me, obey my commandments.<br>
21 Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them."<br>
23 Jesus replied, "All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.<br>
24 Anyone who doesn't love me will not obey me....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 19-24 (KJV)<br>
19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.<br>
20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.<br>
21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.<br>
22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?<br>
23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.<br>
24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 19-24 NLT<br>
19 So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.<br>
20 Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify people by their actions.<br>
21 "Not everyone who calls out to me, 'Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.<br>
22 On judgement day many will say to me, 'Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.'<br>
23 But I will reply, 'I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God's laws.'<br>
24 "Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 7: 19-24 -- TS2009<br>
19 "Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.<br>
20 "So then, by their fruits you shall know them --<br>
21 "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Master, Master,' shall enter into the reign of the heavens, but he who is doing the desire of My Father in the heavens.<br>
22 "Many shall say to Me in that day, 'Master, Master, have we not prophesied in Your Name, and cast out demons in Your Name, and done many mighty works in Your Name?'<br>
23 "And then I shall declare to them, 'I never knew you, depart from Me, you who work lawlessness!'<br>
24 "Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does them, shall be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 1:9 KJV<br>
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
<br>
1 John 1: 5-10 NLT<br>
...God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.<br>
6 So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness; we are not practising the truth.<br>
7 But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.<br>
8 If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth.<br>
9 But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.<br>
10 If we claim we have not sinned, we are calling God a liar and showing that his word has no place in our hearts.<br>
<br>
Commentary:  If you would just start by doing the confessing, he will do the cleansing, and he will show you where to safely make a U-turn and start going in right direction.  He will lead you to the U-turn spot and guide you in the right direction, as soon as you confess that you were going the wrong direction, and need his direction to know the way in which you should go.  It's called, repentance. He will kindly and lovingly lead you to the repentance U-turn spot, but you need to make the U-turn, repent, follow and obey his directions, his commandments, and don't look back.  Again, even if you have walked a thousand miles away from the Lord Jesus, Yaw-Who-Wah Yaw-Who-Shaw, He is still just one prayer away.<br>
You do the confessing, he will do the cleaning.<br>
<br>
1 John 1:9 TS2009<br>
If we confess our sins, He is trustworthy and righteous to forgive us the sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, as we now bring this Bible study to its conclusion, a little technical note, here. In the Hebrew text, Ecclesiastes 5:1 is found at the end of the previous chapter, chapter 4, verse 17.<br>
Ecclesiastes, chapter 4, verse 17, was moved over into chapter 5, and is seen today in our English Bibles as Ecclesiastes 5:1.<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 5: 1 & 2 KJV<br>
1 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.<br>
2 Be not rash with thy mouth,<br>
(and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any word before God,)<br>
and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God:<br>
for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 5: 1 & 2 NLT<br>
1 As you enter the house of God, keep your ears open and your mouth shut. It is evil to make mindless offerings to God.<br>
2 Don't make rash promises, and don't be hasty in bringing matters before God. After all, God is in heaven, and you are here on earth. So let your words be few.<br>

<a name="JAH20PRAYZYAW"></a><h2>Praise The Lord</h2>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Praise The Lord<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 95:6 (KJV)<br>
O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our maker.<br>
<br>
James 4:10 (KJV)<br>
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hallelujah!<br>
Praise God!<br>
Praise The Lord!<br>
Praise Yaw!<br>
Hallelujah!<br>
Hallelu-Yaw!<br>
Hallelu-Yaw-Who-Wah!<br>
Praise The Lord!<br>
Praise Yaw!<br>
<br>
Praise Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
<br>
In the English language, we see common first names that can have a full version, and a short version.<br>
For example,<br>
The short version of Robert is Rob.<br>
The short version of Michael is Mike.<br>
The short version of Timothy is Tim.<br>
The short version of Elisabeth is Liz (or Lizzy).<br>
<br>
It's the same thing with the actual Hebrew name of our God.<br>
<br>
The short version of Yaw-Who-Wah is Yaw.<br>
<br>
The way we see, Yaw, spelled, using English characters, is J, A, H.<br>
The English letter J makes the Y sound in the Hebrew language.<br>
So, if you see an English letter J in a Hebrew name, if you make it sound like a letter Y,<br>
with a, Yuh, sound, chances are, you are correct in making that sound for that name in the Hebrew language.<br>
<br>
So, it's really cool that, when you say Hallelujah, the Halle-Lew part is, Praise, in Hebrew,<br>
and the Yaw sound at the end, really is the name of our Lord God!<br>
So, when someone says, Hallelujah, they are saying the correct short-version name of the Lord God!<br>
The short version of Yaw-Who-Wah is Yaw!<br>
They are saying, Praise Yaw, in Hebrew, and they don't even know it!<br>
We even see the name of Yaw in Psalms 68:4.<br>
They tried to change the name to, the Lord, every place else, but they forgot about it being there in Psalms 68:4.<br>
We will read Psalms 68:4 again in just a moment.<br>
<br>
We are going to take another look at the English word, Hallelujah.<br>
This word is based on two Hebrew words being put together.<br>
<br>
To help pronounce and learn more about these two Hebrew words, and what they mean,<br>
we will once again consult the following two reference books.<br>
<br>
One is the Strong's Hebrew Lexicon,<br>
and the second one is the Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions.<br>
<br>
The first book, the Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Strong's Concordance, is a Bible concordance, an index of every word in the King James Version (KJV), constructed under the direction of James Strong, first published in 1890.<br>
<br>
And, the second reference book, titled, A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,<br>
is more commonly known as the Brown-Driver-Briggs or BDB, which is based on the name of its three authors.<br>
The BDB is a standard reference for Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, first published in the year 1906.<br>
<br>
When looking at how to pronounce the Hebrew words, and what they mean, we will be combining and presenting the information that came from these two reference books.<br>
<br>
When we were in Christian Essays 7,<br>
also known as The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 7,<br>
we did a Bible study, titled, The Name of the Lord.<br>
In that study, we talked for a moment about the word, Hallelujah.<br>
<br>
Hallelujah is the transliteration of a Hebrew term that means "Praise the Lord."<br>
<br>
We said, in that study, that,<br>
The English word, hallelujah, is commonly spelled, hallelujah, and this word, spelled this way, appears zero times in the KJV Bible.<br>
A more accurate way of spelling of it would be, halaluyah. The Hebrew word means, Praise the Lord, You Praise The Lord, You People Praise the Lord, Praise Ye the Lord, and Praise God.<br>
Praise God. Do that. Praise God. All of you. Everybody. Praise God.<br>
In other words, it is telling us, all of us, all people, that we all need to Praise the Lord.<br>
When it says, You Praise The Lord, it means, all of you, as if one is saying that to a large crowd of people.<br>
You are commanding this to the crowd of people when the speaker says to the audience, You Praise The Lord.<br>
Hallelujah is a command being given out to the audience, to the crowd of people, commanding them to Praise the Lord.<br>
The English word, hallelujah, spelled with, Yaw, Jah, J, A, H, at the end, is the way we see Jah spelled in Psalms 68:4.<br>
<br>
Psalms 68:4 (KJV)<br>
Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name Jah, and rejoice before him.<br>
<br>
One place where halaluyah was kept in an English form, in the KJV, was in Revelation 19, within verses 1 through 6, but in the KJV Bible, it was spelled, Alleluia, without the letter H.<br>
<br>
And then, in that study, we looked at the five occurrences of Alleluia,<br>
there in Revelation 19, verses 1 through 6.<br>
<br>
Let's look at the two Hebrew words that we have in, Hallelujah.<br>
<br>
The first one is pronounced, Hal-Lal, and the second word is, Yaw.<br>
<br>
The two words, together are, Hal-Lal, Yaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hal-Lal, means,<br>
to be clear<br>
to shine<br>
make a show; to boast, to rave, to celebrate<br>
to flash forth light, to praise, boast, be boastful<br>
be made praiseworthy, be commended, be worthy of praise<br>
to make a fool of, make into a fool, to act madly, act like a madman<br>
<br>
<br>
The second word, Yaw, -- is Jah, the sacred name of God, Short-version.<br>
Jah (Jehovah in the shortened form)<br>
the shortened form of Yaw-Who-Wah, from Yeh-Ho-Vah,<br>
which, in English, would be the word,<br>
Jehovah, the Lord.<br>
Yaw, -- Jah, is the short version of the sacred name, the proper name of the one true God.<br>
<br>
<br>
When the KJV encountered these two Hebrew words together, Hal-Lal, Yaw, in several cases they translated it into,<br>
Praise ye the Lord.<br>
So, we don't see Hallelujah, in the KJV, but we do see, Praise ye the Lord, which is what Hallelujah means.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are 27 examples from the KJV.<br>
When we get to Judges 5:2, we will stop and take a look at something interesting that's going on there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 135:1 (KJV)<br>
Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord.<br>
<br>
Psalms 148:1 (KJV)<br>
Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the heights.<br>
<br>
Psalms 146:1 (KJV)<br>
Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul.<br>
<br>
Psalms 113:1 (KJV)<br>
Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
Psalms 150:6 (KJV)<br>
Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.<br>
<br>
Psalms 135:21 (KJV)<br>
Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Judges 5:2 (KJV)<br>
Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.<br>
<br>
Even though the KJV said, Praise ye the Lord, here in Judges 5:2, the actual Hebrew words here, are different.<br>
<br>
Instead of Hal-Lal, Yaw, we have here in Judges 5:2, the two Hebrew words, Buh-wraah, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's look at the first word, Buh-wraah.<br>
The end of Buh-wraah sounds like the word, wrath, as in wrath of God,<br>
but the t, h, sound at the end is not there.<br>
So, take, Buh, and add the sound of wrath, but do not make the t,h, sound at the end,<br>
and you have, Buh-wraah.<br>
That vocal sound would be very close, but not exactly perfect,<br>
because there are some sounds in the Hebrew language<br>
that we can not make in the English language.<br>
Be that as it may, the word,<br>
Buh-wraah, means,<br>
to kneel, to bless God<br>
to bless, kneel, to be blessed, be adored, to praise, salute.<br>
<br>
And the second word is, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah, from Yeh-Ho-Vah, which, in English, would be the word,<br>
Jehovah, the Lord.<br>
Usually shown in ALL CAPS.<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah is the full-length version of God's actual, sacred name.<br>
Yaw-Who-Wah is the sacred name and proper name of the one true God, our Heavenly Father, the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many of the remaining 20 examples that we are about to read next, come from the Hebrew words, Buh-wraah, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
We would have to look up each example to see if, the English words, Praise ye the Lord, were originally,<br>
Buh-wraah, Yaw-Who-Wah,<br>
or,<br>
Hal-Lal, Yaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
Buh-wraah, Yaw-Who-Wah, is, Bless the Lord.<br>
Hal-Lal, Yaw, is, Praise the Lord.<br>
Bless Yaw-Who-Wah, Kneel before Yaw-Who-Wah, Praise Yaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
Buh-wraah, Yaw-Who-Wah, can be either, Praise ye the Lord, or, Bless the Lord, when translated into English in the KJV.<br>
<br>
Psalms 103:1 (KJV)<br>
Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.<br>
<br>
That right there, Bless the Lord, is Buh-wraah, Yaw-Who-Wah, which we also saw translated into Praise ye the Lord, in Judges 5:2.<br>
Isn't it interesting how, Buh-wraah, Yaw-Who-Wah sometimes becomes Praise ye the Lord,<br>
and at other times the same two words, Buh-wraah, Yaw-Who-Wah, get turned into, Bless the Lord.<br>
<br>
Bless the Lord, Praise the Lord, Kneel down before the Lord.  It's all good, and it is what we all need to do every day.<br>
<br>
Here are 19 remaining examples to look at next...<br>
<br>
Psalms 149:1 (KJV)<br>
Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.<br>
<br>
Psalms 105:45 (KJV)<br>
That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the Lord.<br>
<br>

Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.<br>
<br>
Psalms 116:19 (KJV)<br>
In the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.<br>
<br>

<br>
Psalms 147:1 (KJV)<br>
Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.<br>
<br>
Psalms 104:35 (KJV)<br>
Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. Praise ye the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 20:13 (KJV)<br>
Sing unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.<br>
<br>
I was curious about that last one, Jeremiah 20:13, so I looked it up and saw that, praise ye the Lord, originally was,<br>
Hal-Laal, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
That also can mean, Bless the Lord, and, Kneel down before the Lord.<br>
<br>
We will now finish up with the remaining six examples...<br>
<br>

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the Lord.<br>

<br>

Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.<br>
<br>

He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.<br>
<br>
Psalms 117:1 (KJV)<br>
O praise the Lord, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's finish up now with a quick prayer.<br>
Dear Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, show us what we can do for you each day.<br>
Save us, help us, and show us how to praise you, show us how to bless you, show us how to glorify you and your name.<br>
Help us walk in obedience according to your Torah, according to your will and according to your word.<br>
We thankfully receive your forgiveness, your righteousness and your salvation.<br>
Help us bless your name and your kingdom. Give us strength and your good wisdom from above. Bless us, heal us, and deliver us.<br>
We pray this in the name of Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw.  In Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, Ah-Main. Amen.<br>
Hallelujah!<br>

<br>
I love praying prayers like this.<br>
It reminds me of who He is, what He has done, what He is doing and what He is going to do.<br>
He is the first and the last, the beginning and the end, He is the one who was, and is, and is to come.<br>
<br>
Think about this next sentence.<br>
We can cast out and we can cast in.<br>
<br>
The Bible does not say this statement, exactly,<br>
but this concept is something that we can do in our prayers.<br>
So, taking that concept, and using some of the statements from the Bible study that we did, titled,<br>
Gideon Prayer, a study that we did back in Christian Essays 17, The Bible's Greatest Hits, chapter 17,<br>
Let's pray a prayer right now, asking the Lord Jesus to cast out what does not belong in us,<br>
and cast into us, bring into us, what we are deficient in, what we are lacking or missing,<br>
in our bodies, hearts, minds, souls, thoughts, desires, priorities, and attitudes.<br>
<br>
We can wash it out, and we can wash it in.<br>
We can cast out and we can cast in.<br>
We can pray it out and we can pray it in,<br>
but He is the one who casts it out, and He is the one who casts it in.<br>
<br>
Dear Yaw, ELL-Low-Heem, Yaw-Who-Wah, Yaw-Who-Shaw, Dear Lord Jesus,<br>
We thank you for living and dwelling in us.<br>
<br>
May your will, your power and your authority continue to be in<br>
our bodies, hearts, minds, souls, thoughts, desires, priorities, and attitudes.<br>
Cast out what does not belong, and create and breathe into us everything we need,<br>
whatever it is, be it something that is physical, mental, emotional, spiritual;<br>
provide for us our financial needs, our provisional needs, our physical needs, as well as our mental, emotional, and spiritual needs,<br>
whether we stay and settle here or there, and when we should move or evacuate to here or there, help us know where we should or should not go,<br>
let us know what we should take, and what we should leave behind and say good-bye to,<br>
let us know if there are people we should take with us, or people we should leave behind, for whatever reason,<br>
and that there would be direction, blessing and protection in all areas of our lives.<br>
This includes the people, the community, the fellowship, that we should or should not have in our lives.<br>
This includes the places that we should live in or should stay away from.<br>
This includes the things, the objects, the occupations, tasks, jobs, hobbies and activities,<br>
and other circumstances and undefined variables that<br>
should be present or absent, increased or decreased.<br>
May your will be done and may your thoughts, your plans and your purposes be carried out in us and through us.<br>
<br>
cast out fear, cast in perfect love,<br>
cast out indecisive uncertainty, cast in clarity and purpose,<br>
cast out doubt, cast in confidence in the Lord.<br>
Cast in and baptise us fully in the Holy Spirit, the Spirit that is Holy.<br>
Cast out that which would quench or limit the Holy Spirit.<br>
Give us your comfort from the comforter, the Holy Spirit.<br>
Cast in Comfort, and cast out feelings and perceptions of Loneliness and Sorrow.<br>
Unless we are supposed to feel that way, if that will guide us to where you want us to be.<br>
I would rather not be feeling weeping, mourning, Loneliness and Sorrow,<br>
but if we are to weep and mourn with those that are, then so be it, if such moments and such things work together for good.<br>
Cast in visions and dreams of what we are to do, and where we are to go, and who we should be with, according to your plans.<br>
Cast in families, fellowships and communities that will help us get closer to you, and will help us walk in obedience.<br>
Cast out families, fellowships and communities that would hinder, block or push us away from you, and in obeying your Torah.<br>
Cast out fears and imaginations of that which shall not come to pass.<br>
Unless it is your will and your plan to do otherwise, so that all things work together for good,<br>
Cast in Comfort and Peace, and cast out Sorrow and Depression<br>
Cast in Relief, and cast out Pain and Suffering<br>
Cast in Your Good Wisdom and Your Good Guidance, and cast out Deceptions, Lies, Distractions and Addictions<br>
Cast in Purpose and cast in Protection, and cast out Evil, Danger, Rebellion, selfishness, Lawlessness, and Disasters.<br>
Cast out and protect us from the worshipping of sins, selfishness, rebellion and lawlessness of others and from others.<br>
Don't allow any sins to sneak in or creep into any of us.<br>
Help us be bold and brave,<br>
Help us stay holy and set-apart, and don't let us merge, blend or mix into those and that which we should be set apart from.<br>
Keep us away and cast away from us, shield us and protect us from<br>
those that would commit crimes and sins upon me and my family.<br>
Protect us so that we do not become the victim of someone's sin, and sinful actions.<br>
Cast in Courage, and cast out Fear.<br>
Cast into us your power, your strength, your love, and give us a sound and disciplined mind.<br>
Cast in Your Peace, and cast out Turmoil<br>
Cast in Your Rest, and cast out Weariness, despair, depression and discouragement.<br>
Cast in Healing and Strength, and cast out evil, wickedness, Temptation, sin, addiction, vanity and vexation of spirit.<br>
Cast out the vanities and vexations of the world, guard us, and cast out and away from us all that you declare to be<br>
disgusting, detestable and an abomination.<br>
Cast in Carefulness, Warnings, desires and directions, and cast out Indifference and carelessness.<br>
Continue to be our good shepherd, and shepherd us toward provision, blessing, rest and safety,<br>
and shepherd us away from abuse, abusiveness, poverty, disaster, destruction, evil, sin and death.<br>
Cast in Love, compassion and Forgiveness, and cast out judging, accusations and self-opposition.<br>
Help us carefully share your Torah, your word and your Gospel in such a way that helps others believe and receive you,<br>
and help all of us and all of them get closer to you, and stay close to you, and, Yaw, help us all be more and more like you.<br>
<br>
We pray for all of this in Yaw-Who-Shaw's name, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen, Ah-Main.  Hallelujah!<br>

Darionel Serrano created a band and Bible study group, known as, Devoted To Yah.<br>
Devoted To Yah is dedicated to promoting Music and Studies on scriptural truth and its application to us today.<br>
The Devoted To Yah YouTube channel was first created in September 2011.<br>
Devoted To Yah continues to operate today (in 2020) from Browntown, New Jersey and Fort Myers, Florida, uploading video fellowship teachings and Bible studies.<br>
As of December 2020, Devoted To Yah had released about 11 different songs, mainly from 2015 to 2018.<br>
Let's take a look at the lyrics from two of his songs.<br>
<br>
One song from Devoted To Yah, is titled, Yisrael Arise.<br>
It was first uploaded to YouTube on 19 July 2017.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2017 song, Yisrael Arise, from, Devoted To Yah.<br>
<br>
<br>
They are from a foreign land to bring confusion<br>
With deception in their hands<br>
Bringing all this fancy, fake, feel-good illusions<br>
We are the ones who understand<br>
<br>
Don't be led astray by Babylon<br>
Don't you be afraid, no need to run<br>
Put the armour on because the battle is raging<br>
Don't be led astray by Babylon<br>
Don't you be afraid, no need to run<br>
Put the armour on because the battle is raging<br>
<br>
Israel arise!<br>
Come and take your stand<br>
Let me hold your hand<br>
Hearing the battle cry<br>
Israel arise!<br>
Follow the commands of<br>
The Lion and the lamb<br>
Hearing the battle cry<br>
Here in the battle cry<br>
<br>
And because we have been scattered through the nations<br>
Make every effort to demand<br>
That we gather and not dwell in isolation<br>
And be a fisher of men<br>
<br>
Look at what Yaw-Who-Wah has begun<br>
Giving you the Torah to overcome<br>
Put the armour on because the battle is raging<br>
Look at what Yaw-Who-Wah has begun<br>
Giving us the Torah to overcome<br>
Put the armour on because the battle is raging<br>
<br>
Israel arise!<br>
Come and take your stand<br>
Let me hold your hand<br>
Hearing in the battle cry<br>
Israel arise!<br>
Follow the commands<br>
Of the Lion and the lamb<br>
Here in the battle cry<br>
Hearing in the battle cry<br>
<br>
Don't delay<br>
Sound the shofar because Yaw-Who-Shaw is on His way<br>
Salvation will come, no matter what the wicked say<br>
We will enter the promised land on that glorious day<br>
Sin and death will be destroyed<br>
And everything will be OK<br>
<br>
Israel arise!<br>
Come and take your stand<br>
Let me hold your hand<br>
Here in the battle cry<br>
Israel arise!<br>
Follow the commands<br>
Of the Lion and the lamb<br>
Hearing in the battle cry<br>
Israel arise!<br>
Come and take your stand<br>
Let me hold your hand<br>
Here in the battle cry<br>
Israel arise!<br>
Follow the commands of<br>
The Lion and the lamb<br>
Hearing the battle cry<br>
Hearing the battle cry<br>
Here in the battle cry<br>
Here in the battle cry<br>
Here in the battle cry<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The second song we will be taking a look at, is titled, How Long, also from, Devoted To Yah.<br>
<br>
The first raw recording of How Long, was uploaded to YouTube on 25 October 2015.<br>
<br>
In the lyrics of this next song that we will be looking at,<br>
what we would say in English as,<br>
Jesus our Messiah, the Spirit of the Lord,<br>
will be sung in the next song in Hebrew as<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw our Muh-Shee-Uck, Roo-Awk Ah-Doe-Nye.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw is the Hebrew name of Jesus Christ.<br>
We would pronounce it in English as, Joshua.<br>
But, since the J makes a Yuh sound in Hebrew, it is actually pronounced in Hebrew as, Yaw-Who-Shaw.<br>
Muh-Shee-Uck is the Hebrew way of pronouncing what became the English word, Messiah.<br>
A Messiah is an anointed king who comes to rescue, deliver and save his people.<br>
Jesus Christ is our Messiah, our saviour, our anointed king who saves us from sin and death.<br>
<br>
Ah-Doe-Nye is a Hebrew word that means, the Lord.<br>
Ah-Doe-Nye refers to the Lord, God, Yaw-Who-Wah, as a title of Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
Roo-Awk is Spirit, breath.<br>
Knowing this, we can now understand that,<br>
the Hebrew verse in the song,<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw our Muh-Shee-Uck, Roo-Awk Ah-Doe-Nye<br>
would be translated into English as<br>
Jesus our Messiah, the Spirit of the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2015 song, How Long, from, Devoted To Yah.<br>
<br>
<br>
How long will it be 'til we see the coming of the son of man?<br>
How long will it be 'til Yaw comes to destroy the wicked man<br>
How long will it be 'til Babylon is taken from our land<br>
At the end of this age and we come to this stage when he judges with his hand<br>
<br>
Oh, we gotta move on<br>
We've got to press on<br>
For the prize<br>
Of our lives<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw our Muh-Shee-Uck, Roo-Awk Ah-Doe-Nye<br>
I put on the full armour so I can put up a fight<br>
<br>
Most people go along with some people who are wrong<br>
But I'm singing this song, waiting for the break of dawn<br>
No I won't go back to who I used to be<br>
I stay in harmony with the one who set me free<br>
I'm a debtor to mercy<br>
Hungry and thirsty<br>
Ready for your kingdom come<br>
I'm hoping on firmly<br>
I know that you're worthy<br>
Father let your will be done<br>
Shatter Babylonian mentality <br>
We prepare our people for a state of emergency<br>
<br>
How long will it be 'til we see the coming of the son of man?<br>
How long will it be 'til Yaw comes to destroy the wicked man<br>
How long will it be 'til Babylon is taken from our land<br>
At the end of this age and we come to this stage when he judges with his hand<br>
<br>
Oh, we gotta move on<br>
We've got to press on<br>
For the prize<br>
Of our lives<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw our Muh-Shee-Uck, Roo-Awk Ah-Doe-Nye<br>
I put on the full armour so I can put up a fight<br>
<br>
Then people mend<br>
Pretend to be my friend<br>
But I refuse to bend, and bow down to them again<br>
No I won't go back to who I used to be<br>
I stay passionately<br>
No more chains are holding me<br>
We must hold on<br>
We must stay strong<br>
Endure the pain from Babylon<br>
Knowing she will<br>
receive the judgement from the Lion<br>
We're holding on<br>
We're calling on<br>
The King of New Jerusalem<br>
It won't be long<br>
We will be marching into Zion<br>
<br>
How long will it be 'til we see the coming of the son of man?<br>
How long will it be 'til Yaw comes to destroy the wicked man<br>
How long will it be 'til Babylon is taken from our land<br>
At the end of this age and we come to this stage when he judges with his hand<br>
<br>
Oh, we gotta move on<br>
We've got to press on<br>
For the prize<br>
Of our lives<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw our Muh-Shee-Uck, Roo-Awk Ah-Doe-Nye<br>
I put on the full armour so I can put up a fight<br>
<br>
Oh, we gotta move on<br>
We've got to press on<br>
For the prize<br>
Of our lives<br>
Yaw-Who-Shaw our Muh-Shee-Uck, Roo-Awk Ah-Doe-Nye<br>
I put on the full armour so I can put up a fight<br>
<br>
How long will we wait<br>
Until we see his beautiful face<br>
How long must we fight<br>
No more cries in the middle of the night<br>
<br>
How long will we wait<br>
Until we see his beautiful face<br>
How long must we fight<br>
No more cries in the middle of the night<br>

Here is an important review and reminder of some verses mentioned previously.<br>
Most of these verses were looked at in Christian Essays 1, 3, and 10.<br>
Which is, the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapters 1, 3, and 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 10:9 KJV<br>
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br>
<br>

If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 11: 19 & 20 KJV<br>
19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:<br>
20 That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 11: 19 & 20 NLT<br>
19 And I will give them singleness of heart and put a new spirit within them. I will take away their stony, stubborn heart and give them a tender, responsive heart, (a heart of flesh)<br>
20 so they will obey my decrees and regulations. Then they will truly be my people, and I will be their God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 36:25-27 KJV<br>
25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.<br>
26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.<br>

27 And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Zechariah 4:6 (KJV)<br>
...Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.<br>
<br>
Zechariah 4:6 (NLT)<br>
...It is not by force nor by strength, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of Heaven's Armies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14: 15-24 KJV<br>
15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.<br>
16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;<br>
17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.<br>
18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.<br>
19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.<br>
20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<br>
21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.<br>
22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?<br>
23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.<br>
24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.<br>
<br>
<br>
John 14: 15-24 NLT<br>
15 "If you love me, obey my commandments.<br>
(If you love me, you will obey my commandments.)<br>
(If you love me, you should obey my commandments.)<br>
<br>
16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, who will never leave you.<br>
(And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, Encourager, Counsellor, Paraclete who will never leave you.)<br>
<br>
17 He is the Holy Spirit, who leads into all truth. The world cannot receive him, because it isn't looking for him and doesn't recognise him. But you know him, because he lives with you now and later will be in you (and is in you).<br>
18 No, I will not abandon you as orphans -- I will come to you.<br>
19 Soon the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Since I live, you also will live.<br>
20 When I am raised to life again, you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.<br>
21 Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them."<br>
22 Judas (not Judas Iscariot, but the other disciple with that name) said to him, "Lord, why are you going to reveal yourself only to us and not to the world at large?"<br>
23 Jesus replied, "All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.<br>
24 Anyone who doesn't love me will not obey me. And remember, my words are not my own. What I am telling you is from the Father who sent me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Proverbs 28:9 -- The Scriptures 2009 translation (TS2009) (1993, 2009, 2015)<br>

<br>
Back when we were in<br>
Christian Essays 15<br>
The Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 15,<br>
we did a Bible study about the<br>
Birth of Jesus<br>
and then we looked at the words of a well-known Christmas carol<br>
O Holy Night (O Night Divine).<br>
<br>
We will once again consult the pages within Wikipedia,<br>
the free encyclopaedia, to look at<br>
another well-known English Christmas carol,<br>
that first appeared in 1739.<br>
<br>
The original, slower version, was titled,<br>
Hymn for Christmas-Day, by Charles Wesley, in 1739.<br>
Then, after a few changes to the words and melody,<br>
it eventually became,<br>
Hark! The Herald Angels Sing<br>
with an English Adaptation by George Whitefield in 1758.<br>
<br>
Then, an official UK publication, titled,<br>
Carols for Choirs, that was published in 1961,<br>
had also made a few slight changes that make it into<br>
the familiar carol that is well-known today.<br>
<br>
Carols for Choirs is a collection of choral scores,<br>
predominantly of Christmas carols and hymns,<br>
first published in 1961 by Oxford University Press.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, has been used in dozens and dozens<br>
of movies and TV shows.<br>
<br>

Let's look at the words to this song that became, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the first version, when you encounter the line that says,<br>
<br>
HARK how all the Welkin rings<br>
"Glory to the King of Kings,<br>
<br>
That would mean,<br>
Listen to how all the clouds ring, Glory to the King of Kings.<br>
<br>
Welkin is an old English word that means, clouds.<br>
To make the welkin ring, means,<br>
to make the clouds ring,<br>
to make a noise so great that it makes the clouds ring,<br>
To make a loud noise, to celebrate, to make merry.<br>
<br>
Here are all the lyrics to all three editions,<br>
of, the song, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing<br>
all placed here together.<br>
We start with, the slower, first edition,<br>
Hymn for Christmas-Day<br>
by Charles Wesley in 1739.<br>
and then we go into the English Adaptation<br>
by George Whitefield that came out in 1758,<br>
and finally finishing with the edition published in,<br>
Carols for Choirs, in 1961.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HARK how all the Welkin rings<br>
"Glory to the King of Kings,<br>
"Peace on Earth, and Mercy mild,<br>
"GOD and Sinners reconcil'd!<br>
<br>
Joyful all ye Nations rise,<br>

There in the battle we're lifting Your name<br>
Standing together forever we're marching on<br>

<br>
Though darkness surrounds there's hope in our eyes<br>
For You are our victory our joy and our prize<br>
Standing together forever we're marching on<br>

We are believers, all our hope in the risen one<br>
And we are soldiers, fighting with faith and love<br>
And we are pilgrims, on a journey to reach our home<br>
Standing together we are the children of God<br>
<br>

Nothing can stop us for You're on our side<br>
Even in dying our souls are alive<br>
Standing together forever we're marching on<br>

We are believers,<br>
all our hope in the risen one<br>
And we are soldiers,<br>
we're fighting with faith and love<br>
And we are pilgrims, on a journey to reach our home<br>

The book of Ecclesiasticus Sirach is not in the Bible anymore.<br>
It used to be in the KJV when it was first released.<br>
The book of Ecclesiasticus Sirach is a Jewish work originally in Hebrew of ethical teachings, from approximately 200 to 175 BC, written by the Jewish scribe Ben Sira of Jerusalem, on the inspiration of his father Joshua son of Sirach, sometimes called Jesus son of Sirach or Yeshua ben Eliezer ben Sira.<br>
In Egypt, it was translated into Greek by the author's unnamed grandson, who added a prologue.<br>
In the prologue, the author's unnamed grandson mentions his grandfather Jesus, which would be his grandfather, Joshua son of Sirach, sometimes called Jesus son of Sirach or Yeshua ben Eliezer ben Sira.<br>
This prologue is generally considered the earliest witness to a canon of the books of the prophets, and thus the date of the text is the subject of intense scrutiny.<br>
Here is a sample from Chapter 2 of this book of Ecclesiasticus Sirach.<br>
<br>
Ecclesiasticus Sirach 2: 1-6 (KJVAAE)<br>
King James Version with Apocrypha, American Edition (KJVA)<br>
(1611, 1962, 2010)<br>
<br>
1 My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for temptation.<br>
2 Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble.<br>
3 Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end.<br>
4 Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low estate.<br>
5 For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity.<br>
6 Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright, and trust in him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiasticus Sirach 2: 1-6  (RV1895)<br>
Authorised Revision of KJV -- Revised Version with Apocrypha 1895 (RV1895) (1895)<br>
1<br>
My son, if thou comest to serve the Lord,<br>
Prepare thy soul for temptation.<br>
2<br>
Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure,<br>
And make not haste in time of calamity.<br>
3<br>
Cleave unto him, and depart not,<br>
That thou mayest be increased at thy latter end.<br>
4<br>
Accept whatsoever is brought upon thee,<br>
And be longsuffering when thou passest into humiliation.<br>
5<br>
For gold is tried in the fire,<br>
And acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.<br>
6<br>
Put thy trust in him, and he will help thee:<br>
Order thy ways aright, and set thy hope on him.<br>

Ecclesiasticus Sirach 2: 1-6<br>
Revised Standard Version 1977 with Apocrypha<br>
YOUVERSION BIBLE.COM WEBSITE HAS WRONG TRANSLATION TITLE AND WRONG ACRONYM IDENTIFICATION<br>
1<br>
My son, if you come forward to serve the Lord,<br>
prepare yourself for (trials and) temptation.<br>
2<br>
Set your heart right and be steadfast,<br>
and do not be hasty in time of calamity.<br>
3<br>
Cleave to him and do not depart,<br>
that you may be honoured at the end of your life.<br>
4<br>
Accept whatever is brought upon you,<br>
and in changes that humble you be patient.<br>
5<br>
For gold is tested in the fire,<br>
and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.<br>
6<br>
Trust in him, and he will help you;<br>
make your ways straight, and hope in him.<br>
