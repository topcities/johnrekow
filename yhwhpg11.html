Isaiah 35: 2-6 KJV<br>
...see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.<br>
<br>
3 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.<br>
<br>
(Say to them that are of a hasty heart,)<br>
4 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompense; he will come and save you.<br>
5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.<br>
6 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 35: 2-6 NLT<br>
...the Lord will display his glory,<br>
the splendour of our God.<br>
3<br>
With this news, strengthen those who have tired hands,<br>
and encourage those who have weak knees.<br>
4<br>
Say to those with fearful hearts,<br>
"Be strong, and do not fear,<br>
for your God is coming to destroy your enemies.<br>
He is coming to save you."<br>
5<br>
And when he comes, he will open the eyes of the blind<br>
and unplug the ears of the deaf.<br>
6<br>
The lame will leap like a deer,<br>
and those who cannot speak will sing for joy!<br>

Revelation 4:6 (KJV)<br>
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.<br>
<br>
<br>
Revelation 15:2 (KJV)<br>
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.<br>

<br>
This band originally started in 1996 as a band called, Chin Up.<br>
Their name was changed to, Switchfoot, which refers to the act of changing direction whilst surfing, by switching your feet.<br>
Switchfoot is an American rock band from San Diego, California.<br>
Some of their songs contain subtle amounts of Christian Rock content.<br>
As of July 2019, they have released 11 regular studio albums.<br>
That number does not include the 4 Live albums, the 3 Compilation albums nor the 5 Video albums that were also around at that time.<br>
<br>
From their eighth studio album, Vice Verses, I would like to share with you the lyrics to the song, Restless.<br>
A shorter, Radio Edited version was released as a single in July of 2011,<br>
Then the album, with its longer, album version, was released on 27 September 2011.<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2011 song, Restless, by Switchfoot.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am the sea on a moonless night,<br>
Calling, falling, slipping tides<br>
I am the leaky, dripping pipes<br>
The endless aching drops of light<br>
I am the raindrop falling down,<br>
Always longing for the deeper ground<br>
I am the broken, breaking seas<br>
Even my blood finds ways to bleed<br>
<br>
Even the rivers ways to run<br>
Even the rain to reach the sun<br>
Even my thirsty streams,<br>
Even in my dreams<br>
<br>
I am restless, I am restless<br>
I am restless, looking for you<br>
I am restless, I run like the ocean to find your shore<br>
Looking for you<br>
<br>
I am the thorn stuck in your side,<br>
I am the one that you left behind,<br>
I am the dried up doubting eyes<br>
Looking for the well that won't run dry<br>
<br>
Running hard for the other side<br>
The world that I've always been denied<br>
Running hard for the infinite<br>
With the tears of the saints and hypocrites<br>
<br>
Oh blood of black and white and grey<br>
Death and life and night and day<br>
One by one by one<br>
We let our rivers run<br>
<br>
I am restless, I am restless<br>
I am restless, looking for you<br>
I am restless, I run like the ocean to find your shore<br>
Looking for you<br>
<br>
I can hear you breathing,<br>
I can hear you leading<br>
More than just a feeling<br>
More than just a feeling<br>
I can feel you reaching<br>
Pushing through the ceiling<br>
'til the final healing<br>
I'm looking for you<br>
<br>
Until the sea of glass we meet<br>
At last completed and complete<br>
Where tide of tear and pain subside<br>
Laughter drinks them dry<br>
<br>
I'll be waiting<br>
Anticipating<br>
All that I aim for<br>
What I was made for<br>
With every heartbeat<br>
All of my blood bleeds<br>
Running inside me<br>
Looking for you<br>
Looking for you<br>
<br>
I am restless, I am restless<br>
I am restless, looking for you<br>
I am restless, I run like the ocean to find your shore<br>
I'm looking for you<br>
<br>
I can feel you breathing<br>
I can feel you leading<br>
More than just a feeling<br>
More than just a feeling<br>
I can feel you reaching<br>
Pushing through the ceiling<br>
'til the final healing<br>
I'm looking for you<br>
I'm looking for you<br>
<br>
<br>
Consider the thoughts and ideas from Switchfoot's song, Restless, as we take a look here, next, at the words to another song, here, in just a moment.<br>

Commentary:<br>
The book of Psalms is a collection of songs that were written throughout many centuries.<br>
The Psalms could have been written at least 650 years before Jesus Christ was born.<br>
Some of the Psalms could have been written even as long ago as 1500 years before Jesus Christ was born.<br>
With that in mind, Psalms 107 told what Jesus Christ was going to do, many, many centuries before He was even born.<br>
Let's read this prophecy here in the Old Testament, and then see it come true in the New Testament.<br>
There are many, many other prophecies about Jesus in the Old Testament that became true in the New Testament.<br>
We saw a big collection of them in Isaiah chapters 52 and 53, in Christian Essays 8.<br>
Here is yet one more prophecy about Jesus Christ...<br>
<br>
Psalms 107: 28 & 29 KJV<br>
28 Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.<br>
29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 107: 28 & 29 NLT<br>
28<br>
"Lord, help!" they cried in their trouble,<br>
and he saved them from their distress.<br>
29<br>
He calmed the storm to a whisper<br>
and stilled the waves.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 8: 24-27 -- KJV<br>
24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.<br>
25 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.<br>
26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.<br>
27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 8: 24-27 -- NLT<br>
24 Suddenly, a fierce storm struck the lake, with waves breaking into the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.<br>
25 The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!"<br>
26 Jesus responded, "Why are you afraid? You have so little faith!" Then he got up and rebuked the wind and waves, and suddenly there was a great calm.<br>
27 The disciples were amazed. "Who is this man?" they asked. "Even the winds and waves obey him!"<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4: 37-41 -- KJV<br>
37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.<br>
38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?<br>
39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.<br>
40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?<br>
41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?<br>
<br>
<br>
Mark 4: 37-41 NLT<br>
37 But soon a fierce storm came up. High waves were breaking into the boat, and it began to fill with water.<br>
38 Jesus was sleeping at the back of the boat with his head on a cushion. The disciples woke him up, shouting, "Teacher, don't you care that we're going to drown?"<br>
39 When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Silence! Be still!" Suddenly the wind stopped, and there was a great calm.<br>
40 Then he asked them, "Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?"<br>
41 The disciples were absolutely terrified. "Who is this man?" they asked each other. "Even the wind and waves obey him!"<br>

Psalms 119: 49-55 KJV<br>
49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.<br>
50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.<br>
51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.<br>
52 I remembered thy judgements of old, O Lord; and have comforted myself.<br>
53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.<br>
54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.<br>
55 I have remembered thy name, O Lord, in the night....<br>

it comforts me in all my troubles.<br>
51<br>
The proud hold me in utter contempt,<br>
but I do not turn away from your instructions.<br>
52<br>
I meditate on your age-old regulations;<br>
O Lord, they comfort me.<br>
53<br>
I become furious with the wicked,<br>
because they reject your instructions.<br>

Your decrees have been the theme of my songs<br>
wherever I have lived.<br>

I reflect at night on who you are, O Lord....<br>

"I have heard your prayer and have chosen this Temple as the place for making sacrifices.<br>
13 At times I might shut up the heavens so that no rain falls, or command grasshoppers to devour your crops, or send plagues amongst you.<br>
14 Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land.<br>

<br>
Where will you run, my soul<br>
Where will you go when wells run dry<br>
When the wind starts to blow<br>
How you gonna keep this flame alive<br>
<br>
In the fading light when night is breaking<br>
I know You will always be waiting<br>
You'll always be there<br>
<br>
I'm running to the secret place<br>
Where You are, where You are<br>
I sing to You of all the ways<br>
You stole my heart, stole my heart<br>
Better is a moment that I spend with You<br>
Than a million other days away<br>
I'm running, I'm running<br>
I'm running to the secret place<br>
<br>
You are my only hope,<br>
You are the Rock on which I stand.<br>
You will not let me go<br>
I know that I`m safe inside Your hands.<br>
<br>
Hands are lifted high, hearts awake to life<br>
We are satisfied here with You, here with You<br>
Chains will hit the floor, broken lives restored<br>
We couldn't ask for more here with You, here with You<br>
<br>

Commentary:<br>
Have you ever heard anyone say this:<br>
To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.<br>
<br>
That sure sounds nice, but that saying is not in the Bible.<br>
<br>
Here is something that sounds similar, but, again, the Bible does not say<br>
that, To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.<br>
<br>
The kind-of similar sentence is in 2 Corinthians 5:8.<br>
We will read that verse here, in just a moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 4:13 through chapter 5, verse 1, then we skip down to chapter 5, verses 6, 7 and 8 -- KJV<br>
13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;<br>
14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.<br>
15 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.<br>
16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.<br>
17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;<br>
18 Whilst we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.<br>
1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.<br>
<br>
6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:<br>
7 For we walk by faith, not by sight:<br>
8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 4:13, reading all the way to chapter 5, verse 1, then skipping down to chapter 5, verses 6, 7, and 8 -- NLT<br>
13 But we continue to preach because we have the same kind of faith the psalmist had when he said, "I believed in God, so I spoke." -- (quoting from Psalms 116:10)<br>
14 We know that God, who raised the Lord Jesus, will also raise us with Jesus and present us to himself together with you.<br>
15 All of this is for your benefit. And as God's grace reaches more and more people, there will be great thanksgiving, and God will receive more and more glory.<br>
16 That is why we never give up. Though our bodies are dying, our spirits are being renewed every day.<br>
(We never give up. Though our bodies are dying, our inner being is being renewed every day.)<br>
<br>
17 For our present troubles are small and won't last very long. Yet they produce for us a glory that vastly outweighs them and will last forever!<br>
18 So we don't look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen. For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever.<br>
1 For we know that when this earthly tent we live in is taken down (that is, when we die and leave this earthly body), we will have a house in heaven, an eternal body made for us by God himself and not by human hands.<br>
<br>
6 So we are always confident, even though we know that as long as we live in these bodies we are not at home with the Lord.<br>
7 For we live by believing and not by seeing.<br>
8 Yes, we are fully confident, and we would rather be away from these earthly bodies, for then we will be at home with the Lord.<br>
<br>

Open my eyes to see<br>
the wonderful truths in your instructions.<br>
<br>

18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.<br>
(Reveal thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.)<br>
<br>
Part of 1 John 3:1 KJV<br>
1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 2:27 through 1 John 3:3 KJV<br>
27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.<br>
28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.<br>
29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.<br>
1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.<br>
2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<br>
3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 2:26 through 1 John 3:3 NLT<br>
26 I am writing these things to warn you about those who want to lead you astray.<br>
27 But you have received the Holy Spirit, (you have received the anointing from him,) and he lives within you, so you don't need anyone to teach you what is true.<br>
For the Spirit teaches you everything you need to know, and what he teaches is true -- it is not a lie. So just as he has taught you, remain in fellowship with Christ.<br>
(For the anointing teaches you everything you need to know, and what he teaches is true -- it is not a lie. So just as he has taught you, remain in fellowship with Christ.)<br>
<br>
28 And now, dear children, remain in fellowship with Christ so that when he returns, you will be full of courage and not shrink back from him in shame.<br>
29 Since we know that Christ is righteous, we also know that all who do what is right are God's children.<br>
1 See how very much our Father loves us, for he calls us his children, and that is what we are! But the people who belong to this world don't recognise that we are God's children because they don't know him.<br>
2 Dear friends, we are already God's children, but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears. But we do know that we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is.<br>
3 And all who have this eager expectation will keep themselves pure, just as he is pure.<br>
<br>
<br>
We recently read this next section of Scripture before.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 3: 4-7 KJV<br>
...the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,<br>
5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;<br>
6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;<br>
7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<br>
<br>
Titus 3: 4-7 NLT<br>
...when God our Saviour revealed his kindness and love,<br>
5 he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
(He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.)<br>
<br>
6 He generously poured out the Spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Saviour.<br>
7 Because of his grace he made us right in his sight and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 4: 13-17 KJV<br>
13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.<br>
14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.<br>
15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.<br>
16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<br>
17 Herein is our love made perfect....<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 4: 13-17 NLT<br>
13 And God has given us his Spirit as proof that we live in him and he in us.<br>
14 Furthermore, we have seen with our own eyes and now testify that the Father sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.<br>
15 All who declare that Jesus is the Son of God have God living in them, and they live in God.<br>
16<br>
We know how much God loves us, and we have put our trust in his love.<br>
God is love, and all who live in love live in God, and God lives in them.<br>
17 And as we live in God, our love grows more perfect....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 16:27 KJV<br>
27 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.<br>
<br>
John 16:27 NLT<br>
(for the Father himself loves you dearly because you love me and believe that I came from the Father.)<br>
27 for the Father himself loves you dearly because you love me and believe that I came from God.<br>
<br>
Psalms 13:5 KJV<br>
5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.<br>
<br>
Psalms 13:5 NLT<br>
But I trust in your unfailing love.<br>
I will rejoice because you have rescued me.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zephaniah 3: 15-18 KJV<br>
...the king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.<br>
16 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.<br>
(Let not thine hands be faint.)<br>
17 The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; (he will be silent in his love,) he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.<br>
18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.<br>
(to whom the burden upon it was reproach.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Zephaniah 3: 15-18 NLT<br>
...the Lord himself, the King of Israel,<br>
will live amongst you!<br>
At last your troubles will be over,<br>
and you will never again fear disaster.<br>
16 On that day the announcement to Jerusalem will be,<br>
"Cheer up, Zion! Don't be afraid!<br>
17 For the Lord your God is living amongst you.<br>
He is a mighty saviour.<br>
He will take delight in you with gladness.<br>
With his love, he will calm all your fears.<br>
He will rejoice over you with joyful songs."<br>
<br>
(With his love, He will be silent in his love. He will renew you with his love. He will rejoice over you with joyful songs.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
18 "I will gather you who mourn for the appointed festivals;<br>
you will be disgraced no more.<br>
<br>
(The meaning of the Hebrew in verse 18 is uncertain.)<br>
<br>
Commentary: Verse 18 may most likely be referring to Feast 6 of 7, The Day of Atonement, nine days after the Festival of Trumpets,<br>
which occurred in September or October.<br>
It is celebrated today as Yom Kippur.<br>
The affliction most likely is due to those who choose to fast on this day of a solemn assembly.<br>
<br>
Zephaniah 3: 18 & 19 GNV<br>
18 After a certain time will I gather the afflicted that were of thee, and them that bare the reproch for it.<br>
19 Behold, at that time I will bruise all that afflict thee, and I will save her that halteth, (I will save the weak, lame and helpless) and gather her that was cast out, and I will get them praise and fame in all the lands of their shame.<br>

2 Thessalonians 2:3 -- KJV<br>
3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;<br>
<br>
Commentary: Those that argue for the mid-trib or post-trib rapture perspective have turned to this verse for the support of that mid-trib or post-trib rapture argument.<br>
2 Thessalonians 2:3 KJV says that "there come a falling away first".<br>
That sounds like the tribulation has to start before the rapture can happen.<br>
<br>
However, look what happens to this same verse in the Geneva Bible.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Thessalonians 2:3 -- Geneva Bible (GNV) (published in the year 1560)<br>
Published 51 years before the King James Version.<br>
3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a departing first, and that that man of sin be disclosed, even the son of perdition,<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
In the Geneva Bible, it says, "that day (the start of the tribulation) shall not come, except there come a departing first...."<br>
A departing would support a pre-trib argument.<br>
If the great departure of Christians needs to happen first, the sudden rapture of the church, needs to happen first, then this verse would indicate a pre-trib rapture, here in the Geneva Bible (GNV).<br>
The 1560 Geneva Bible may be indicating that the rapture needs to happen before the Tribulation can begin.<br>

1 Corinthians 7:18 & 19 KJV<br>
18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.<br>
19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing....<br>
<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 7:18 & 19 NLT<br>
...a man who was circumcised before he became a believer should not try to reverse it. And the man who was uncircumcised when he became a believer should not be circumcised now.<br>
19 For it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV<br>
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2:8-9 NLT<br>
8 God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can't take credit for this; it is a gift from God. <br>
9 Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 2:23, going into chapter 3, to verse 10 -- KJV<br>
<br>
23 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?<br>
24 For the name of God is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles through you, as it is written.<br>
25 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.<br>
26 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?<br>
27 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?<br>
28 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:<br>
29 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.<br>
1 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?<br>
2 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.<br>
3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?<br>
4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.<br>
5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)<br>
6 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?<br>
7 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?<br>
8 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.<br>
9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;<br>
10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There is none righteous, no, not one -- Romans 3:10 (KJV)<br>
<br>
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God -- Romans 3:23 (KJV)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 2: starting in verse 23, continuing into chapter 3, going to verse 10, NLT.<br>
NLT<br>
23 You are so proud of knowing the law, but you dishonour God by breaking it.<br>
24 No wonder the Scriptures say, "The Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you."<br>
(Verse 24 right there is quoting from the Greek version of Isaiah 52:5.)<br>
<br>
25 The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God's law. But if you don't obey God's law, you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile.<br>
26 And if the Gentiles obey God's law, won't God declare them to be his own people?<br>
27 In fact, uncircumcised Gentiles who keep God's law will condemn you Jews who are circumcised and possess God's law but don't obey it.<br>
28 For you are not a true Jew just because you were born of Jewish parents or because you have gone through the ceremony of circumcision.<br>
29 No, a true Jew is one whose heart is right with God. And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law; rather, it is a change of heart produced by the Spirit. And a person with a changed heart seeks praise (and receives praise) from God, not from people.<br>
1 Then what's the advantage of being a Jew? Is there any value in the ceremony of circumcision? <br>
<br>
<br>
2 Yes, there are great benefits! First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the whole revelation of God.<br>
(The Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.)<br>
3 True, some of them were unfaithful; but just because they were unfaithful, does that mean God will be unfaithful?<br>
4 Of course not! Even if everyone else is a liar, God is true. As the Scriptures say about him,<br>
"You will be proved right in what you say,<br>
and you will win your case in court."<br>
(That is a quote from the Greek version of Psalms 51:4.)<br>
<br>
5 "But," some might say, "our sinfulness serves a good purpose, for it helps people see how righteous God is. Isn't it unfair, then, for him to punish us?" (This is merely a human point of view.)<br>
6 Of course not! If God were not entirely fair, how would he be qualified to judge the world?<br>
7 "But," someone might still argue, "how can God condemn me as a sinner if my dishonesty highlights his truthfulness and brings him more glory?"<br>
8 And some people even slander us by claiming that we say, "The more we sin, the better it is!" Those who say such things deserve to be condemned.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 Well then, should we conclude that we Jews are better than others? No, not at all, for we have already shown that all people, whether Jews or Gentiles, (whether Jews or Greeks,) are under the power of sin.<br>
10<br>
As the Scriptures say,<br>
"No one is righteous -- <br>
not even one.<br>
<br>
There in verse 10, Paul is quoting that from<br>
Psalms 14:1-3 (Greek version)<br>
which is also found and repeated in<br>
Psalms 53:1-3 (Greek version)<br>
<br>
We stop reading here at verse 10, but if we were to keep on reading this chapter,<br>
we would have heard Paul also quote from<br>
Psalms 5:9 (Greek version),<br>
Psalms 140:3 (Hebrew version),<br>
Psalms 10:7 (Greek version),<br>
Isaiah 59:7-8,<br>
and Psalms 36:1.<br>
Those are the other verses that Paul quoted here in this area of Romans chapter 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 1-6 KJV<br>
1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.<br>
2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.<br>
3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.<br>
4 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.<br>
5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.<br>
6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 5: 1-6 NLT<br>
1 So Christ has truly set us free. Now make sure that you stay free, and don't get tied up again in slavery to the law.<br>
2 Listen! I, Paul, tell you this: If you are counting on circumcision to make you right with God, then Christ will be of no benefit to you.<br>
3 I'll say it again. If you are trying to find favour with God by being circumcised, you must obey every regulation in the whole law of Moses.<br>
4 For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law, you have been cut off from Christ! You have fallen away from God's grace.<br>
5 But we who live by the Spirit eagerly wait to receive by faith the righteousness God has promised to us.<br>
6 For when we place our faith in Christ Jesus, there is no benefit in being circumcised or being uncircumcised. What is important is faith expressing itself in love.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 10: 15, then verses 43-45 KJV<br>
15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.<br>
<br>
43 ...through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.<br>
44 Whilst Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.<br>
45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<br>
<br>
Acts 10: 15, then verses 43-46 NLT<br>
15 But the voice spoke again: "Do not call something unclean if God has made it clean."<br>
<br>
43 He is the one all the prophets testified about, saying that everyone who believes in him will have their sins forgiven through his name."<br>
44 Even as Peter was saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the message.<br>
45 The Jewish believers (The faithful ones of the circumcision,) who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles, too.<br>
46 For they heard them speaking in other tongues (in other languages) and praising God.<br>
<br>
Commentary:<br>
The Jewish believers were known as those of the circumcision.<br>
The Gentiles were the non-Jews, the various nations around the world.<br>
The Gentiles are the many nations around the world, and they were also known as the un-circumcised.<br>
So, if the Gentiles are the un-circumcised, then, we can look at parts of verses 43 through 46 like this:<br>
Everyone who believes in him will have their sins forgiven through his name.<br>
The Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the message.<br>
The gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the un-circumcised, too.<br>
How do we know that this happened to the un-circumcised?<br>
They heard them speaking in other tongues (in other languages) and praising God.<br>
<br>
<br>
In summary, an uncircumcised man does not need to be circumcised to be saved and then get the gift of the Holy Spirit. However, after that, since the goal must be to obey the Bible after receiving salvation, then, eventually that man would need to get physically circumcised in order to obey the commandment to keep the Passover, which is what we saw when we did the Bible study, titled, Passover, when we were in Christian Essays 9, the Bible's Greatest Hits, Chapter 9.<br>

the seventh day of the week, dedicated by the Romans to Saturn.<br>
the Jewish Sabbath.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: People say that Jesus died when he was 33 years old.<br>
Where is that found in the Bible? It is not in the Bible.<br>
That information is not in the Bible. We are not really sure how old he was when he died.<br>
Why 33?  The Free Masons like that number 33.<br>
Do you think they had something to do with that idea?<br>
If you study it carefully, the Bible does tell us how old he was when he died.<br>
He was infinity years old!<br>

Isaiah 6 -- all of chapter 6 -- KJV<br>
In order to present additional Hebrew meanings, many of the verses are repeated, to help present these additional or alternate Hebrew meanings, and they are also enclosed in round brackets.<br>
<br>
1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.<br>
(In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and the skirts thereof filled the temple.)<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.<br>
<br>
<br>
3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.<br>
(And this cried to this, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: his glory is the fulness of the whole earth.)<br>
<br>
<br>
4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.<br>
(And the posts of the thresholds moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.)<br>
<br>
<br>
5 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.<br>
(Then said I, Woe is me! for I am cut off; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:<br>
(Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, and in his hand a live coal, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.<br>
(And he caused it to touch my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.<br>
(Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, behold me; send me.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
9 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.<br>

13 But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.<br>
(But yet in it shall be a tenth, when it is returned, and hath been broused, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose stock, or, stem is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: The KJV of verse 13 sounds like a tree when the leaves fall off of the tree, just before the start of winter.<br>
Even though the tree looks dead, having no leaves on it, it comes back to life in the springtime, in the appointed season.<br>
In the NLT, verse 13, which we will read here in a moment, talks about trees after they are cut down, and all that is left is the tree stump.<br>
There are many kinds of trees that, after you cut them down, and you leave only a dead-looking tree stump,<br>
a few weeks or months later, all of the sudden, a new, little tree starts to grow up again, out of the big, old tree stump.<br>
You think that the tree stump is all dead, but it is still well rooted, and so it starts to grow a new tree all over again out of the well-rooted tree stump!<br>
The remnant that is left may appear to be dead or invisible or insignificant, but it is still very much alive, and will grow and will become strong and mighty again, only if it is well-rooted, and deeply-rooted in the Word of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: looking at the word, broused,<br>
The Strong's Hebrew Lexicon and<br>
Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions include the following...<br>
kindle,<br>
consume (by fire or by eating);<br>
to be (or to become) brutish:--be brutish,<br>
bring (put, take) away, burn,<br>
(cause to) eat (up),<br>
feed, heat, kindle, set on fire, waste.<br>
to burn,<br>
consume,<br>
kindle, be kindled<br>
begin to burn, be kindled, start burning<br>
to burn, be burning, consume<br>
God's wrath, human wrath<br>
to consume, remove (of guilt)<br>
to kindle<br>
to burn up<br>
to consume (destroy)<br>
to be stupid, brutish, barbarous<br>
to be stupid, dull-hearted, unreceptive<br>
to feed, graze<br>
to cause to be grazed over<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: Interesting. The same word for, stupid, is also the same word that means, to burn up or destroy.<br>
When your conscience gets burned up, you become stupid and callous.<br>
<br>
We focused on this back in Christian Essays 3, about half way down into that chapter.<br>
We talked about how there are many examples where the Old Testament gives the commandment, and then the New Testament takes it to a higher, more in-depth level of an explanation as to why it is harmful and destructive to not obey that commandment.<br>
<br>
And then we read a bit of 1 Timothy 4. Remember what it said there in 1 Timothy 4:2...<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 4:2 (KJV)<br>
speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;<br>
<br>
To sear is to burn something with a sudden powerful heat,<br>
To sear is to scorch, to dry out or wither, to make someone callous or unfeeling.<br>
And then we went into further detail in that study back in Christian Essays 3.<br>
<br>
Interesting how 1 Timothy 4:2 and this word, broused, found here in Isaiah 6, have some kind of connection between burning up and becoming stupid.<br>
But even a burned up tree or a cut down tree stump can sometimes come back to life and grow up again. Talk about getting beauty out of ashes!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Isaiah 6 -- all of chapter 6 -- NLT<br>
1<br>
It was in the year King Uzziah died that I saw the Lord. He was sitting on a lofty throne, and the train of his robe filled the Temple.<br>
(It was in the year King Uzziah died. King Uzziah died in year 740 b.c.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2<br>
Attending him were mighty seraphim, each having six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.<br>
3<br>
They were calling out to each other,<br>
"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Heaven's Armies!<br>
The whole earth is filled with his glory!"<br>
4<br>
Their voices shook the Temple to its foundations, and the entire building was filled with smoke.<br>
5<br>
Then I said, "It's all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man. I have filthy lips, and I live amongst a people with filthy lips. Yet I have seen the King, the Lord of Heaven's Armies."<br>
6<br>
Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.<br>
7<br>
He touched my lips with it and said, "See, this coal has touched your lips. Now your guilt is removed, and your sins are forgiven."<br>
8<br>
Then I heard the Lord asking, "Whom should I send as a messenger to this people? Who will go for us?"<br>
I said, "Here I am. Send me."<br>
9<br>
And he said, "Yes, go, and say to this people,<br>
'Listen carefully, but do not understand.<br>
Watch closely, but learn nothing.'<br>
10<br>
Harden the hearts of these people.<br>
Plug their ears and shut their eyes.<br>
That way, they will not see with their eyes,<br>
nor hear with their ears,<br>
nor understand with their hearts<br>
and turn to me for healing."<br>
<br>
The Greek version of verses 9 and 10:<br>
And he said, "Go and say to this people,<br>
'When you hear what I say, you will not understand.<br>
When you see what I do, you will not comprehend.'<br>
For the hearts of these people are hardened,<br>
and their ears cannot hear, and they have closed their eyes --<br>
so their eyes cannot see,<br>
and their ears cannot hear,<br>
and their hearts cannot understand,<br>
and they cannot turn to me and let me heal them."<br>
<br>
This spot of scripture, Isaiah 6, verses 9 and 10, is quoted by Jesus in<br>
Matt 13:14-15; Mark 4:12; Luke 8:10; and in the book of Acts 28:26-27.<br>
<br>
Let's return to the Hebrew version, starting in Isaiah 6, verse 11, NLT:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
11<br>
Then I said, "Lord, how long will this go on?"<br>
And he replied,<br>
"Until their towns are empty,<br>
their houses are deserted,<br>
and the whole country is a wasteland;<br>
12<br>
until the Lord has sent everyone away,<br>
and the entire land of Israel lies deserted.<br>
13<br>
If even a tenth -- a remnant -- survive,<br>
it will be invaded again and burned.<br>
But as a terebinth or oak tree leaves a stump when it is cut down,<br>
so Israel's stump will be a holy seed."<br>

Seven Places was a Christian rock band that was commercially active from 2000 to 2005.<br>
Seth Gilbert was the main songwriter and vocalist.<br>
From 2006 until 2011, most of the band members continued to create and release original songs under the name of<br>
Applegate Christian Fellowship. They had three albums made,<br>
The Psalms Project (Album) -- 2008<br>
The Psalms Project Volume 2 (EP) -- 2010<br>
The Psalms Project Volume 3 (Album) -- 2011<br>
<br>
Here are the lyrics to two songs from their album,<br>
Hear Us Say Jesus<br>
which was released on 05 October 2004.<br>
The second song, titled, I Look Upon Your Hill, was originally titled, Hidden.<br>
It was a hidden track placed at the end of their album, titled, Free, which was released in 2000.<br>
It was hidden because, there were several seconds of silence placed at the end of the previous track, which gave the impression that the CD was done playing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the words to the 2004 song,<br>
"Be My Salvation"<br>
from Seven Places<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Plead my cause oh Lord, fight for me<br>
Be my shield, stand for me<br>
<br>
<br>
Jesus, my King<br>
My God, my friend, my everything<br>
And I'll sing to You, I'll sing to Your name<br>
Be my salvation<br>
<br>
Let the Lord be magnified, give Him praise.<br>
Let me shout for joy, and be glad in His name<br>
<br>
Jesus, my King<br>
My God, my friend, my everything<br>
And I'll sing to You, I'll sing to Your name<br>
Be my salvation<br>
<br>
I see the Lord, seated on the throne, exalted<br>
And the train of His robe, fills the temple with glory<br>
with glory<br>
<br>
<br>
Jesus, my King<br>
My God, my friend, my everything<br>
And I'll sing to You, I'll sing to Your name<br>
Be my salvation<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the lyrics to<br>
"I Look Upon Your Hill"<br>
Originally called, "Hidden", by Seven Places.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I look upon Your hill<br>
Your broken body hanging still<br>
Your blood drips down<br>
Your face and brow<br>
You brought me life through death<br>
No greater Love than this<br>
<br>
<br>
Surely He's borne our grief<br>
Carried our sorrow<br>
Though we've gone astray<br>
It's by His stripes and wounds<br>
We were healed<br>
On that glorious day.<br>
<br>
<br>
I look upon Your hill<br>
Your broken body hanging still<br>
Your blood drips down<br>
Your face and brow<br>
You brought me life through death<br>
No greater Love than this<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh Lord, You've worn the crown<br>
I've placed upon Your head<br>
Oh Lord, I've pierced Your hands<br>
Yet Your blood declares my innocence<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Surely He's borne our grief<br>
Carried our sorrow<br>
Though we've gone astray<br>
It's by His stripes and wounds<br>
We were healed<br>
On that glorious day.<br>

Ecclesiastes 7:12 (GNV -- The Geneva Bible)<br>
12 Say not thou, Why is it that the former days were better then these? for thou doest not enquire wisely of this thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Verse 12 in the GNV ended up being verse 10 in the KJV.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 7:10<br>
KJV<br>
10 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.<br>
(thou dost not enquire out of wisdom concerning this.)<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 7:10<br>
NLT<br>
10<br>
Don't long for "the good old days."<br>
This is not wise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a sample from the book of<br>
Ecclesiastes 6 & 7<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes, starting in chapter 6, verse 7<br>
and continuing to read until we get to<br>
chapter 7, verse 24.<br>
KJV<br>
(All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the soul is not filled.)<br>
7 All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.<br>
<br>
<br>
8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?<br>
<br>
(Better is the sight of the eyes than the walking of the soul: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.)<br>
9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
10 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.<br>
<br>
<br>
11 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?<br>
<br>
(For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, the number of the days of the life of his vanity? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?)<br>
12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?<br>
<br>
<br>
1 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.<br>
<br>
2 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.<br>
<br>
Commentary: Compare the next verse to the Put-Away list in Ephesians 4:31. It says in that Put-Away List to put away all anger.<br>
Putting away all anger is very true and wise. Be that as it may, this next verse, Ecclesiastes 7:3, can also be very true and wise.<br>
May the Lord reveal to us his good wisdom from above on how both of these verses can be applied.<br>
Additionally, when we get to verse 9 here in just a moment, the advice on anger down there in verse 9 swings right back into alignment with the put-away-all-anger advice in Ephesians 4:31.<br>
Listen for additional wisdom on anger, here in just a moment, when we get to verse 9. Meanwhile, check out what we read here in verse 3.<br>
Again, Ephesians 4:31 says in that Put-Away List to put away all anger.<br>
And, Ecclesiastes 7:3 says...<br>
<br>
<br>
(Anger is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.)<br>
3 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.<br>
<br>
<br>
4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.<br>
<br>
<br>
5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.<br>
<br>
(For as the sound of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.)<br>
6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.<br>
8 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.<br>
<br>
<br>
10 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.<br>
(for thou dost not enquire out of wisdom concerning this.)<br>
<br>
(Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea, better too: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.)<br>
11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.<br>
<br>
(For wisdom is a shadow, and money is a shadow: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.)<br>
12 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.<br>
<br>
<br>
13 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?<br>
<br>
(In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath made the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.)<br>
14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.<br>
<br>
<br>
15 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.<br>
<br>
<br>
16 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?<br>
(Why shouldest thou be desolate?)<br>
<br>
17 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?<br>
(why shouldest thou die not in thy time?)<br>
<br>
18 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.<br>
19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.<br>
20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.<br>
<br>
(Also give not thine heart unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:)<br>
21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:<br>
<br>
<br>
22 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.<br>
23 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.<br>
24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes, starting in chapter 6, verse 7<br>
and continuing to read until we get to<br>
chapter 7, verse 24.<br>
NLT<br>
7 All people spend their lives scratching for food, but they never seem to have enough.<br>
8 So are wise people really better off than fools? Do poor people gain anything by being wise and knowing how to act in front of others?<br>
9 Enjoy what you have rather than desiring what you don't have. Just dreaming about nice things is meaningless -- like chasing the wind.<br>
10 Everything has already been decided. It was known long ago what each person would be. So there's no use arguing with God about your destiny.<br>
11 The more words you speak, the less they mean. So what good are they?<br>
12<br>
In the few days of our meaningless lives, who knows how our days can best be spent? Our lives are like a shadow. Who can tell what will happen on this earth after we are gone?<br>
1<br>
A good reputation is more valuable than costly perfume.<br>
And the day you die is better than the day you are born.<br>
2<br>
Better to spend your time at funerals than at parties.<br>
After all, everyone dies -- <br>
so the living should take this to heart.<br>
3<br>
Sorrow is better than laughter,<br>
for sadness has a refining influence on us.<br>
4<br>
A wise person thinks a lot about death,<br>
whilst a fool thinks only about having a good time.<br>
5<br>
Better to be criticised by a wise person<br>
than to be praised by a fool.<br>
6<br>
A fool's laughter is quickly gone,<br>
like thorns crackling in a fire.<br>
This also is meaningless.<br>
7<br>
Extortion turns wise people into fools,<br>
and bribes corrupt the heart.<br>
8<br>
Finishing is better than starting.<br>
Patience is better than pride.<br>
9<br>
Control your temper,<br>
for anger labels you a fool.<br>
10<br>
Don't long for "the good old days."<br>
This is not wise.<br>
11<br>
Wisdom is even better when you have money.<br>
Both are a benefit as you go through life.<br>
12<br>
Wisdom and money can get you almost anything,<br>
but only wisdom can save your life.<br>
13<br>
Accept the way God does things,<br>
for who can straighten what he has made crooked?<br>
14<br>
Enjoy prosperity whilst you can,<br>
but when hard times strike, realise that both come from God.<br>
Remember that nothing is certain in this life.<br>
<br>
15<br>
I have seen everything in this meaningless life, including the death of good young people and the long life of wicked people.<br>
16 So don't be too good or too wise! Why destroy yourself?<br>
<br>
<br>
17 On the other hand, don't be too wicked either. Don't be a fool! Why die before your time?<br>
<br>
(Pay attention to these instructions, for anyone who fears God will follow them both.)<br>
18 Pay attention to these instructions, for anyone who fears God will avoid both extremes.<br>
<br>
19 One wise person is stronger than ten leading citizens of a town!<br>
20 Not a single person on earth is always good and never sins.<br>
21 Don't eavesdrop on others -- you may hear your servant curse you.<br>
22 For you know how often you yourself have cursed others.<br>
23 I have always tried my best to let wisdom guide my thoughts and actions. I said to myself, "I am determined to be wise." But it didn't work.<br>
24 Wisdom is always distant and difficult to find.<br>

Love, Mercy and Grace<br>
<br>
<br>
Commentary: This Bible Study contains several verses that we have looked at previously, in some of our previous studies. Even though we have read some of these verses before, they are still very important, and it would be good and healthy for us to consider them again. So, we will start by reading some verses again that we have gone over before. Let them enter into you again, meditate on them again, and give these next several verses some good and careful thought.<br>
<br>
<br>
We begin by looking once again at the second thief that was hanging on a cross next to Jesus:<br>
At first, the second thief is talking to the first thief, then he talks to Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luke 23, verses 40 through 43, KJV:<br>
...Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?<br>
And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.<br>
And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.<br>
And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
"...Don't you fear God even when you have been sentenced to die?<br>
We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man hasn't done anything wrong."<br>
Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom."<br>
And Jesus replied, "I assure you, today you will be with me in paradise."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jesus is with his disciples, and the disciples ask Jesus this question...<br>
<br>
Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. -- John 6: 28 & 29 (KJV)<br>
<br>
John 6: 28 & 29 -- NLT:<br>
They replied, "We want to perform God's works, too. What should we do?"<br>
Jesus told them, "This is the only work God wants from you: Believe in the one he has sent."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 139:16<br>
KJV<br>
16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, (all of them, my members were written, what days they should be fashioned,) which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.<br>
<br>
Psalms 139:16<br>
NLT<br>
16<br>
You saw me before I was born.<br>
Every day of my life was recorded in your book.<br>
Every moment was laid out<br>
before a single day had passed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45: 3-5 KJV<br>
3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the Lord, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.<br>
4 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.<br>
5 I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:<br>
<br>
<br>
Isaiah 45: 3-5<br>
NLT<br>
3<br>
And I will give you treasures hidden in the darkness --<br>
secret riches.<br>
I will do this so you may know that I am the Lord,<br>
the God of Israel, the one who calls you by name.<br>
4<br>
"And why have I called you for this work?<br>
Why did I call you by name when you did not know me?<br>
It is for the sake of Jacob my servant,<br>
Israel my chosen one.<br>
5<br>
I am the Lord;<br>
there is no other God.<br>
I have equipped you for battle,<br>
though you don't even know me,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 3: 4 - 7 (KJV)<br>
...the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,<br>
Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<br>
<br>
<br>
Titus 3:5 (NLT)<br>
he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 2:20 (NLT)<br>
I will be faithful to you and make you mine, and you will finally know me as the Lord.<br>
<br>
Hosea 14:4 (NLT)<br>
The Lord says, "Then I will heal you of your faithlessness; my love will know no bounds, for my anger will be gone forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 14: verses 1 and 2, then verse 4 again NLT<br>
1<br>
Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God,<br>
for your sins have brought you down.<br>
2<br>
Bring your confessions, and return to the Lord.<br>
Say to him,<br>
"Forgive all our sins and graciously receive us,<br>
so that we may offer you our praises.<br>
<br>
(Forgive all our sins and graciously receive us,<br>
so that we may repay the fruit of our lips; so that we may repay the bulls of our lips.)<br>
4<br>
The Lord says,<br>
"Then I will heal you of your faithlessness;<br>
my love will know no bounds,<br>
for my anger will be gone forever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosea 14: verses 1 and 2, then verse 4 KJV<br>
1 O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.<br>
2 Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and (give good,) receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.<br>
4 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.<br>
<br>
When we had studied all of Isaiah 6 here recently, do you remember the mention of lips, there in verses 5, 6 and 7?<br>
<br>
Isaiah 6: 5-7 NLT<br>
5<br>
Then I said, "It's all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man. I have filthy lips, and I live amongst a people with filthy lips. Yet I have seen the King, the Lord of Heaven's Armies."<br>
6<br>
Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.<br>
7<br>
He touched my lips with it and said, "See, this coal has touched your lips. Now your guilt is removed, and your sins are forgiven."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 15:16 (NLT)<br>
You didn't choose me. I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for, using my name.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
John 15: 12-17 KJV<br>
12 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.<br>
13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<br>
14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.<br>
15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.<br>
16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.<br>
17 These things I command you, that ye love one another.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2:8 & 9 NLT<br>
8 God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can't take credit for this; it is a gift from God.<br>
9 Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 (KJV)<br>
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
<br>
<br>
Remembering again, Billy Graham's Life Verse...<br>
<br>
Galatians 6:14<br>
KJV:<br>
But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.<br>
<br>
NLT:<br>
As for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that cross, because of him, my interest in this world has been crucified, and the world's interest in me has also died.<br>
<br>
<br>
Galatians 2:16 (KJV)<br>
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.<br>
<br>
Galatians 2:16 NLT:<br>
16 Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Corinthians 12:9 (KJV)<br>
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.<br>
NLT:<br>
"My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness."<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 6:14 (KJV)<br>
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.<br>
<br>
<br>
We will be looking at a few Hebrew and Greek word definitions from various Hebrew and Greek Lexicons,<br>
primarily from the Strong's Hebrew Lexicon,<br>
and the Brown-Driver-Briggs' Hebrew Definitions for Old Testament Hebrew words,<br>
and, mainly, the Strong's Greek Lexicon and the Thayer's Lexicon for New Testament Greek words.<br>

dominion -- sin shall not have dominion...<br>
Sin shall not...<br>
lord over<br>

<br>
Exodus 33: 12-14 NLT:<br>
You have told me, 'I know you by name, and I look favourably on you.'<br>
13 If it is true that you look favourably on me, let me know your ways so I may understand you more fully and continue to enjoy your favour. And remember that this nation is your very own people."<br>

Romans 10:9 (KJV)<br>
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br>
Romans 10:9 -- Saved<br>
Saved:<br>
keep, heal, preserve, rescue.<br>
deliver or protect<br>
salvation from spiritual disease and death, in which sense it is<br>
"spoken of in Scripture as either past, present, or future, according as redemption, grace, or glory<br>
(past redemption, present grace, future glory)<br>
keep safe and sound, to rescue from danger or destruction<br>
to deliver from the penalties of the Messianic judgement<br>

Psalms 123:3 (KJV)<br>
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 51:1 (KJV)<br>
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 51:1 -- blot out my transgressions<br>
Blot out, means this...<br>
He takes your sins, your transgressions, and he does this to them...<br>
erase<br>
wipe out<br>
blot out, obliterate<br>
exterminate<br>
to blot out (from memory)<br>
full of marrow<br>
<br>
Commentary: full of marrow?-- blood is made in the marrow of bone<br>
That's why none of his bones were broken, so he could make the blood that blots out the sin.<br>
He always had enough blood. He could always make enough blood.<br>
What can wash away our sins? Nothing but the blood of Jesus, made from the marrow of the bone, the marrow that blots out my transgressions.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 9:20 (KJV)<br>
Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.<br>
<br>
Matthew 26:28 (KJV)<br>
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 13: 20 & 21 KJV<br>
20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,<br>
21 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that I mentioned it...<br>
Nothing But the Blood of Jesus, was written and composed in 1876 by Robert Lowry.<br>
Lowry is credited with writing over 500 hymns, including the very popular and famous 1864 hymn, Hanson Place, more commonly known as, Shall We Gather at the River? or simply "At the River"<br>
which is heard in dozens of movies over many years, mainly old Westerns.<br>
Shall We Gather at the River is referencing Revelation 22:1-2 -- Gather with the saints at the river That flows by the throne of God.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, Let's read Psalms 51:1 one more time, then we will move on and read the definition for the Hebrew word, Mercies.<br>
Once again, Psalms 51:1 (KJV)<br>
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jeremiah 42:12 (KJV)<br>
And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mercies:<br>
compassion (in the plural) compassions; by extension, the womb (as cherishing the foetus, the American spelling is, as cherishing the fetus);<br>
by implication, a maiden:-- bowels, compassion, damsel, tender love, (great, tender) mercy, pity, womb.<br>
to love, especially to compassionate:--have compassion (on, upon), love, (find, have, obtain, shew) mercy(-iful, on, upon),<br>
(have) pity,<br>
<br>
<br>
Mercies, there in Jeremiah 42:12, is also, compassions, in Lamentations 3:22.<br>
Mercies and compassions are both the same Hebrew word in these two verses...<br>
<br>
Lamentations 3:22 (KJV)<br>
It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 6:4 (KJV)<br>
Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.<br>
<br>
<br>
In Psalms 6:4, the Hebrew word there for, Save, means this...<br>
be saved, be delivered<br>
to be liberated<br>
to be saved (in battle), be victorious<br>
to save from moral troubles<br>
to give victory to<br>

Again, we read<br>

God is love.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1 John 4:10 (KJV)<br>
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<br>
<br>
1 John 4: 9 & 10 NLT<br>
9 God showed how much he loved us by sending his one and only Son into the world so that we might have eternal life through him.<br>
10 This is real love -- not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 1-5 -- KJV<br>
1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<br>
2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.<br>
3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:<br>
4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<br>
5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 2-4 -- NLT<br>
(the law of the life-giving Spirit has freed you and has freed me from the law of sin that leads to death.)<br>
the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you (and has freed me) from the power of sin that leads to death.<br>
3 The law of Moses (the Torah) was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature.<br>
(The law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our flesh.)<br>
So God did what the law (the Torah) could not do. He sent his own Son in a body like the bodies we sinners have. And in that body God declared an end to sin's control over us by giving his Son as a sacrifice for our sins.<br>
4 He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Matthew 26:28 (KJV)<br>
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.<br>

Romans 8 NLT Repeating again some verses that we just read...<br>
1 So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
(And because you belong to him, the law of the life-giving Spirit has freed you and has freed me from the law of sin that leads to death.)<br>
2 And because you belong to him, the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you (and has freed me) from the power of sin that leads to death.<br>

37 No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.<br>
38 And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God's love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, (nor rulers,) neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow -- not even the powers of hell can separate us from God's love.<br>
39 No power in the sky above or in the earth below -- indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
1 With Christ as my witness, I speak with utter truthfulness. My conscience and the Holy Spirit confirm it.<br>
<br>
Before Jesus:<br>
Isaiah 59:2 KJV<br>
your iniquities have separated between you and your God,<br>

Romans 8: 1-6 KJV<br>
1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<br>

3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:<br>
4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<br>
5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.<br>
6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 8: 37, 38, and 39, and then stopping at Romans 9:1 KJV<br>
37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.<br>
38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,<br>
39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>

Romans 11: 5 & 6 KJV<br>
5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.<br>
6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.<br>
<br>
Romans 11: 5 & 6 NLT:<br>
(It is the same today, for a remnant have remained faithful because of God's grace.)<br>
5 It is the same today, for a few of the people of Israel have remained faithful because of God's grace -- his undeserved kindness in choosing them.<br>
6 And since it is through God's kindness, then it is not by their good works. For in that case, God’s grace would not be what it really is -- free and undeserved.<br>

2 John 1:10 & 11 (KJV)<br>

<br>
2 John 1: 9-11 -- NLT<br>
9 Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God. But anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both the Father and the Son.<br>
10 If anyone comes to your meeting and does not teach the truth about Christ, don't invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement.<br>
11 Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work.<br>
<br>
Hosea 4:6 (NLT)<br>
My people are being destroyed because they don't know me. Since you priests refuse to know me, I refuse to recognise you as my priests. Since you have forgotten the laws of your God, I will forget to bless your children.<br>

18 And may you have the power to understand, as all God's people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is.<br>
19 May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God.<br>

1 Corinthians 2:9 & 10 KJV<br>
9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<br>
10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 2:9 & 10 NLT<br>
9<br>
That is what the Scriptures mean when they say,<br>
"No eye has seen, no ear has heard,<br>
and no mind has imagined<br>
what God has prepared<br>
for those who love him."<br>
<br>
(That previous verse, verse 9, was a quote from Isaiah 64:4.)<br>
<br>
(For it was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit.)<br>
10<br>
But it was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit. For his Spirit searches out everything and shows us God's deep secrets.<br>

Isaiah 64:4 <br>
NLT<br>

no ear has heard<br>

who works for those who wait for him!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Every time I read about Jesus being raised up and lifted up,<br>
it reminds me of what Forgiveness means.<br>
Do you remember what we studied here recently? Let's think about it again.<br>
In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for, Forgiveness, means,<br>
take away, carry off,<br>
to lift, lift up<br>
to bear, carry, support, sustain, endure<br>
to be lifted up, be exalted<br>
to lift oneself up, rise up<br>
to be borne, be carried<br>
to be taken away, be carried off, be swept away<br>
<br>
Keep that in mind as we read from John Chapter 6.<br>
<br>
John 6: 37-41 KJV<br>
37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.<br>
38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.<br>
39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.<br>
40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.<br>
41 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.<br>
<br>
John 6 37-41 NLT<br>
37 ...those the Father has given me will come to me, and I will never reject them.<br>
38 For I have come down from heaven to do the will of God who sent me, not to do my own will.<br>
39 And this is the will of God, that I should not lose even one of all those he has given me, but that I should raise them up at the last day.<br>
40 For it is my Father's will that all who see his Son and believe in him should have eternal life. I will raise them up at the last day."<br>
41 Then the (Jewish) people began to murmur in disagreement because he had said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 10: 12-14 KJV<br>
12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.<br>
13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.<br>
14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.<br>
<br>
1 Corinthians 10: 12-14 NLT<br>
12 If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall.<br>
13 The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure.<br>
14 So, my dear friends, flee from the worship of idols.<br>

Romans 4: 6-8 KJV<br>
6...David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,<br>
7 Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.<br>
8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.<br>
<br>
<br>
Romans 4: 4-8 NLT<br>
4 When people work, their wages are not a gift, but something they have earned.<br>
5 But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners.<br>
6 David also spoke of this when he described the happiness of those who are declared righteous without working for it:<br>
7<br>
"Oh, what joy for those<br>
whose disobedience is forgiven,<br>
whose sins are put out of sight.<br>
8<br>
Yes, what joy for those<br>
whose record the Lord has cleared of sin."<br>
<br>
Those last two verses, verse 7 and 8, were quoted from the Greek version of<br>
Psalms 32:1-2.<br>
Where it said, sin, in the Greek version, that originally was a Hebrew word that meant, guile, which means, guilt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 32:1-2 KJV -- A Psalm of David giving instruction<br>
1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.<br>
2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.<br>
<br>
Psalms 32 is a maskil. The Hebrew word, maskil, may be a literary or musical term.<br>
<br>
Psalms 32:1-2 NLT<br>
A psalm of David. (A maskil of David.)<br>
1<br>
Oh, what joy for those<br>
whose disobedience is forgiven,<br>
whose sin is put out of sight!<br>
2<br>
(what joy for those whose record the Lord has cleared of sin.)<br>
<br>
Yes, what joy for those<br>
whose record the Lord has cleared of guilt,<br>
whose lives are lived in complete honesty!<br>

2 Timothy 2:19 KJV<br>
19...The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2:19 NLT<br>
19...God's truth stands firm like a foundation stone with this inscription:<br>
"The Lord knows those who are his," (Numbers 16:5)<br>
and<br>
"All who belong to the Lord must turn away from evil."<br>
(Isaiah 52:11)<br>
<br>
Commentary: I find it interesting that the KJV mentioned the name of Christ, yet the NLT did not. The NLT said, The Lord, instead of the name of Christ.<br>
That should not be very much of any concern, because we know that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Heavenly Father and the Messiah Son are one and the same, and we are able to nameth the name of Christ, because we know what his actual, true, revealed name is.<br>
We reveal what others conceal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2 & 3<br>
2 Timothy 2: 19, reading all the way to chapter 3, verse 9.<br>
KJV<br>
19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.<br>
20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.<br>
21 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.<br>
22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.<br>
24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,<br>
25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;<br>
26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.<br>
1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.<br>
2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,<br>
3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,<br>
4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;<br>
5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.<br>
6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,<br>
7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.<br>
8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.<br>
9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 2 & 3<br>
2 Timothy 2: 19, reading all the way to chapter 3, verse 9.<br>
NLT<br>
19 But God's truth stands firm like a foundation stone with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his," (Numbers 16:5) and "All who belong to the Lord must turn away from evil." (Isaiah 52:11)<br>
<br>
<br>
20 In a wealthy home some utensils are made of gold and silver, and some are made of wood and clay. The expensive utensils are used for special occasions, and the cheap ones are for everyday use.<br>
21 If you keep yourself pure, you will be a special utensil for honourable use. Your life will be clean, and you will be ready for the Master to use you for every good work.<br>
22 Run from anything that stimulates youthful lusts. Instead, pursue righteous living, faithfulness, love, and peace. Enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with pure hearts.<br>
23 Again I say, don't get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights.<br>
24 A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people.<br>
25 Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people's hearts, and they will learn the truth.<br>
26 Then they will come to their senses and escape from the devil's trap. For they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants.<br>
1 You should know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times.<br>
2 For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred.<br>
3 They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good.<br>
4 They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God.<br>
5 They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that!<br>
6 They are the kind who work their way into people's homes and win the confidence of (and take captive) vulnerable women who are burdened with the guilt of sin and controlled by various desires.<br>
7 (Such women are forever following new teachings, but they are never able to understand the truth.)<br>
8 These teachers oppose the truth just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses. They have depraved minds and a counterfeit faith.<br>
9 But they won't get away with this for long. Someday everyone will recognise what fools they are....<br>

Commentary:<br>
Mark Lowry is an American singer, comedian, and songwriter. He is best known for co-writing the song "Mary, Did You Know?" and being a member of the Gaither Vocal Band for about 17 years, from 1988 to 2001, and from 2009 to 2013.<br>
Mark Lowry has recorded twelve albums, of both music and stand-up comedy.<br>
The "Mary, Did You Know?" Christmas song has lyrics written by Mark Lowry in 1984, and then the music was written by Buddy Greene in 1991. It was originally recorded by Christian recording artist Michael English on his self-titled debut solo album in 1991.<br>
<br>
Mark Lowry made a song recording, titled, This Too Shall Pass, from his album, Mouth in Motion, in 1993.<br>
I believe it is within the video recording, Mark Lowry: Mouth in Motion, in 1993, when he says something similar to the following in that stand-up comedy video...<br>
My life verse is, This Too Shall Pass.<br>
Have things been really bad for you this past year?  Don't worry.  It'll pass.<br>
Have things been going really good for you this past year?  Don't worry.  It'll pass.<br>
<br>
Commentary: I thought that was quite hilarious, and his humour is very enjoyable.<br>
Since this is a Bible study, I wanted to take a look at his life verse.<br>
He neglected to mention where his life verse can be found in the Bible. This Too Shall Pass. Where is it in the Bible?  I'm sorry to inform you, Mark Lowry, that your so-called life verse does not exist in the Bible.<br>
It started to appear in some American literature, perhaps as early as 1839.<br>
Again, This Too Shall Pass, is not in the Bible, and is not a Bible verse.<br>
<br>
Here is a similar verse, but it does not work unless you first decide to commit and trust in the Lord, the Master, Yaw-Who-Wah.<br>
<br>
This too will not pass unless the Lord brings it to pass.<br>
<br>
<br>
Psalms 37:5 (KJV)<br>
Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.<br>
<br>
Lamentations 3:37 (KJV)<br>
Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, When the Lord commandeth it not?<br>
<br>
Lamentations 3:37 (NLT)<br>
Who can command things to happen without the Lord's permission?<br>
